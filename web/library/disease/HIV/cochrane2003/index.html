                              <p>The findings from observational
                              studies, reviews and meta-analyses,
                              supported by biological theories,
                              that circumcised men appear less
                              likely to acquire human
                              immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has
                              contributed to the recent ground
                              swell of support for considering male
                              circumcision as a strategy for
                              preventing sexually acquired
                              infection. We sought to elucidate and
                              appraise the global evidence from
                              published and unpublished studies
                              that circumcision can be used as an
                              intervention to prevent HIV
                              infection.</p>

                              interventional effect of male
                              circumcision for preventing

                               2) To examine the feasibility and

                              <p>We searched online for published
                              and unpublished studies in The
                              Cochrane Library (issue 2, 2002),

                              2001). We also searched databases
                              listing conference abstracts, scanned
                              reference lists of articles and
                              contacted authors of included

                              <p>We searched for randomized and
                              quasi-randomized controlled trials of
                              male circumcision or, in their
                              absence, observational studies that
                              compare acquisition rates of HIV-1
                              and HIV-2 infection in circumcised
                              and uncircumcised heterosexual
                              men.</p>

                              <p class="Level2">Data collection and
                              analysis</p>

                              <p>Independent reviewers selected
                              studies, assessed study quality and
                              extracted data. We stratified studies
                              based on study design and on whether
                              they included participants from the
                              general population or high-risk
                              groups (such as patients treated for
                              sexually transmitted infections). We
                              expressed findings as crude and
                              adjusted odds ratios (OR) together
                              with their 95% confidence intervals
                              (CI) and conducted a sensitivity
                              analysis to explore the effect of
                              adjustment on study results. We
                              investigated whether the method of
                              circumcision ascertainment influenced
                              study outcomes.</p>

                                <p class="Level2">Main Results</p>

                                <p>We identified no completed
                                randomized controlled trials. Three
                                randomized controlled trials are
                                currently underway or commencing
                                shortly. We found 34 observational
                                studies: 16 conducted in the
                                general population and 18 in
                                high-risk populations. It seems
                                unlikely that potential confounding
                                factors were completely accounted
                                for in any of the included studies.
                                In particular, important risk
                                factors, such as religion and
                                sexual practices, were not
                                adequately accounted for in many of
                                the included studies.</p>

                                <p>General population study
                                results:<br />
                                 The single cohort study (N = 5516)
                                showed a significant difference in
                                HIV transmission rates between
                                circumcised and uncircumcised men
                                [OR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.96].
                                Results for the 14 cross-sectional
                                studies were inconsistent, with
                                point estimates for unadjusted odds
                                ratios varying between 0.28 and
                                1.73. Six studies had statistically
                                significant results, four in the
                                direction of benefit and two in the
                                direction of harm. The test for
                                heterogeneity between the
                                cross-sectional studies was highly
                                significant (chi-square = 77.59; df
                                = 13; P-value &lt; 0.00001). Nine
                                studies reported adjusted odds
                                ratios with eight in the direction
                                of benefit, ranging from 0.26 to
                                0.80. Use of adjusted results
                                tended to show stronger evidence of
                                an association although they
                                remained heterogenous (chi-square =
                                75.2; df = 13; P-value &lt;
                                0.00001). Only one case-control
                                study was found (N = 51) which had
                                a non-significant result [OR =
                                1.90; 95% CI: 0.50 to 7.20].<br />
                                <br />
                                </p>

                                <p>High-risk group study
                                results:<br />
                                 The four cohort studies identified
                                found a protective effect from
                                circumcision with point estimates
                                for unadjusted odds ratios varying
                                from 0.10 to 0.39. Two of these
                                studies had statistically
                                significant results. Two studies
                                reported adjusted odds ratios, both
                                protective with one being
                                significant. The chi-square test
                                for between-study heterogeneity was
                                not significant (chi-square = 5.21;
                                df = 3; P-value = 0.16). All eleven
                                cross-sectional studies reporting
                                unadjusted results found benefit
                                from circumcision, eight of which
                                had statistically significant
                                results. Estimates of effect varied
                                from an unadjusted odds ratio of
                                0.10 to 0.66. Between-study
                                heterogeneity was significant with
                                the chi-square = 29.77; df = 10;
                                P-value = 0.0009. Four of these
                                studies reported adjusted odds
                                ratios ranging from 0.20 to 0.59
                                and all were significant. One
                                additional cross-sectional study
                                only reported an adjusted odds
                                ratio in the direction of benefit
                                which was statistically
                                significant. All three case-control
                                studies found a protective effect
                                of circumcision on HIV status, two
                                being statistically significant.
                                Point estimates varied from
                                unadjusted odds ratios of 0.37 to
                                0.88. One reported an adjusted odds
                                ratio showing a significant
                                protective effect.<br />

                                existing observational studies show
                                a strong epidemiological

                                especially among high-risk groups.
                                However, observational studies are
                                inherently limited by confounding

              <p>Male circumcision is defined as the surgical
              removal of all or part of the prepuce (foreskin) of
              the penis and may be practiced as part of a religious
              ritual usually conducted shortly after birth or in
              childhood; as a medical procedure related to
              infections, injury or anomalies of the foreskin; or
              as part of a traditional ritual performed as an
              initiation into manhood (Horizons 00). For over a
              decade observational studies have suggested an
              association between male circumcision and HIV
              infection in males. Most of these studies suggest a
              protective effect of male circumcision on HIV
              acquisition in men.</p>

              <p>Six reviews (<a href="#O-18">Moses 94</a>; <a
              href="#O-6">De Vincenzi 94</a>; <a href="#O-19">Moses
              98</a>; <a href="#O-27">Van Howe 99</a>; <a
              href="#O-29">Weiss 00</a>; <a href="#O-1">Bailey
              01</a>) and one meta-analysis (<a href="#O-29">Weiss
              00</a>) of these observational studies have been
              published, reaching different conclusions on the
              association between male circumcision and HIV
              infection. However, search strategies are not clearly
              described in all the reviews, several focused only on
              published studies and confounding was not always
              assessed adequately. The most rigorous is a
              systematic review and meta-analysis of published
              studies on HIV-1 infection in sub-Saharan Africa
              recently published by Weiss et al. (<a
              href="#O-29">Weiss 00</a>). Adjusted analyses
              produced an odds ratio (OR) of 0.42 (95% CI: 0.34 to
              0.54) for all studies combined (N=15) with an OR of
              0.55 (95% CI: 0.42 to 0.72) for population-based
              cross-sectional studies (N=5) and an OR of 0.24 (95%
              CI: 0.18 to 0.31) for cross-sectional studies of
              high-risk groups (N=4). The authors conclude that
              there is compelling evidence that male circumcision
              is associated with a reduced risk of HIV infection in
              sub-Saharan Africa while warning that residual
              confounding may exist in some studies due to
              behavioural or biological factors that are unknown or
              unmeasured.</p>

              <p>In this Cochrane review we are assessing the
              likelihood that use of circumcision as an
              intervention will reduce transmission of HIV
              infection to men. Thus our review differs in aim from
              previous reviews which have concentrated on assessing
              evidence of the association between circumcision and
              HIV. While randomised controlled trials are the ideal
              method for proving a causal effect of an
              intervention, observational studies may also provide
              weaker evidence of causality when the participants
              and exposure (circumcision) match what is likely to
              happen in an intervention programme, and when other
              confounding factors can be excluded.</p>

              <p>Known sources of confounding identified by all the
              above reviews include sexual behaviour, penile
              hygiene and religion. Circumcision itself may be a
              proxy measure of the knowledge and behaviour learnt
              during the process of initiation during which time
              young men are taught about traditional sexual
              practices, including monogamy, and penile hygiene.
              <span class="yellow">A potential confounder that has
              not been measured in any study to date, to our
              knowledge, is the use of vaginal drying agents in
              female partners of the men. This practice is
              reportedly common in parts of Africa (<a
              href="#O-2">Brown 93</a>; <a href="#O-23">Runganga
              95</a>; <a href="#O-16">Kun 98</a>) and may result in
              increased vaginal abrasions and micro-lacerations,
              possibly facilitating HIV transmission to both men
              and women.</span> Viral load is increasingly
              considered to be a crucial factor in HIV transmission
              (<a href="#O-22">Quinn 00</a>) and may be both an
              important confounder and an effect modifier.
              Misclassification of exposure is also an important
              source of bias given that some studies classify
              circumcision status by self-report rather than direct
              observation.</p>

              <p>Theories to support the biological basis for a
              protective effect of circumcision on HIV exist.
              Researchers have noted that the inner aspect of the
              foreskin is well-supplied with Langerhans cells (<a
              href="#O-25">Szabo 00</a>) and that <i>in vitro</i>,
              HIV-1 demonstrates a specific tropism (attraction)
              for these cells (<a href="#O-24">Soto-Ramirez
              96</a>), in particular the CD4 receptors (<a
              href="#O-14">Hussain 95</a>) on them. CD4 and other
              HIV co-receptors have been shown to facilitate HIV
              entry into host cells. According to this theory,
              circumcision would remove the potential entry site
              for HIV. However, not all Langerhans cells are
              removed during circumcision as even after the
              procedure, there is residual penile mucosa of the
              glands and there are also Langerhans cells in the
              penile shaft (<a href="#O-5">Cold 99</a>). In direct
              contradiction to the above theory, the inner prepuce
              contains apocrine glands which secrete lysozyme (<a
              href="#O-8">Fleiss 98</a>). Lysozyme reportedly kills
              HIV-1 <i>in vitro</i> (<a href="#O-17">Lee-Huang
              99</a>), suggesting a protective effect of the
              foreskin. As the study of the immunological function
              of the prepuce is not well-developed (<a
              href="#O-5">Cold 99</a>), caution must be observed
              when assuming <i>in vitro</i> viral behaviour is
              equivalent <i>in vivo</i>. In a recent study that
              used immunofluorescence and image analysis to
              quantify cells expressing HIV-1 co-receptors, adult
              foreskin mucosa had greater susceptibility to
              infection than cervical mucosa or the external
              surface of the foreskin tissue (<a
              href="#O-20">Patterson 02</a>).</p>

              <p>The presence of a sexually transmitted infection
              (STI) enhances HIV infection and susceptibility (<a
              href="#O-10">Grosskurth 95a</a>; <a href="#O-4">Cohen
              98</a>; <a href="#O-9">Fleming 99</a>). The role
              circumcision may play in the prevention of
              transmission of STIs is less certain, although it has
              been reported that male circumcision is associated
              with a reduced risk of genital ulcer disease,
              particularly chancroid and syphilis (<a
              href="#O-19">Moses 98</a>). It would therefore be
              valuable to examine the effectiveness of male
              circumcision for preventing acquisition of STIs
              through heterosexual intercourse. Should this
              relationship prove to be temporal, it is possible
              that circumcision may protect against HIV infection
              indirectly via decreased STI transmission.</p>

              <p><span class="yellow">Circumcision practices are
              largely culturally determined and as a result there
              are strong beliefs and opinions surrounding its
              practice. It is important to acknowledge that
              researchers' personal biases and the dominant
              circumcision practices of their respective countries
              may influence their interpretation of
              findings.</span></p>

              <p>Given the enormous mortality and morbidity
              associated with HIV/AIDS, it seems reasonable to
              fully explore potential prevention measures,
              including male circumcision. However, promoting or
              instituting mass circumcision may have profound
              cultural and social implications and represents a
              formidable public health challenge (<a
              href="#O-3">Cohen 00</a>). The risk of surgical wound
              infection following circumcision must be considered.
              Of particular concern is the potential negative
              impact introduction of circumcision may have on
              current health promotion endeavours to promote sexual
              behavioural change. If circumcision were actively
              promoted as an HIV prevention measure, there is some
              risk that men might seek circumcision in the belief
              that they can become fully protected from HIV,
              resulting in a lack of condom use. The following
              systematic review seeks to inform this debate by
              presenting the evidence from both published and
              unpublished studies which examine the association
              between male circumcision and HIV-1 and HIV-2
              infection by heterosexual intercourse.</p>

                <p>Randomised or quasi-randomized controlled
                trials. We pre-specified that should data be
                insufficient, i.e., no randomised controlled trials
                (RCTs) identified, data from observational studies
                (e.g. cohort, case-control and cross-sectional
                studies) would be considered for inclusion in this
                review according to the HIV/AIDS Cochrane Review
                Group policy (HIV CRG). Studies performed in
                general or specific populations and in hospitals or
                clinics were included. Studies performed in any
                country and published in any language were
                included. Studies with historical controls and
                ecological studies were excluded as these provide

                foreskin of the penis either as a medical
                intervention or via cultural or religious practices
                that involve cutting off the foreskin. Circumcision
                status was determined by self- or partner-report or
                by direct observation.</p>

              <p>1. Electronic searching</p>

              <p>a. MEDLINE online (1966 to 2002) was searched in
              April 2002 using the following search strategy</p>

              <p>1 ("hiv 1"[MeSH Terms] OR "hiv 2"[MeSH Terms]) OR
              HIV<br />
               2 "hiv infections"[MeSH Terms]<br />

              Circumcision terms}<br />
              <br />
              </p>

              <p>This yielded 152 abstracts. We did not limit the
              search by using methodological filters (e.g. only
              searching for RCTs). [We initially searched linking
              "HIV" and "risk factors" without limiting the search
              to "circumcision". However, this search yielded over
              12,000 citations and we decided that any additional
              studies obtained from this search would not justify
              the additional time and resources to appraise 12,000
              abstracts.] We also did not search using terms for
              "sexually transmitted infections".</p>

              <p>b. EMBASE online (1966 to 2002) was searched in
              February 2002 using the following search
              strategy<br />

              <p>c. An initial online AIDSLINE search (incorporates
              AIDS meeting and conference abstracts and books) was
              done in April 2001 and updated on online GATEWAY in
              August 2001 using the following search strategy</p>

              <p>#1 HIV-1 [MESH]<br />
               #2 HIV-2[MESH]<br />
               #3 HIV<br />

               #7 #5 AND #7<br />
              <br />
              </p>

              <p>This yielded a total of 360 abstracts. We were
              unable to locate many of the authors of abstracts of
              potentially eligible studies presented during the
              1980s and early 1990s. Many of these abstracts may
              overlap with published studies included in this
              review, but we were unable to confirm this in many
              cases. Further assessment of the abstracts is
              currently underway and results will be included in
              future updates of the review.</p>

              <p>2. All databases included in The Cochrane Library
              (issue 2, 2002) were searched for *circumcision* and
              yielded 137 results. These all referred to neonatal
              circumcision and did not relate to HIV/AIDS.</p>

              <p>3. Reference lists<br />
               Reference lists of all the studies which went into
              the pool of retrieved studies, including those of
              other reviews, were examined in order to identify any
              further studies.<br />
              <br />
              </p>

              <p>4. Personal contact<br />
               We attempted to contact authors of studies initially
              selected for inclusion in order to identify further
              relevant studies.<br />
              <br />
              </p>

              <p>5. Excluded Databases<br />
               SciSearch, CINAHL and LILACS were not searched due
              to resource limitations and the probability that the
              yield was likely to be small.<br />

              <p>The titles, abstracts and descriptor terms of all
              downloaded material from the electronic searches were
              read by NS and MM and irrelevant reports were
              discarded. All citations identified were then
              independently inspected by NS and MM to establish
              relevance of the article according to the
              pre-specified criteria. Where there was uncertainty
              as to the relevance of the study, the full article
              was obtained.</p>

              <p>1. Selection of studies<br />
              NS and MM independently applied the inclusion
              criteria, and differences were resolved by
              discussions with a third reviewer, JV. Studies were
              reviewed for relevance based on study design, types
              of participants, exposures and outcome
              measures.<br />

              Data were extracted independently by NS and MM. No
              RCTs were found. Standardised data extraction forms -
              one for cohort/cross-sectional studies and one for
              case-control studies - were used. The following

              <p>(a) External validity<br />
               - was the sample a census, consecutive sample or
              random sample? (CT, CS)<br />
               - were at least 80% of those eligible to participate
              in all groups recruited?<br />
              <br />
              </p>

              <p>(b) Performance bias<br />
               - was circumcision status ascertained by genital
              examination (direct observation)?<br />
               - were assessors of circumcision status blinded to
              HIV status? (CC, CS)<br />
               - was the same method of ascertainment used in cases
              and controls? (CC)<br />
              <br />
              </p>

              <p>(c) Detection bias<br />
               - was HIV status ascertained using an ELISA test,
              Western blot or particle agglutination test?<br />
               - was HIV status confirmed using a different or
              second test from this list?<br />
               - were assessors of HIV status blinded to
              circumcision status (or tests undertaken in an
              independent laboratory)?<br />
              <br />
              </p>

              <p>(d) Attrition bias<br />
               - were circumcised and uncircumcised groups followed
              for the same time? (CT)<br />
               - were at least 80% of participants in all groups
              included in the final analysis or was the description
              of those not included not suggestive of bias?<br />
              <br />
              </p>

              <p>(e) Selection bias<br />

              start of study? (CT)<br />
               - were cases selected from the general population?
              (CC)<br />

              the cases? (CC)<br />
              <br />
              </p>

              <p>(f) Control of confounding<br />
               - the following factors were pre-specified by the
              review team as potential confounders, and it was
              noted whether they were demonstrated to be similar in
              both groups, matched in the design or adjusted for in
              the analysis. The item received an asterisk (*) if
              the factor was balanced between circumcised and
              uncircumcised groups (CS and CT) or between HIV
              positive and negative groups (CC), matched, or
              adjusted for in the analysis. An absence of an (*)
              indicates that the factor was either not measured or,
              if it was, it did not meet the (*)
              requirements.<br />

              <p>The methodological quality of the included cohort,
              case-control and cross-sectional studies was
              evaluated independently by NS and MM. One further
              reviewer (JD) checked the use of quality assessment.
              Reviewers were not blinded to the names of the
              authors, institutions, journal of publication or
              results of the studies.</p>

              <p>4. Data synthesis<br />
              Incomplete data<br />
              Where data were incomplete, attempts were made to
              contact the authors for clarification of important
              information. This was successful in a number of
              instances and acknowledgement of this is included in
              the Table of Included Studies.<br />
              <br />
              </p>

              <p>Outcome measures<br />
              All outcomes included in this review are binary.
              Measures of association for each study are expressed
              as odds ratios together with their 95% confidence
              intervals. Due to current limitations in software we
              present only unadjusted odds ratios in the METAVIEW
              figures. When adjusted odds ratios were reported, we
              note these in the QUALITY WEBTABLE. When graphical
              depiction of adjusted odds ratios becomes possible,
              such plots will be included in an update of the
              review.<br />
              <br />
              </p>

              <p>In the <a
              href="/library/disease/HIV/cochrane2001/">protocol</a>
              we pre-specified that meta-analysis would be
              conducted if data allowed and where appropriate.
              However, due to the heterogeneous results this was
              not appropriate and a narrative synthesis was
              undertaken. More details are given in the RESULTS
              section. The results are presented graphically as
              forest plots in METAVIEW. The Chi-square test for
              heterogeneity was used to provide an indication of
              between-study heterogeneity as pre-specified in the
              <a
              href="/library/disease/HIV/cochrane2001/">protocol</a>.
              In addition, the degree of heterogeneity observed in
              the results was quantified using the I-squared
              statistic (Higgins 02) which can be interpreted as
              the percentage of variation observed between the
              studies attributable to between-study differences
              rather than the play of chance.</p>

              <p>Stratified analysis<br />
              Studies are presented stratified by study design and
              within study design, and further stratified by
              general population/high risk group as pre-specified
              in the protocol.<br />
              <br />
              </p>

              <p>Investigations of heterogeneity<br />
              The <a
              href="/library/disease/HIV/cochrane2001/">protocol</a>
              pre-specified investigating the impact of method of
              circumcision ascertainment, HIV-1 and HIV-2,
              background prevalence and publication status on study
              findings. Only the first factor could be investigated
              with the data obtained. Meta-regression to explore
              the effect of risk group and study design on the
              adjusted results was conducted using STATA.<br />
              <br />
              </p>

              <p>Sensitivity analysis<br />
              The <a
              href="/library/disease/HIV/cochrane2001/">protocol</a>
              pre-specified doing a sensitivity analysis to assess
              the impact of using adjusted rather than crude
              results and published versus unpublished results. As
              no meta-analysis was conducted, we were not able to
              conduct a quantitative sensitivity analysis but
              instead provide a narrative description of the
              differences between crude and adjusted results.
              Direct evidence of publication bias could not be
              investigated as only two unpublished studies were
              obtained. Excessive heterogeneity in study results
              prevented use of indirect tests for publication bias,
              such as funnel plots.<br />

              the sixth column: Allocation Concealment, is not
              applicable to this review as no RCTs were
              identfied.</p>

              <p>No completed randomised controlled trials were
              identified. However, the authors are aware of a RCT
              already underway in Kisumu, Kenya (<a
              href="#S-45">Bailey 02</a>) and another trial which
              was scheduled to commence in Rakai, Uganda in March
              2002 (<a href="#s-46">Gray 02</a>). The Kisumu trial
              will have a completed sample size of 2,276 in total
              and the Rakai trial will have 2500 men in each of two
              groups. A third trial (<a href="#S-44">Auvert
              03</a>), with a sample size of 3,500, commenced in
              Gauteng Province in South Africa in 2003.</p>

              <p>Altogether we identified 35 observational studies
              which met review inclusion criteria. Sixteen of these
              studies had been conducted in general population
              settings, and 19 had been conducted in high-risk
              population settings. We defined high-risk studies as
              those studies conducted in settings where HIV
              infection rate is either known to be high or the
              setting provides conditions conducive to the spread
              of HIV. In this review high-risk studies were those
              conducted in sexually transmitted infection (STI)
              clinics, hospital and outpatient departments,
              specific high-risk occupational groupings, such as
              long-distance truck drivers, and prison settings.</p>

              <p>The observational studies were of three different
              designs. Typically their objectives were to
              investigate multiple risk factors for HIV infection
              with no specific focus on the role of circumcision.
              Twenty-five studies were cross-sectional surveys
              undertaken at a single time point. Participants were
              tested for HIV at the same time that risk factors
              were elicited. Five of the studies were cohort
              incidence studies which followed a group known to be
              HIV-negative over time, identifying new cases by
              repeated HIV testing. Risk factors for infection were
              usually elicited at baseline. Several cohort studies
              were based on groups identified as HIV-negative in a
              cross-sectional study. Four studies were of
              case-control designs, where the prevalence of
              potential risk factors for HIV in a sample of cases
              known to be HIV positive was compared with the
              prevalence in a control sample known to be
              HIV-negative.</p>

              <p>Overall study quality was highly variable.</p>

              <p>Performance bias (misclassification of exposure)
              may be present in all studies where circumcision
              status was obtained by self-report rather than direct
              observation. Fifteen studies assessed circumcision
              status by self-report and 20 by direct
              observation.</p>

              <p>Detection bias was rare across all studies as
              nearly all studies (n=33) used blinded methods for
              assessing and confirming HIV status.</p>

              <p>All five cohort studies included in the review
              were susceptible to attrition bias as
              loss-to-follow-up was greater than 20% (<a
              href="#S-23">Mehendale 96</a>; <a href="#S-20">Lavrey
              99</a>), unequal between circumcised and
              uncircumcised groups (<a href="#S-10">Cameron
              89</a>), or unclear (<a href="#S-32">Telzak 93</a>;
              <a href="#S-14">Gray 00</a>).</p>

              <p>Selection bias was problematic in all studies, and
              results were potentially confounded by other risk
              factors for transmission of HIV, such as sexual
              behaviour and religion. Circumcised and uncircumcised
              groups (in cohort and cross-sectional studies) and
              HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups (in case-control
              studies) were seldom balanced for all or most of the
              ten risk factors that we identified as potential
              confounders prior to the quality assessment (see ).
              Statistical adjustments for measured confounding
              factors were made in 14 of the 35 included studies.
              The adjusted confounders differed across studies in
              number and type.<br clear="all" />

              <p>We stratified the studies according to whether
              they were conducted in the general population or
              whether they were conducted in high risk groups. The
              studies were further stratified according to study
              type i.e. cohort, cross-sectional and case-control
              studies. Our protocol specified that meta-analysis
              would be conducted within these strata, where
              appropriate. However, meta-analysis was not performed
              as many of the studies had a high likelihood of bias
              and heterogeneous results, suggesting that any
              overall summary statistic is likely to be misleading.
              Synthesis focused on describing the direction and
              consistency of effect, assessing the likelihood of
              bias, and investigating factors that may explain
              differences between the results of studies. We used
              the odds ratio to permit comparison of results of
              cross-sectional and cohort studies with those of
              case-control studies, for which the odds ratio is the
              only valid estimator of effect. Odds ratios greater
              than 1 indicate increased risk of HIV infection with
              circumcision and odds ratios less than 1 indicate
              decreased risk of HIV infection with
              circumcision.</p>

              <p>GENERAL POPULATION STUDY RESULTS:</p>

              <p>We identified one cohort study, 14 cross-sectional
              studies and one case-control study conducted in the
              general population. The unadjusted results are
              graphically depicted in Table 01 in METAVIEW. The
              adjusted results are presented in, and .<br

              <p>The single cohort study (<a href="#S-14">Gray
              00</a>) (N = 5,516) showed a significant difference
              in HIV transmission rates between circumcised and
              uncircumcised men [OR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.96].
              The adjusted OR was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.33 to 0.87).</p>

              <p>The 14 cross-sectional studies (<a
              href="#S-34">Van de Perre 87</a>; <a
              href="#S-6">Barongo 92</a>; <a href="#S-30">Serwadda

              01Sc</a>; <a href="#S-5">Auvert 01Sd</a>) had
              inconsistent findings. Eight studies were in the
              direction of benefit whilst six were in the direction
              of harm, with point estimates of odds ratios varying
              between 0.28 and 1.73. Six studies had statistically
              significant results, four in the direction of benefit
              and two in the direction of harm. The test for
              heterogeneity was highly significant (chi-square =
              77.59; df = 13; P-value &lt; 0.00001). Eighty-six
              percent of the variability observed between the
              studies was attributable to between-study differences
              and not random variation. Nine studies reported
              adjusted odds ratios with eight in the direction of
              benefit, ranging from 0.26 to 0.80. Use of adjusted
              results tended to show stronger evidence of an
              association although they remained heterogenous
              (chi-square = 75.2; df = 13; P-value &lt; 0.00001),
              83% of the variability in adjusted results not being
              explicable by chance alone.</p>

              <p>Only one case-control in a general population
              setting was included (<a href="#S-27">Pison 93</a>).
              This study was small (N = 51) and found no
              significant difference in HIV transmission rates
              between circumcised and uncircumcised men [OR = 1.90;
              95% CI: 0.50 to 7.20].</p>

              <p>HIGH-RISK GROUP STUDY RESULTS</p>

              <p>We identified four cohort studies, 12
              cross-sectional studies and three case-control
              studies conducted in high-risk groups. The unadjusted
              results are graphically depicted in Table 02 in
              METAVIEW. The adjusted results are presented in , and

              <p>The four cohort studies (<a href="#S-10">Cameron
              89</a>; <a href="#S-32">Telzak 93</a>; <a
              href="#S-23">Mehendale 96</a>; <a href="#S-20">Lavrey
              99</a>) were all in the direction of benefit from
              circumcision and two of them had statistically
              significant results. Point estimates varied from odds
              ratios of 0.10 to 0.39. The chi-square test for
              between-study heterogeneity was not significant
              (chi-square = 5.21; df = 3; P-value = 0.16). However,
              42% of the variability in results was not explicable
              by chance. The studies were clinically diverse: two
              were conducted in Kenya, one in truck drivers (<a
              href="#S-20">Lavrey 99</a>), and the other in a STI
              clinic (<a href="#S-10">Cameron 89</a>); the third
              study was conducted in a STI clinic in India (<a
              href="#S-23">Mehendale 96</a>) and the fourth in a
              STI clinic in New York City (<a href="#S-32">Telzak
              93</a>).</p>

              <p>Unadjusted results from 11 cross-sectional studies
              (<a href="#S-15">Greenblatt 88</a>; <a
              href="#S-31">Simonsen 88</a>; <a href="#S-12">Diallo
              92</a>; <a href="#S-13">Gilks 92</a>; <a

              href="#S-19">Lankoande 98</a>) were in the direction
              of benefit, eight being statistically significant.
              Estimates of effect varied from odds ratios of 0.10
              to 0.66. Between-study heterogeneity was significant
              with the chi-square = 29.77; df = 10; P-value =
              0.0009. Sixty-six percent of the variability in
              results was not explicable by chance. Four of the
              cross-sectional studies report adjusted odds ratios
              ranging from 0.20 to 0.59, and all were significant.
              One additional study (a href="#S-22"&gt;Mbugua 95)
              only reported an adjusted odds ratio in the direction
              of benefit which was statistically significant; no
              data were provided to calculate an unadjusted odds
              ratio.</p>

              <p>Three case-control studies (<a href="#S-11">Carael
              88</a>; <a href="#S-28">Sassan 96</a>; <a
              href="#S-21">MacDonald 01</a>) met inclusion criteria
              and were all in the direction of a protective effect
              of circumcision on HIV status, two being
              statistically significant. Point estimates varied
              from odds ratios of 0.37 to 0.88. The test for
              between-study heterogeneity was marginal (chi-square
              = 4.36; df = 2; P-value = 0.11). Fifty-four percent
              of the variation in results could not be explained by
              the play of chance. One study (<a
              href="#S-24"></a>Sassan 96) reported an adjusted OR
              of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.30 to 0.77).</p>

              <p>SUB-GROUP ANALYSIS</p>

              <p>Our pre-specified decisions to stratify results by
              risk group and study design was supported by the
              results of the studies. Studies in high-risk groups
              were significantly more in favour of circumcision
              than those done in general-population studies
              (P-value = 0.001 by meta-regression of adjusted
              results), and differences were observed between study
              designs for the high-risk studies (P-value = 0.03 for
              cross-sectional compared with case-control; P-value =
              0.06 for cohort compared with case-control).
              Insufficient numbers of cohort and case-control
              studies were included to make the same comparison
              amongst general-population studies.</p>

              <p>We were able to conduct a sub-group analysis on
              mode of establishing circumcision status: self-report
              versus direct observation. Due to the small number of
              studies in some strata, it was only possible to do
              this for cross-sectional studies within the general
              population group (Table 03 METAVIEW). All five
              cross-sectional studies using direct observation
              indicated a benefit of circumcision (observed odds
              ratios ranged from 0.28 to 0.95), while the nine
              studies based on self-report reported a mixture of
              benefit (three studies) and harm (six studies) (odds
              ratios ranging from 0.37 to 1.88). Between-study
              heterogeneity was suggested in the sub-group of
              self-reported studies (chi-square = 80.66; df = 8;
              P-value &lt; 0.00001). The test for heterogeneity was
              marginal in the direct observation sub-group
              (chi-square = 7.21; df = 4; P-value = 0.13). The
              difference between the groups did not reach
              statistical significance (P-value = 0.12). Results
              from studies using direct observation were still
              heterogeneous, 45% of the observed variability not
              being explicable by chance.</p>

              <p>We were not able to conduct sub-group analysis on
              HIV-1 versus HIV-2 status as many studies did not
              clearly report on the type of HIV, and those studies
              which measured both often did not differentiate
              between the two types in analysis. Twenty of the
              studies assessed HIV-1 status only, one study only
              included HIV-2, six studies included both HIV-1 and
              HIV-2 and five studies were unclear whether HIV-1 or
              HIV-2 was measured.</p>

              <p>We were also not able to conduct sub-group
              analysis on background prevalence of HIV in the
              sampled populations as this information was
              unavailable for almost all studies.</p>

              <p>SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS</p>

              <p>A sensitivity analysis was planned to examine the
              difference between crude and adjusted estimates of
              treatment effects. Seventeen studies reported both
              crude and adjusted effects. In general, adjustment
              made little difference to the size, direction or
              significance of effects in eleven studies. The six
              studies with substantial differences between crude
              and adjusted results all changed in favour of a
              protective effect of circumcision. In three, both
              unadjusted and adjusted results were not significant
              (<a href="#S-8">Barongo 95</a>; <a
              href="#S-18">Kisesa 96</a>; <a href="#S-17">Kelly
              99</a>). In Barongo 92, while the unadjusted result
              indicated significant harm (OR = 1.66; 95% CI: 1.10
              to 2.50), the adjusted result suggested a benefit (OR
              = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.30) albeit non-significant.
              In Serwadda 92 a non-significant unadjusted odds
              ratio of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.32 to 1.39) became a
              statistically significant adjusted odds ratio of 0.40
              (95% CI: 0.20 to 0.90). In Grosskurth 95a a
              significant crude odds ratio of 1.73 (95% CI: 1.28 to
              2.35) reduced to an adjusted odds ratio of 1.25
              although information about its significance was not
              reported. All these studies were cross-sectional
              studies in the general population. Use of adjusted
              results where available made little difference in the
              observed degree of heterogeneity</p>

              <p>We had hoped to conduct a sensitivity analysis
              looking at published versus unpublished studies, but
              only two unpublished studies (<a href="#S-8">Barongo

              in the review.</p>

              <p>INDIVIDUAL PATIENT DATA ANALYSIS</p>

              <p>In the light of forthcoming results from RCTs, we
              determined that it would not be of value to further
              explore the results of the included studies using IPD
              analysis. IPD analysis is dependant on obtaining
              original data. When we contacted authors we enquired
              whether they would be able to provide us with the
              original data. In most cases, authors stated that
              this would not be possible. An IPD analysis would
              therefore not be feasible.</p>

              <p>ADVERSE EFFECTS</p>

              <p>No studies reported on the adverse effects of
              circumcision. In most studies, exposure to
              circumcision had taken place during childhood or
              adolescence, before the studies commenced.</p>

              <p>CHOICE OF MAJOR PUBLICATION</p>

              <p>A number of the included studies are described in
              more than one publication. In some cases, additional
              analyses conducted after completion of a study were
              reported in additional publications. Where methods of
              study design were described in additional
              publications, we used both reports to inform our data
              extraction. Where additional analyses were conducted,
              we chose to include one of the studies as the primary
              study as described below.</p>

              <p>Five studies underwent re-analysis to specifically
              assess the association between male circumcision and
              HIV prevention, in an article by Urassa et al. (<a
              href="#O-26">Urassa 97</a>). We used the original
              articles and reports (two unpublished) to report the
              methods and quality assessment and to calculate the
              unadjusted odds ratios of the five included studies
              (<a href="#S-6">Barongo 92</a>; <a
              href="#S-7">Barongo 94</a>; <a href="#S-8">Barongo
              95</a>; <a href="#O-10">Grosskurth 95a</a>; <a
              href="#S-18">Kisesa 96</a>). Adjusted odds ratios for
              the individual studies reported in Urassa 97 are
              included in our results.</p>

              <p>An article by Quigley et al. (<a
              href="#O-21">Quigley 97</a>) reports on a
              case-control study nested within the cross-sectional
              study Grosskurth 95a and therefore reports on a
              sample of the same individuals included in the
              cross-sectional study. We report only the results of
              the cross-sectional study to avoid duplication.</p>

              <p>Information for the included cohort study, Gray
              00, was obtained from two articles (<a
              href="#O-28">Wawer 99</a>; <a href="#S-14">Gray
              00</a>). Individuals were followed-up by home visits
              every 10 months and the study duration was 20 months
              in the trial reported in Wawer 99. However, cohort
              surveillance was continued beyond 20 months and was
              reported in Gray 00. We therefore chose to include
              the results for the longer follow-up period. An
              additional analysis of a subsample of the cohort
              reported in Gray 00 followed HIV-discordant couples
              over time. These were identified retrospectively in
              1999. Linked data on the sero-status of partners was
              not available during the conduct of the study (1994
              to 1998). We therefore did not include this
              sub-sample as the men were already included in the
              general population cohort, to avoid duplication.</p>

              <p>There are currently no RCTs assessing the
              effectiveness of male circumcision in preventing HIV
              acquisition in heterosexual men. However, three large
              trials, Bailey 02 (N = 2776), Gray 02 (N = 5000) and
              Auvert 03 (N=3500) are currently underway and are
              scheduled for completion in 2005/06. Properly
              conducted RCTs are regarded as the best method of
              assessing the effectiveness of health care
              interventions as they generate comparable
              intervention and non-intervention groups with the
              only differences between the groups being
              attributable to the effect of the intervention, or
              chance (<a href="#O-15">Kleijnen 97</a>).</p>

              <p>Due to the lack of RCT evidence, and prompted by
              publication of other reviews that reported that male
              circumcision provides a protective effect on HIV
              acquisition in heterosexual men, we assessed the
              evidence of the benefits of circumcision available
              from observational studies. Observational studies
              differ in two important ways from RCTs. First, the
              intervention (circumcision) did not occur as part of
              the study, nor was it likely that it occurred
              directly for reason of possible HIV prevention. Most
              study participants were likely to be circumcised for
              cultural or religious reasons. In addition, age of
              circumcision was not reported in most studies and
              could have an influence on results. If circumcision
              was conducted after HIV acquisition a potential
              protective effect could be missed. Secondly, the
              studies were not designed to have comparable
              circumcised and non-circumcised groups. As HIV is
              related to sexual behaviour, which may in turn be
              partly determined by culture and religion, strong
              confounding in these studies seems likely.</p>

              <p>In assessing the quality of the observational
              studies we identified ten potentially important
              confounders that studies would need to ensure were
              either balanced between circumcised and uncircumcised
              groups or, if unbalanced, that they were adequately
              adjusted for. From the tabulation of the quality
              assessments, it is clear that many studies either did
              not measure these variables or, if these were
              reported, they were either not balanced between
              groups or not adjusted for. Religion was measured as
              a potential confounder in a number of studies, but in
              few studies was it either balanced between groups or
              adequately adjusted for. Of those that did report
              confounders, choice of included confounders was
              highly variable across studies. It is important to
              note that observational studies, unlike RCTs, can
              only adjust for known confounders, and only then if
              they are measured without error. The effect of
              unknown confounders may well be operating in either
              direction within and across all of the included
              studies. Misclassification of confounders can greatly
              hinder the effectiveness of any statistical
              adjustment procedure (Deeks IP).</p>

              <p>We observed differences in results according to
              study design, confirming that study design is an
              important consideration in the interpretation of
              results. Also, we noted that the method of
              ascertaining circumcision status seemed likely to
              have an influence on study results. How much the
              results are influenced by other aspects of study
              quality is unclear, but overall the studies included
              in this review fail to meet many of our pre-specified
              quality criteria. Whilst they may have been the best
              studies that could have been undertaken in the
              circumstances, there is potential for bias, which can
              act in either direction and explain some of the
              observed heterogeneity in results.</p>

              <p>The studies from high-risk groups included in this
              review do report a powerful protective effect of
              circumcision, measured by both unadjusted and
              adjusted odds ratios. More mixed results were
              reported for the general population. Although use of
              adjusted results tended to show stronger evidence of
              an association than the unadjusted results in general
              population studies, between-study heterogeneity
              remained significant. Population studies undertaken
              using direct observation were more in favour of
              circumcision. As self-report is known to be a poor
              means of assessing exposure, it would seem reasonable
              to favour the results generated from those studies
              using direct observation only. Self-report could
              affect the results in either direction depending on
              what the reason for over- or under-reporting in a
              particular setting is. However, other aspects of
              quality in these studies may be compromised: for
              example, four of the five included studies in this
              sub-group were not rated highly on external validity,
              potentially introducing bias that may affect results
              in either direction.</p>

              <p>While we have followed a rigorous protocol during
              the conduct of this review, the review is still
              subject to a number of limitations and may be prone
              to indexing bias, publication bias and reporting
              bias. Our search strategy was limited to the term
              "circumcision" which yielded abstract numbers ranging
              from 143 to 360 abstracts depending on the database
              searched. However, when the search included the
              broader term "risk factors", the yield was over
              12,000 abstracts. It was not considered feasible to
              appraise this many abstracts on a balance between
              yield and time. It is therefore possible that studies
              appraising circumcision, but not indexed as such, may
              have been missed.</p>

              <p>The search of conference proceedings provided a
              yield of 360 abstracts, mostly of presentations from
              the International AIDS Conferences. Although some of
              these appeared to overlap with published articles, we
              have had difficulty confirming this with authors,
              especially those from the 1980s and early 1990s. It
              is therefore highly likely that some studies
              presented at these conferences have not been
              published and are therefore not included in our
              review. We plan to continue to pursue this for future
              updates of the review.</p>

              <p>We believe the presence of reporting bias is a
              major limitation of our review and, indeed, of other
              previously published reviews. Unless we were able to
              contact researchers to obtain missing data, we relied
              on the data reported in the article. In many cases
              reporting was unclear regarding factors relating to
              study quality (e.g., participation rates,
              ascertainment of circumcision status, measurement of
              confounding variables and whether these were balanced
              and/or adjusted for), provision of actual numbers,
              percentages and details of statistical analyses. Some
              studies may have included circumcision as a risk
              factor and, on finding it to be non-significant,
              failed to report on it. In general, we chose to
              report unclear issues as such rather than making
              assumptions. Where necessary, we have been explicit
              about assumptions that we have had to make. The
              strength of the review could be greatly improved if
              it were possible to contact all researchers and
              obtain original data.</p>

              <p>Despite the above limitations, the generally
              positive results of these studies do indicate that
              further urgent evaluation of circumcision is
              required. However, as the observed results could be
              explained by likely confounding, randomised trials
              are essential before circumcision is implemented as a
              public health intervention. This will also ensure
              that the use of male circumcision as a preventive
              strategy does more good than harm. The implementation
              of circumcision as a public health intervention will
              encounter cost, both financial and in terms of
              potential personal harm; no adverse effects are
              reported in this review only because none of the
              observational studies investigated them. Feasibility
              issues of implementation are beyond the scope of this
              review but need to be carefully considered.</p>

              <p>Obtaining individual participant data for each
              study would have allowed us to perform a standard
              adjustment for confounding factors on all studies, if
              appropriate variables had been measured. Whilst this
              could potentially improve the quality of the included
              studies, it would not resolve the major problems
              inherent to observational studies. In the light of
              forthcoming results from RCTs, the value of investing
              time obtaining and re-analysing individual patient
              data sets for the included studies is doubtful.</p>

              <p>The review raises a number of important points
              that future trial designs should take into
              account.</p>

              <p>1. Age at circumcision varied from at birth to
              early adulthood, both across and within studies. In a
              trial, age at circumcision should be in a narrow
              range. Short-term trials will need to be conducted on
              sexually active adults and longer trials on
              pre-adolescents to adequately assess the effect on
              HIV acquisition.</p>

              <p>2. Risk of acquisition of HIV depends on sexual
              practices that may be culturally or religiously
              linked. A trial design will need to recruit
              sufficient numbers across diverse cultural and
              religious groups to account for this.</p>

              <p>3. Trials must measure sexual practices,
              especially any changes from pre-circumcision
              behaviour, to evaluate how sexual behaviour after
              circumcision affects risk of exposure to HIV.</p>

              <p>4. Trials must measure and report any adverse
              effects of circumcision.</p>

              <p>In conclusion, whilst the positive results of the
              observational studies indicate that circumcision is
              an intervention worth evaluating in RCTs, the current
              quality of evidence is insufficient to consider
              implementation of circumcision as a public health
              intervention.</p>

                <p>Despite the positive results of a number of
                observational studies, there are not yet sufficient
                grounds to conclude that male circumcision, as a
                preventive strategy for HIV infection, does more
                good than harm. The results of current ongoing RCTs
                will need to be carefully considered before
                circumcision is implemented as a public health
                intervention for prevention of sexually transmitted
                HIV.</p>

                 <span class="yellow">It would be prudent for
                consumers to await the findings of ongoing

                <p>Randomised trials assessing the effects of male
                circumcision across diverse cultural and religious
                groups are urgently needed. Short-term trials will

                assess the effect on HIV acquisition. Trials must
                measure sexual practices, especially any changes
                from pre-circumcision behaviour, to evaluate
                whether the benefit of circumcision occurs through
                changed sexual behaviour or the absence of the

        <p>Male circumcision for prevention of heterosexual
        acquisition of HIV in men</p>

        <p>Circumcision in heterosexual men is associated with
        lower rates of HIV infection. This association is strongest
        in groups at high-risk of HIV infection. However there are
        no trials to show whether male circumcision as an
        intervention reduces HIV infection.</p>

        <p>Male circumcision is the surgical removal of the
        foreskin of the penis. It is a common religious or
        traditional ritual, and is sometimes done for medical
        reasons. It is not known if the foreskin affects sexual
        transmission of infection. Circumcision may be an indicator
        of men affected by other religious or traditional practices
        which lower the risk of HIV. The review found that men who
        have already been circumcised have lower rates of HIV
        infection than uncircumcised men. However, there is no
        strong evidence of the effects of male circumcision to try
        to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS. Trials are underway.</p>
