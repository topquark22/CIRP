      <h2>Risk factors for HIV-1 infection in adults in a rural
      Ugandan community: a case-control study.</h2>

      <h4>Malamba, S.S., Wagner, H.U., Maude, G., Okongo, M., Nunn,
      A.J., Kengeya-Kayondo, J.F., and Mulder, D.W.</h4>

      <p><a href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Medical
      Research Council</a> (UK) Programme on AIDS in Uganda,<br />
       Entebbe</p>

      <p>OBJECTIVE: To study in depth sexual history and sexual
      behaviour variables as risk factors for HIV-1 infection in a
      rural Ugandan population.</p>

      <p>METHODS: Following a socioeconomic and serological survey
      of a rural population in Masaka District, south-west Uganda,
      233 randomly selected HIV-1-positive cases and 233 negative
      controls matched on age and village of residence, were
      invited in October 1990 to participate in a case-control
      study. A total of 132 cases and 161 controls attended for
      in-depth investigation including an interview about sexual
      behaviour.</p>

      <p>RESULTS: The factor most strongly associated with
      increased risk of infection was a greater number of lifetime
      sexual partners, with odds ratios (OR) of 2.1 and 4.9 for
      those reporting 4-10 and 11 or more partners, respectively,
      compared with those reporting less than four partners. Having
      only one sexual partner did not provide complete protection,
      a total of seven (one male, six female) subjects reporting
      only one sexual partner were HIV-1-positive. Other
      significant factors were a history of genital ulcers [OR,
      2.9; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.0-9.1) and not being a
      Muslim (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 1.8-16.5) <span
      class="yellow">suggesting a possible protective effect of
      circumcision.</span> There was a suggestion that those who
      married within the last 7 years (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 0.9-6.1)
      and men exposed to menstrual blood (OR, 5.7; 95% CI,
      0.7-49.8) were at an increased risk of HIV-1 infection.</p>

      <p>CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the predominant role of
      sexual behaviour in the HIV-1 epidemic. Of particular concern
      is the observation of HIV-1 infection among those reporting
      only one partner. Where HIV-1 infection is widely distributed
      in the general population, risk reduction strategies should,
      in addition to the promotion of partner reduction, place
      strong emphasis on safe-sex techniques.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: This study claims a possible
      protective effect of circumcision based on a lower observed
      incidence of HIV in Muslims. Circumcision is a cultural
      marker. Comparison of diverse cultural groups is invalid
      because cultural differences include many compounding factors
      such as religion, sexual behavior and sexual mores.]</p>
