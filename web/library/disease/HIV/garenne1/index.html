    <div class="corpus">
      <p>In a recent article, Auvert and colleagues present the
      results of their randomized controlled trial on male
      circumcision to prevent HIV transmission [<a
      href="#n1">1</a>]. They conclude that male circumcision
      reduced the risk of HIV infection by some 60% (95% confidence
      interval, 32%&ndash;76%). The trial was certainly well
      conducted, and it nicely confirmed observational studies,
      which came to the same conclusion [<a href="#n2">2</a>].
      However, a number of their concluding statements deserve a
      comment.</p>

      <p>Auvert and colleagues claim a &ldquo;degree of protection
      equivalent to a vaccine of high efficacy&rdquo; [<a
      href="#n1">1</a>]. This is obviously overstated. A vaccine of
      high efficacy is expected to offer long-term protection of
      95% or above. Smallpox was eradicated with such a highly
      efficient vaccine. If control of tetanus, measles, and
      poliomyelitis has been largely achieved in the world, it has
      been a result of high-efficacy vaccines. Furthermore, the
      analogy with vaccines appears misleading. A 96%-efficient
      measles vaccine means that 96% of vaccinated persons exposed
      to measles are indeed protected against infection. Protection
      lasts for many years, and revaccination permits dealing with
      loss of immunity over time. What Auvert and colleagues show
      is different: they show a 60% reduction in disease incidence
      over an 18-month period among circumcised men compared with
      uncircumcised men with similar exposure. To our knowledge,
      this does not mean that those men are really
      &ldquo;protected&rdquo; against HIV, especially in the case
      of repeated exposure. It simply means &ldquo;reduced
      risk,&rdquo; or reduced probability of contamination.</p>

      <p>A closer analogy of the &ldquo;reduced risk&rdquo; offered
      by male circumcision is that offered by contraception. Modern
      and efficacious methods such as hormonal contraceptives
      (pill, injectables, implants) or intra-uterine devices (IUDs)
      do offer high protection, usually 99% or above for women who
      are exposed repeatedly (every month) to risk of pregnancy.
      Highly efficacious methods do protect these women against
      unwanted pregnancy. On the contrary, a less efficacious
      method such as rhythm method (periodic abstinence) reduces
      fecundity by some 50%, but offers little protection against
      unwanted pregnancy. Even though women using consistent rhythm
      methods will have a lower number of pregnancies over their
      lifetime than women who use no contraceptive methods at all,
      they will be unlikely to achieve their desired family size,
      as could women using highly effective methods.</p>

      <p>Similarly, for persons who are highly exposed to risk of
      HIV infection, as are the young men of South Africa, a 60%
      reduction in annual risk will ultimately protect only a
      smaller proportion. Basic probability calculations show that
      in discordant couples exposed for 30 years, some 74% will
      contract the HIV virus if circumcised, compared with 97% if
      uncircumcised (with incidence of 11% per year)&mdash;a small
      reduction indeed if compared with a highly efficacious
      vaccine (comparable figures would be 4% versus 97% for
      children vaccinated against measles who are exposed between 1
      and 15 years of age).</p>

      <p>One could argue that the population effect could exceed
      the individual risk for a variety of reasons ranging from
      herd immunity to prevention of other sexually transmitted
      diseases (STIs). If all men are circumcised, then prevalence
      among women will be lower, and men will have lower risk of
      being exposed and infected. However, several natural
      experiments do not confirm this argument. For instance,
      Tanzania has some 110 ethnic groups, some groups using
      universal male circumcision, others not circumcising. After
      controlling for urbanization, there was no difference in male
      HIV prevalence between the two groups: in urban areas, HIV
      seroprevalence was 9.5% in circumcised groups and 9.7% in
      uncircumcised groups, and conversely, 4.6% and 5.2%,
      respectively, in rural areas&mdash;none of the differences
      being significant [<a href="#n3">3</a>]. In South Africa, the
      KwaZulu-Natal province, where few are circumcised, has a
      higher HIV seroprevalence than other provinces, reaching 37%
      among antenatal clinic attendants in 2003. But, in the
      Eastern Cape, where circumcision is the rule, the dynamics of
      the epidemic are almost the same, simply lagging a few years
      behind, increasing from 4.5% in 1994 to 27% in 2003. Finally,
      it was argued that the large epidemic in Abidjan, C&ocirc;te
      d'Ivoire, and surrounding areas in the late 1980s was largely
      due to the lack of male circumcision of the local ethnic
      groups. This, however, did not impede the rapid increase in
      HIV infection among migrant workers from Burkina Faso and
      Mali living in Abidjan, who were circumcised.</p>

      <p>For highly exposed men, such as men living in southern
      Africa, the choice is either using condoms consistently, with
      extremely low risk of becoming infected, or being
      circumcised, with relatively high risk of becoming infected.
      This is quite similar to women's choice to either use a
      highly efficacious contraceptive method or use a folk method.
      Some women make the second choice for religious reasons, with
      the obvious consequences. Is there a rationale for promoting
      the idea of circumcision when better choices are available?
      Regular condom use was found to be protective at the
      individual level and also effective for stopping HIV
      epidemics, as in Thailand [<a href="#n4">4,5</a>].</p>

      <p>Concluding that &ldquo;male circumcision should be
      regarded as an important public health intervention for
      preventing the spread of HIV&rdquo; [<a href="#n1">1</a>]
      appears overstated. Even though large-scale male circumcision
      could avert a number of HIV infections, theoretical
      calculations and empirical evidence show that it is unlikely
      to have a major public health impact, apart from the fact
      that achieving universal male circumcision is likely to be
      more difficult than universal vaccination coverage or
      universal contraceptive use.</p>
