Sorry about any confusion I caused. There may be 22-23 studies which have 
looked at a possible link between circumcision and HIV infection. de 
Vincenzi's study is a must read, but as she and Mertens point out only a 
handful of the studies show a correlation between the foreskin and HIV 
infections. The vast majority show no statistically significant difference 
and and a handful of studies show a correlation between being circumcised and 
developing HIV. The problem is that two of the studies received a lot of 
press, in spite of serious methodological flaws, because they were published 
in Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine.

If you look at the authors of the studies out of Africa which show a 
correlation between the prepuce and HIV the same names (Plummer, Moses, 
Ronald, etc.) appear over and over. These men are now calling for routine 
circumcision in Canada and the US to prevent HIV infections...

I recommend everyone find a copy of de Vincenzi and Mertens article and read 
it. It's very technical but very useful.
