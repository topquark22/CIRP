        <h2>Evidence of iatrogenic HIV transmission in<br />
         children in South Africa</h2>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">In December 2002, the <a
      href="http://www.hsrc.ac.za/" target="_blank">Human Sciences
      Research Council (HSRC) of South Africa</a> published results
      from a national census-derived random sample survey of HIV
      prevalence and selected risk factors in South Africans aged
      two years and older (a total of 8840 persons provided
      interview data and a specimen for the HIV test: OraSure HIV-1
      oral specimen collection device was used with the Vironostika
      HIV Uni-Form Ii Plus O testing kit)<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup>. The survey revealed a prevalence of
      5.6% (131/2348) among 2&ndash;14 year olds, comparable to the
      4.2% reported in Rwandan urban children in 1986 in the last
      national HIV serosurvey in Africa that included
      children<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>. Only 6.1% of the
      HIV-infected South African children had a dead parent,
      whether due to AIDS or any other cause.</p>

      <p class="text2">A small subgroup of 20 children (aged
      2&ndash;11) was matchable to a biological parent with a known
      HIV test result, and only 5 of these infected children had an
      HIV-positive parent. This would support the hypothesis that
      up to three-quarters of HIV-infected 2&ndash;11 year olds may
      have been infected from a source other than their mother.
      Although the numbers are small and, therefore, results should
      be interpreted with caution, the observation in the same
      survey<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> that white children had
      an HIV prevalence of 11% (16/145), while white adults had one
      of 5.7%, also points to an important role for non-vertical
      HIV transmission. Surprised by such findings, HSRC
      investigators recommend epidemiologic investigation focussing
      on possible childhood sexual and/or iatrogenic exposure. As
      in any sample, there is the possibility of sampling bias, but
      this might have been less of a problem in this large survey
      than in other smaller ones.</p>

      <p class="text2">Neither the lay nor medical media seem to
      appreciate the HSRC report's implications: 5.6% of 2&ndash;14
      year olds in South Africa would translate into an estimated
      670,000 HIV-infected children, an inference not explicitly
      drawn in the report. This is 2.7 times larger than
      conventional estimates for vertically infected children
      between 0 and 15 years old, only about half of which would be
      2 years or older. The conventional estimates are based on the
      proportion of women in antenatal sentinel surveys with HIV,
      on assumptions about mother-to-child transmission and
      neonatal survival and on presumed negligible HIV transmission
      through other routes<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">For hundreds of thousands of South African
      children to have acquired HIV sexually, inordinately high
      levels of childhood sexual exposure would be required, a
      phenomenon unlikely to have been overlooked by
      paediatricians. Recent reports from South Africa discourage
      this hypothesis. For example, in a large survey of women in
      South Africa, only 1.6% reported having been raped before age
      15<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>; and despite extensive media
      coverage of infected men seeking virgin girls as a `cure' for
      their HIV infection, few cases have been documented<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup>. In another South African
      investigation, the rate of HIV seroconversion following child
      rape was 1% only, which, along with previous reports, argues
      against high transmission efficiency even under such
      circumstances<sup><a href="#n6">6,7</a></sup>. American
      experience<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> points to a
      female-to-male ratio in child rape cases of about 5.5:1,
      whereas HSRC investigators report virtual sex parity in their
      sample's HIV-infected children. Only 1.4% of 12&ndash;14 year
      olds in the HSRC sample reported being sexually experienced,
      a rate lower than in other surveys of similarly aged South
      Africans<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>. Rates of partner
      accumulation and of sexual activity among sexually
      experienced youth respondents were also modest. Even assuming
      substantial under-reporting of sexual behaviours, the
      preponderance of HIV infections in children in the South
      African HSRC sample remains unexplained.</p>

      <p class="text2">These data are also consistent with many
      other African studies reporting HIV-positive children with
      HIV-negative mothers<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>. HIV
      infection of children in the South African sample through
      non-sterile medical procedures is a more reasonable
      hypothesis than the sexual one and is supported by much other
      evidence. For example, a large study of sexual risk factors
      for HIV infection in four African cities&mdash;two with high
      and two with low prevalence&mdash;found that rate of partner
      change, sex with prostitutes, concurrent partnerships and
      lack of condom use were not more common in high prevalence
      cities<sup><a href="#n10">10,11</a></sup>. The authors
      concluded that sampling bias, shifts in sexual behaviour over
      time or misreporting by respondents did not explain their
      observations<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>. Failure to find
      an association of sexual behaviour with community HIV disease
      burdens suggests that non-sexual means of transmission may be
      contributing substantially.</p>

      <p class="text2">In a previous paper<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup>, we reported unexplained high rates of
      HIV incidence in African women during antenatal care and
      postpartum: In five studies of incidence in HIV-negative
      cohorts&mdash;in Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, South Africa and
      Zimbabwe&mdash;from first antenatal visit to delivery and in
      the months after delivery, HIV incidence ranged from 6.2 to
      21 per 100 person years<sup><a
      href="#n13">13&ndash;18</a></sup> After allowing for possible
      sexual transmission [assuming (a) the proportion of women
      with HIV-positive partners is equal to the percentage of
      women who were HIV-positive in the sample from which the
      cohort was drawn and (b) HIV transmission from seropositive
      partners of 10 per 100 person years, which is the average
      from five studies of African women with HIV-positive partners
      continuing unprotected sex], these studies show unexplained
      incidence of 4&ndash;19 per 100 person years<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup>. In Malawi, HIV incidence during the
      antenatal and postpartum periods combined fell from 21 per
      100 person years in 1990 to 1.1 per 100 in 1994&ndash;1995,
      while HIV prevalence&mdash;and presumably risk for sexual
      transmission&mdash;increased. Evidence points to health care
      risks during antenatal care, including the drawing of blood,
      tetanus immunisation and other procedures.</p>

      <p class="text2">The rates of unexplained incidence in these
      five studies are similar to the mortality rates of
      6&ndash;16% from puerperal fever reported by Semmelweis in
      Vienna in 1841&ndash;1946<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup>.
      All obstetricians will be well aware that that was eventually
      attributed to the effect of the physicians' unclean hands. It
      is possible therefore that even some of the childhood cases
      attributable to vertical transmission may also ultimately be
      due to iatrogenic causes.</p>

      <p class="text2">We recently reported a discordance between
      rapid HIV transmission levels in the context of decreasing
      sexually transmitted disease diagnoses and increasing condom
      use, in Zimbabwe<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup>. Other clues
      to inadvertent health care transmission include the fact that
      injections for treatment of sexually transmitted infections
      are more strongly associated with HIV infections than are
      sexually transmitted infections themselves and that higher
      health care access and use are associated with increased
      HIV/AIDS risk<sup><a href="#n9">9</a>,<a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">There is mounting
      evidence that rapid HIV transmission is fuelled by parenteral
      exposures in health care settings, especially medical
      injections but also including transfusion of untested blood
      and others</span><sup><a href="#n9">9</a>,<a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup>. Not only are injections popular
      among African patients, administered at an estimated 90% of
      medical visits, but also often unnecessary<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup>, and injection equipment is often
      reused without sterilisation<sup><a
      href="#n22">22,23</a></sup>. Investigation of iatrogenic
      outbreaks in Russia, Romania and Libya has demonstrated both
      that medical injections are efficient vectors for HIV
      transmission and that rigorous application of safe injection
      procedures can virtually eliminate transmission<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">We are preparing a research agenda detailing
      methods to investigate further the details of the role of
      iatrogenesis in African HIV transmission. One method is to
      conduct widespread testing of 5&ndash;11 year old children
      and then test the mothers of the seropositive children,
      looking for seronegative mothers from whom extensive
      histories of their child's health care exposures would be
      obtained.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The common belief that
      90% of HIV transmission in Africa is driven by heterosexual
      exposure is no longer tenable.</span> Evidence supporting a
      much larger role for parenteral HIV transmission in medical
      settings in Africa has recently been painstakingly detailed
      <sup><a href="#n9">9</a>,<a href="#n21">21</a></sup>. The
      HSRC report, if confirmed, adds to this evidence. The lessons
      for all doctors, including obstetricians and gynaecologists
      are clear: They must educate their patients in the dangers of
      non-sterile injections and ensure that their own practice is
      beyond reproach. Patients could be shown the package of a new
      needle (or bring their own) and single-dose vials used for
      injections. Similar improvements in the sterility of
      injections in the informal sector also need to be made. We
      must protect patients from their own medical care system in
      all countries with similar epidemiological
      characteristics.</p>
