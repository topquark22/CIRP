      <p><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> To determine the seroprevalence of HIV
      and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) by age and gender among
      young people aged 14--24 years in a South African town and to
      identify risk factors for HIV infection.</p>

      <p><b>DESIGN:</b> A community-based, cross-sectional study
      was conducted on a random sample of men (n = 723) and women
      (n = 784) living in a township in the Carletonville district
      of South Africa.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> Potential demographic and behavioural risk
      factors associated with HIV were recorded by questionnaire
      and biological tests were performed on serum and urine. Data
      analysis was performed using multivariate logistic
      regression.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Among men and women the prevalence of HIV
      infection was 9.4 and 34.4%, respectively, and of positive
      HSV-2 serology was 17.0 and 53.3%, respectively. Among
      24-year-old women the prevalence of HIV was 66.7% [95%
      confidence interval (CI), 54.6--77.3%]. HSV-2 seropositivity
      was a strong independent risk factor for HIV infection with
      odds ratios of 5.3 (95% CI, 2.7--10.3) for men and 8.4 (95%
      CI, 4.9--14.2) for women. There was no independent effect of
      age at first sex or serological markers of other sexually
      transmitted infections on HIV infection.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> HIV infection among young women
      increases rapidly after the onset of sexual activity and
      reaches extremely high levels by 24 years of age. These
      findings suggest that rates of HIV transmission from men to
      women are high and that HSV-2 plays a major role in the
      spread of HIV in this population.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Thus, circumcised men were more
      likely to be HIV+. The result was not significant (the 95% CI
      straddles 1.0) and there is a substantial probability of such
      an unbalanced result even if there is no association between
      circumcision and HIV. But it certainly casts doubts on the
      theory that circumcision protects against HIV
      infection.</span></p>

      <p>"Circumcision was not common (only 10.1% of men were
      circumcised) and median (IQR) age at circumcision was 16
      years (12-19 years). No protective effect of circumcision on
      HIV prevalence was shown."</p>
