      <h2>The association between circumcision status and human
      immunodeficiency virus infection among homosexual men.</h2>

      <p>AUTHORS; Kreiss JK; Hopkins SG</p>

      <p>METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 316 HIV
      seropositive and 186 seronegative homosexual men.</p>

      <p>ABSTRACT: To evaluate whether uncircumcised status is
      correlated with acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus
      HIV, 502 homosexual men were surveyed: 85 per cent were
      circumcised. HIV infection was significantly associated with
      uncircumcised status -odds ratio OR- 2.2: 95 per cent
      confidence interval -CI- 1.2, 3.8, nonwhite race, intravenous
      drug use, sexual contact with an intravenous drug user,
      number of male partners, frequency of unprotected receptive
      anal intercourse, and with history of genital herpes, anal
      herpes, or syphilis. Uncircumcised status was significantly
      associated with older age, nonwhite race, and history of
      syphilis: it was inversely associated with intravenous drug
      use. Using logistic regression analysis, the adjusted OR for
      the association between HIV infection and uncircumcised
      status was 2.0 (95 per cent CI, 1.0 4.0. Uncircumcised
      homosexual men has 2-fold increased risk of HIV infection.
      The role of circumcision as an intervention strategy to
      reduce sexual transmission of HIV warrants consideration.</p>

      <p><i>[Comment (Ken Derifield): Other surveys emphasize the
      need for physical exam to determine circumcision status on
      all or part of the study groups due to a significant rate of
      misclassification in some self-report groups
      (questionnaires). With the small number of men in the survey
      self-reporting, the odds ratio of 2.0 could easily go to 1.0
      with an examination (or less than 1.0 reversing the concern).
      Usually any odds ratio of 1.5 to 2.0 in a small study
      population is considered chance.]</i></p>

      <p><i>[Comment (George Hill): This study only applies to
      homosexual men. Since no one knows at birth which boys will
      become homosexual men, this cannot be used as a reason to
      carry out neonatal circumcision.]</i></p>
