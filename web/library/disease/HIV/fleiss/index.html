      <p>RE: Caldwell JC. Caldwell P. The African AIDS Epidemic.
      <i>Scientific American</i> (March 1996): 62-68.</p>

      <p>To the Editor:</p>

      <p>The Caldwell's survey of the literature on the African
      AIDS Epidemic ignores several key studies. De Vincenzi and
      Mertens of the World Health Organization reviewed 23 studies
      that suggest that male circumcision may be an associative
      factor for HIV infection in Africa. They conclude that the
      methodological errors in these studies preclude any
      conclusions about the alleged efficacy of male
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>A recent study by Grosskurth, et al. of the London School
      of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that circumcision had
      no effect on HIV infection. It is instructive to note that
      the idea that male circumcision could prevent HIV infection
      was invented in 1987 by an American circumcisionist who hoped
      to influence the American debate over circumcision. The
      studies which later attempted to prove this hypothesis using
      African villagers and prostitutes as subjects are also by
      North Americans who have strong cultural and religious biases
      in favor of male circumcision. The very notion of considering
      circumcision as a factor in the first place reflects this
      bias. Australia too has had a history of infant male
      circumcision. Could the Caldwell's bias evinced by their
      exclusion of contradictory data be a reflection of this
      unfortunate history?</p>

      <p>The Caldwells seriously misrepresent the 1952 study by
      Asin. Asin did not conclude that chancroid was less prevalent
      in circumcised soldiers because they were circumcised, nor
      did he conclude that the intact penis is harder to clean.
      That 4% of the 1,402 soldiers studied (71% of whom were
      Black) were circumcised merely reflects the circumcision rate
      among adult Americans at that time. The statement that 33% of
      U.S. soldiers in Korea were intact is false and found nowhere
      in the medical literature.</p>

      <p>Researcher bias is a serious problem in any study or
      survey. In Africa, male circumcision and female circumcision
      occur in the same communities. An African or Moslem
      researcher with a bias in favor of female circumcision could
      just as easily use the maps presented by the Caldwell's to
      suggest that it is female circumcision that protects against
      HIV. Amputating parts of the reproductive organs of either
      sex will not prevent venereal infections. Only education will
      accomplish this goal.</p>

      <p>[CIRP note: Fleiss and Hodges's complete letter, as
      submitted for publication, is presented here. Serious
      deletions were made by Scientific American before this letter
      was published. The effect of these deletions, intentional or
      not, was to portray Fleiss and Hodges's conclusions as
      unsupported and ridiculous.</p>

      <p>A response from Caldwell and Caldwell was also published,
      which repeated the egregious errors of the original article.
      Of course the response failed to address Fleiss and Hodges's
      key arguments&mdash;they had been deleted!]</p>
