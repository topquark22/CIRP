      <p><b>BACKGROUND:</b> Male circumcision is associated with
      reduced HIV acquisition.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> HIV acquisition was determined in a cohort
      of 5507 HIV-negative Ugandan men, and in 187 HIV-negative men
      in discordant relationships. Transmission was determined in
      223 HIV-positive men with HIV-negative partners. HIV
      incidence per 100 person years (py) and adjusted rate ratios
      (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by
      Poisson regression. HIV-1 serum viral load was determined for
      the seropositive partners in HIV-discordant couples.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> The prevalence of circumcision was 16.5%
      for all men; 99.1% in Muslims and 3.7% in non-Muslims.
      Circumcision was significantly associated with reduced HIV
      acquisition in the cohort as a whole (RR 0.53, CI 0.33-0.87),
      but not among non-Muslim men. Prepubertal circumcision
      significantly reduced HIV acquisition (RR 0.49, CI
      0.26-0.82), but postpubertal circumcision did not. In
      discordant couples with HIV-negative men, no serconversions
      occurred in 50 circumcised men, whereas HIV acquisition was
      16.7 per 100 py in uncircumcised men (<i>P</i> = 0.004). In
      couples with HIV-positive men, HIV transmission was
      significantly reduced in circumcised men with HIV viral loads
      less than 50000 copies/ml (<i>P</i> = 0.02).</p>

      <p><b>INTERPRETATION:</b> Prepubertal circumcision may reduce
      male HIV acquisition in a general population, <span
      class="yellow">but the protective effects are confounded by
      cultural and behavioral factors in Muslims.</span> In
      discordant couples, circumcision reduces HIV acquisition and
      transmission. <span class="yellow">The assessment of
      circumcision for HIV prevention is complex and requires
      randomized trials.</span></p>

      <p class="CIRP">[CIRP Note: The statement that "circumcision
      reduces HIV acquisition and transmission" has been determined
      to be inaccurate. See <a
