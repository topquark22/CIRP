      <h2>Dry sex in Zimbabwe and implications for condom use</h2>
      <b>Civic D, Wilson D</b>

      Zimbabwe</a>.</p>

      <p>'Dry sex' refers to the preference for a dry, tight vagina
      during sexual intercourse. Women in Zimbabwe and elsewhere
      have been found to use a variety of drying agents to achieve
      these effects. Previous studies of 'dry sex' have
      concentrated on documentation of the practice and
      investigation of any associated increased risk of HIV. In
      contrast, this study examines the impact of 'dry sex' on
      condom use and effectiveness. Focus group interviews were
      held with female HIV/AIDS peer educators in Zimbabwe who had
      a history of commercial sex work. Participants reported that
      drying agents had physical and psychological consequences.
      That is, agents were said to dry and tighten a woman's
      vagina, and also to serve as 'love potions' to attract sexual
      partners and ensure their faithfulness. Although vaginal
      dryness was not found to deter the use of condoms, some women
      were reluctant to use condoms for fear of blocking the
      'magic' of drying agents. <span class="yellow">There was
      agreement among participants that condoms frequently broke
      when used in conjunction with drying agents.</span>
      Participants primarily attributed condom breakage to
      excessive vaginal tightness. Lubricants were not routinely
      used during sex or with condoms. However, participants
      preferred the use of lubricated condoms when they used
      condoms. Implications of the 'dry sex' practice for AIDS
      prevention programs and development of new HIV prevention
      technologies are discussed.</p>
