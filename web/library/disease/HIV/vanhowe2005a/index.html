          <p class="abtext1">The objective of this study was to
          determine whether the justifications given for promoting
          mass circumcision as a preventive measure for HIV
          infection are reasonable and whether mass circumcision is
          a feasible preventive measure for HIV infection in
          developing countries.</p>

          <p class="abtext2">The medical literature concerning the
          practice of circumcision in the absence of medical
          indication was reviewed regarding its impact on HIV
          infection and related issues. The literature was analysed
          with careful attention to historical perspective.</p>

          <p class="abtext2">Our results show that the medical
          literature supporting mass circumcision for the
          prevention of HIV infection is inconsistent and based on
          observation studies. Even if the two ongoing randomised
          controlled trials in Africa show a protective benefit of
          circumcision, factors such as the unknown complication
          rate of the procedure, the permanent injury to the penis,
          human rights violations and the potential for veiled
          colonialism need to be taken into account. Based on the
          best estimates, mass circumcision would not be as
          cost-effective as other interventions that have been
          demonstrated to be effective.</p>

          <p class="abtext2">Even if effective, mass circumcision
          as a preventive measure for HIV in developed countries is
          difficult to justify.</p>

          class="heading">INTRODUCTION</span><br />
           The explosion of publicity accorded to the HIV/AIDS
          pandemic can in part be attributed to the lack of clear
          understanding of the disease mechanism and the apparently
          inescapable mortality attributed to the acquisition of
          HIV. The public&rsquo;s awareness and fear of HIV have
          resulted in changes in sexual behaviours such as
          increased condom use, which has been less comprehensive
          and long-lasting than originally expected.<sup><a
          href="#n1">1</a></sup> Regrettably, some have capitalised
          on the fear generated by the HIV/AIDS pandemic to promote
          personal or political agendas.<sup><a
          href="#n2">2-5</a></sup> In the medical establishment,
          this has been manifested in the scientifically dubious
          promotion of male circumcision as a preventive measure
          for HIV infection.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>
          <br />
           

          <p class="text1"><span class="heading">HISTORY OF
          CIRCUMCISION PROMOTION</span><br />
           This is not the first time that circumcision has been
          promoted as a panacea for an incurable disease. As a
          medical procedure, circumcision was first introduced in
          the nineteenth century in English-speaking countries as a
          means of preventing and &lsquo;curing&rsquo;
          masturbation, which was then believed to cause everything
          from epilepsy, insanity, tuberculosis, spinal paralysis,
          to hip dysplasia.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> As the
          germ theory of disease developed and the understanding of
          disease processes improved, the true aetiologies of the
          illnesses for which circumcision was believed to hold the
          cure were elucidated. During the Cold War, mass
          involuntary circumcision of the newborn was implemented
          in the USA, giving the practice a cultural
          foothold.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> New
          medical-sounding justifications, however, were sought to
          justify its continued use as a routine neonatal surgery
          since the traditional justifications for preventing
          masturbation and &lsquo;nervous diseases&rsquo; were no
          longer as persuasive to the public or the medical
          profession. The prevention of cancer, sexually
          transmitted diseases (STDs) and urinary tract infections
          were each in turn invoked to justify infant male
          circumcision, although the medical evidence supporting
          such claims ranged from paltry to imaginary.</p>

          <p class="text2">A clear pattern has emerged: any
          incurable disease that happens to be the focus of
          national attention at any given time will be used by US
          circumcision advocates as an excuse for the continued
          imposition of mass circumcision. In the 1870s, epilepsy
          was the focus of national attention, so circumcision
          advocates claimed that circumcision could cure and
          prevent epilepsy.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> In the
          1940s, STDs were the focus of national attention, so
          circumcision advocates claimed that circumcision could
          cure and prevent the spread of STDs.<sup><a
          href="#n6">6</a></sup> Likewise in the 1950s, cancer was
          the focus of national attention, and again circumcision
          advocates claimed that circumcision could cure and
          prevent a variety of cancers including penile cancer,
          cancer of the tongue, prostate cancer, rectal cancer and
          cervical cancer.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> Since the
          late 1980s, HIV and AIDS have become the focus of
          national attention, and circumcision advocates have,
          predictably, claimed that circumcision can prevent HIV
          infection.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>
          <br />
           

          <p class="text1"><span class="heading">LINKING
          CIRCUMCISION AND HIV/AIDS</span><br />
           Against this historical backdrop, the HIV/AIDS pandemic
          is merely the latest incarnation of a 130-year-old
          pattern of circumcision promotion by a small, but very
          influential, portion of the medical community in
          circumcising first world countries.<sup><a
          href="#n7">7-12</a></sup> The idea that circumcision can
          prevent AIDS was developed by Fink, a long-time advocate
          of mass circumcision. Fink introduced the hypothesis in a
          letter to the <i>New England Journal of
          Medicine</i>,<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> which he
          later admitted was based purely on speculation rather
          than hard data.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> Seeking
          to capitalise on public anxiety over the spread of HIV,
          other advocates of mass circumcision sought to develop
          Fink&rsquo;s hypothesis by producing geographical
          analyses of Africa, which studied maps rather than men,
          which they argued could be used to legitimise mass
          circumcision in the US. Using decades-old anthropological
          data and extrapolating HIV incidence rates, an
          association between the foreskin and HIV was
          suggested.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> Next came a
          number of observational studies suggesting an association
          between the foreskin and an increased risk of HIV
          infection in men, mostly in Kenya, who exhibited
          high-risk behaviours.<sup><a href="#n16">16, 17</a></sup>
          These studies compared disparate populations that were
          distinguishable on other relevant independent variables,
          such as religion, social class, tribal affiliation,
          sexual practices and presence of genital ulcer disease.
          Subsequently, the degree of association of the initial
          studies and the infectivity attributed to the foreskin
          could not be replicated in the same population by the
          same team of investigators.<sup><a
          href="#n18">18</a></sup></p>

          <p class="text2">Partner studies in which associations
          were suggested between the HIV status of a woman and the
          circumcision status of her sexual partner have overall
          failed to support an association.<sup><a href="#n19">19,
          20</a></sup> Likewise, general population surveys have,
          as a whole, failed to demonstrate a strong association.
          <sup><a href="#n19">19, 20</a></sup> It is only when
          limiting the analysis to African studies and using values
          obtained following multivariate analysis that an
          association can be extracted from these studies.<sup><a
          href="#n21">21</a></sup> One of the challenges in
          interpreting these various observational studies is
          determining whether circumcision status may be a risk
          factor or a marker for other risk factors. The
          fundamental flaw in multivariate analysis is that to be
          accurate it is assumed that the variables controlled for
          are independent of one another.Many of these variables,
          including sexual, religious and hygienic practices, as
          well as economic status, appear to be linked to tribal
          affiliation, which in turn is strongly correlated with
          circumcision status.<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup>
          These multiple, highly-correlated, confounding factors
          influencing sexual behaviours and HIV susceptibility
          create a co-linearity problem that can make these
          regression models unstable and yield unreliable results.
          Consequently, without more reliable data it is
          irresponsible to place blame for HIV&rsquo;s spread on
          normal penile anatomy.</p>

          <p class="text2">Many of the studies suggesting an
          association between circumcision status and HIV infection
          tested a wide assortment of factors, fishing for
          significant risk factors without making the proper
          adjustments for multiple comparisons. As a result, many
          of the positive associations asserted could be due merely
          to oversampling. Meta-analysis has demonstrated
          significant between-study variability independent of the
          vagaries of geography, study design and
          circumcision&rsquo;s prevalence within a
          community,<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> and has
          suggested the possibility of publication bias, whereby
          studies failing to find a correlation between
          circumcision status and HIV infection are either never
          submitted for publication or are passed over by
          editors.<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> Observational
          studies, when compared to randomised controlled trials,
          have been shown to consistently overestimate odds ratios
          by 30%.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> In light of this
          unexplained heterogeneity and possible publication bias,
          any conclusion based on these observational studies
          should be viewed with scepticism.<sup><a
          href="#n24">24</a></sup></p>

          <p class="text2">On the basis of weak scientific
          evidence, many circumcision proponents have called for
          universal circumcision in Africa.<sup><a
          href="#n2">2-4</a></sup></p>

          <p class="text2">Although the next logical step in this
          scientific inquiry might be a randomised controlled
          trial, problems exist with such a project. A trial
          involving permanent amputation of a body part, the
          benefit of which is largely unproven, is fraught with
          ethical pitfalls and would not be likely to be approved
          in a developed nation. The subject would certainly need
          to be fully informed, and the potential for manipulation
          of the information provided would need to be prevented.
          Studies have already demonstrated that pro-circumcision
          propaganda can effectively influence attitudes regarding
          circumcision.<sup><a href="#n25">25-30</a></sup> Despite
          the clear ethical contraindications, two randomised
          controlled trials to determine if a relationship exists
          between HIV status and circumcision to be undertaken in
          Africa have received funding from the US National
          Institutes of Health. Both studies are markedly
          overpowered so as to find a statistically significant
          difference where a significant clinical difference may
          not exist.<sup><a href="#n31">31-33</a></sup> A report in
          the lay literature suggests that compliance following
          randomisation may pose a serious threat to the
          study&rsquo;s completion.<sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup>
          Therefore, the subsequent analysis must employ an
          intent-to-treat approach, as otherwise serious bias would
          be introduced into the results.</p>
          <br />
           

          <p class="text1"><span class="heading">FACTORS TO
          CONSIDER BEFORE RECOMMENDING A CIRCUMCISION
          PROGRAMME</span><br />
           In the unlikely event that a randomised controlled trial
          demonstrates a benefit, the decision to recommend
          universal circumcision in Africa would need to take
          several additional factors into consideration.</p>

          <p class="text2">1) How does universal circumcision
          compare in efficacy, cost and complications to other
          interventions aimed at reducing HIV infection?</p>

          <p class="text2">The aggressive diagnosis and treatment
          of STDs and various treatment modalities in the African
          context have been shown to be clinically effective and
          reasonably costeffective.<sup><a
          href="#n35">35-37</a></sup> Our preliminary calculations
          indicate that to be competitive with these proven
          interventions, even granting for the sake of argument the
          proponents&rsquo; claims for the effectiveness of
          circumcision, a circumcision would need to cost less than
          $1.52 (unpublished data). Estimates of the costs of a
          sterile circumcision in Africa, excluding the cost of
          treating any complications from the surgery are
          $15.<sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup> Surgery medically
          logical intervention for this infection. Since the spread
          of HIV infection is primarily caused by behaviour, many
          AIDS researchers believe that behavioural interventions
          hold the most hope in the long term.<sup><a
          href="#n39">39</a></sup></p>

          <p class="text2">2) The surgical complications of the
          procedure, which are believed to be higher in developing
          nations, need to be considered. Although no study has
          been completed to address this issue comprehensively,
          circumcision in developing nations entails additional
          risks of tuberculosis,<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup>
          tetanus,<sup><a href="#n41">41, 42</a></sup> and severe
          complications.<sup><a href="#n43">43, 44</a></sup>
          Immediate complications following neonatal circumcision
          in North America occur in 2% to 6% of infants,<sup><a
          href="#n45">45, 46</a></sup> while delayed complications,
          such as meatal stenosis requiring meatotomy, occur in 5%
          to 10% of circumcised boys.<sup><a
          href="#n47">47</a></sup></p>

          <p class="text2">The US pro-circumcision information
          campaigns targeted at Africa are beginning to increase
          the number of requests for the procedure from African men
          who have been understandably misled into believing that
          it will make them immune to HIV infection.<sup><a
          href="#n25">25-31</a></sup> If this pattern continues,
          the demand for circumcision may outstrip the capacity to
          provide the procedure in a controlled setting.
          Non-sterile procedures performed by untrained
          individuals, who would undercut the price of sterile
          procedures, would result in a higher rate of
          complications and perhaps a higher rate of HIV infection.
          Ironically, a higher number of boys in Africa could then
          die at the hands of their circumciser than the total that
          ostensibly might have been protected from HIV
          infection.Without better information regarding
          complications, a recommendation for universal
          circumcision is unfounded.</p>

          <p class="text2">3) The permanent untoward effects of the
          amputation have been largely ignored. Circumcision
          removes the vast majority of fine-touch neuroreceptors
          found on the penis. Studies of the foreskin have revealed
          it to contain highly complex, specialised tissue.<sup><a
          href="#n48">48</a></sup> By contrast, the glans has
          primarily free nerve endings, which can only sense deep
          pressure and pain.<sup><a href="#n49">49</a></sup> The
          anatomical changes caused by circumcision may be
          responsible for the differing sexual practices seen in
          circumcised men,<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> as well
          as for coital techniques that make the experience less
          satisfactory for their female partners. <sup><a
          href="#n50">50</a></sup> Those touting the benefits of
          the amputation of the foreskin appear universally unaware
          or unwilling to acknowledge its immunological, protective
          and erogenous functions. This is to be explained by the
          fact that circumcision advocates are almost always
          circumcised men from circumcising cultures.<sup><a
          href="#n51">51</a></sup></p>

          <p class="text2">4) Careful scrutiny must be given to
          legal, ethical and human rights considerations
          surrounding the removal of healthy tissue from
          non-consenting minors to allegedly protect them from a
          behaviourbased disease that may not exist or for which
          they may not be at risk when they reach sexual
          maturity.<sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup></p>

          <p class="text2">5) The potential for bias in the
          information transmitted during the informed consent
          process in older males has been established.<sup><a
          href="#n26">26</a></sup> Using a selective bibliography,
          a convincing argument can be made in favour of
          circumcision.<sup><a href="#n53">53</a></sup> Such an
          approach may be attractive to a healthcare provider or
          investigator wishing to promote the practice. Clearly,
          such coercion - with amputation taking the place of
          education - is not in the best interests of the patient.
          The public may be left, whether intended or not, with the
          impression that circumcision provides complete protection
          from HIV infection. An increase in high-risk behaviours
          might ensue. Following circumcision, a male still needs
          to engage in safe sexual practices to avoid acquisition
          of HIV. This needs to be emphasised, and statements that
          circumcision provides a &lsquo;natural
          condom&rsquo;<sup><a href="#n54">54</a></sup> are
          counter-productive.</p>

          <p class="text2">6) It is likely that a recommendation
          for universal circumcision in Africa would be interpreted
          as thinly-veiled colonialism. In addition to raising
          human rights issues, such a call for circumcision would
          come into conflict with the role of circumcision status
          as a sign of tribal affiliation. Assimilation is probably
          the greatest threat to tribal/cultural identity.
          Imposition of circumcision on cultures where it has not
          been previously practised thus poses a serious threat to
          tribal/cultural identity. Should healthy body parts be
          amputated to conform to the cultural and religious
          practices of scientists from outside cultures whose only
          rationale is they believe that it may confer some
          benefit? Attempts to change cultural practices are often
          unwelcome and strenuously resisted. Every attempt should
          be made to counter the AIDS epidemic within the cultural
          context of those targeted. Therefore, cultures that
          currently do not circumcise should not be induced to
          adopt the practice.<sup><a href="#n55">55</a></sup></p>

          <p class="text2">7) The removal of the majority of the
          male genital mucosa would diminish the effectiveness of
          the mucosal vaccines being developed.</p>

          <p class="text2">8) The demand for male circumcision may
          translate into an increased demand for female
          circumcision, since the justifications for both practices
          are strikingly similar.<sup><a
          href="#n56">56</a></sup></p>
          <br />
           

          <p class="text1"><span class="heading">LACK OF BIOLOGICAL
          PLAUSABILITY</span><br />
           In order for the scientific community and the public to
          accept circumcision as a preventive measure for HIV, a
          biological basis for the intervention is needed.
          Circumcision proponents have responded by propagating
          speculations as if they were fact in the apparent hope
          that, if repeated often enough, they will be regarded as
          fact. Such assertions include:</p>

          <p class="text2">a) The claim that the preputial mucosa
          is more prone to abrasion than the externalised mucosa of
          the glans of the circumcised penis.<sup><a
          href="#n57">57</a></sup> In fact, a study by a prominent
          circumcision proponent found a trend in the opposite
          direction.<sup><a href="#n58">58</a></sup> In a similar
          vein, women reported more problems with adequate coital
          lubrication with their circumcised partners than with
          their genitally intact partners.<sup><a
          href="#n50">50</a></sup> Regrettably, the impact of
          &lsquo;dry sex&rsquo; on the risk of HIV in the male
          partner has been largely unexplored. <sup><a
          href="#n59">59</a></sup></p>

          <p class="text2">b) The suggestion that the subpreputial
          space is more likely to harbour sexually transmitted
          viruses and to promote their propagation.<sup><a
          href="#n57">57</a></sup> Recent studies have shown that
          genital warts are more common in the circumcised
          male.<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup> When the studies
          exploring the association between circumcision status and
          human papilloma virus infections are combined in a
          meta-analysis, the summary effect indicates no
          association (random effects model OR=1.24, 95%=0.91-1.69)
          (unpublished data). Likewise, a large American study
          found circumcised men to be at higher risk for genital
          herpes,22 while meta-analysis fails to support an
          association (random effects model OR=1.15, 95%=0.92-1.45)
          (unpublished data).</p>

          <p class="text2">c) The assertion that the preputial
          mucosa is rich in Langerhans cells, which are believed to
          be the port of entry for HIV. This assertion is based
          primarily on an opinion piece published by vocal
          advocates of mass circumcision.<sup><a
          href="#n4">4</a></sup> What is needed to decide this to
          date undocumented assertion, is data on the density of
          Langerhans cells in the prepuce of sexually active men
          with and without STDs. Such information, which would
          facilitate a determination of the importance of this
          factor, has not been published.<sup><a
          href="#n61">61</a></sup> Moreover, inflammatory T-cells
          may be needed for HIV to enter a Langerhans cell,
          suggesting that a predisposing infection may be a
          necessary condition for HIV infection.<sup><a
          href="#n62">62</a></sup> Clearly, further study is
          needed.</p>
          <br />
           

          <p class="text1"><span class="heading">IMPACT ON NORTH
          AMERICA</span><br />
           Circumcision advocates appear unduly hasty in their
          desire to implement universal circumcision in Africa,
          despite weak support for their endorsement and the
          significant number of unanswered issues. We contend that
          the rush to intervene has little to do with preventing
          HIV infection in Africa and may have more to do with a
          conscious and/or unconscious impulse to help perpetuate
          and promote the practice in North America. There is ample
          indirect evidence to support this contention.</p>

          <p class="text2">1) The call for universal circumcision
          in Africa did not emanate from Africa, but rather from
          North American physicians and researchers, most of whom
          had a long history of vocal advocacy of mass circumcision
          in the US.<sup><a href="#n2">2, 3</a>, <a
          href="#n57">57</a></sup></p>

          <p class="text2">2) A large amount of coverage in the
          North American lay press has been devoted to the studies
          suggesting an association between the foreskin and HIV
          infection among males in Africa, despite clear
          concessions that the African experience differs in a
          number of significant ways from the American
          experience.<sup><a href="#n63">63</a></sup> The American
          experience, as far as can be determined, in certain
          respects has been the opposite of that in Africa, with
          homosexual men, rather than heterosexual women, as the
          focus of the early pandemic. None of the published
          studies in the US has been able to demonstrate a clear
          association among heterosexuals between HIV and presence
          of the foreskin.<sup><a href="#n22">22</a>, <a
          href="#n64">64, 65</a></sup> One study found a marginally
          significant association in homosexual men.<sup><a
          href="#n66">66</a></sup> These results are suspect in
          that the investigators relied on history, which is known
          to be unreliable, to determine circumcision status.
          Geographic analysis of developed nations demonstrates
          that circumcision is associated with higher rates of HIV
          infection.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> This result is
          driven by the US where the incidence of
          heterosexually-acquired HIV infection is double to triple
          that documented in western Europe.<sup><a
          href="#n67">67</a></sup> Other differences between North
          America and Africa include the predominant HIV strain and
          the principal sexual mixing patterns.</p>
          Another example is the attention paid to a randomised
          controlled trial that was rejected by <i>The Lancet</i>.
          The reports of the results of this study have appeared in
          <i>Science</i><sup><a href="#n68">68</a></sup> and <i>The
          Wall Street Journal</i>,<sup><a href="#n69">69</a></sup>
          but has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.
          At the Third International AIDS Society Conference on HIV
          Pathogenesis and Treatment in Rio de Janeiro in July
          2005, a study indicating that female circumcision was
          associated with a lower risk of HIV infection was
          presented,<sup><a href="#n70">70</a></sup> yet this
          finding has received little or no attention. If the true
          aim is to reduce the incidence of HIV infection, one
          would expect physicians advocating a surgical preventive
          for males would also expend the same energy advocating a
          surgical preventive for females.<br />
          <br />
           

          <p class="text2">3) Several opinion pieces published in
          the medical literature have been portrayed as
          &lsquo;studies&rsquo; in both lay and medical
          publications. <sup><a href="#n2">2-4</a></sup> The
          authors have made no noticeable attempts to correct this
          mischaracterisation. This suggests that these authors are
          playing to the general public, especially in North
          America, in the manner most advantageous to their agenda,
          and dispensing with their obligation to avoid
          misrepresenting the importance and validity of their
          opinions.</p>

          <p class="text2">4) The neonatal circumcision juggernaut
          in the US is beginning to lose steam. Despite efforts to
          halt and reverse the decline,<sup><a
          href="#n71">71-77</a></sup> neonatal circumcision rates
          continue to fall in the US. In 1996, the Canadian
          Paediatric Society issued a policy statement that
          recommended against neonatal circumcision.<sup><a
          href="#n78">78</a></sup> More recently, the Royal
          Australasian College of Physicians, as well as provincial
          paediatric organisations in British Columbia and
          Saskatchewan, have issued policy statements strongly
          condemning neonatal circumcision.<sup><a
          href="#n79">79-82</a></sup> In 1999, the American Academy
          of Pediatrics (AAP) Task Force on Circumcision concluded
          that the medical evidence favouring circumcision was
          &lsquo;not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal
          circumcision&rsquo;.<sup><a href="#n">83</a></sup> In
          response to this policy statement published in a journal
          read primarily by North American paediatricians, three
          leading circumcision advocates were allowed to publish a
          long opinion piece recounting the many supposed medical
          benefits of neonatal circumcision.<sup><a
          href="#n5">5</a></sup> Despite one author&rsquo;s
          previous admission that studies of HIV in Africa did not
          pertain to North America,<sup><a href="#n63">63</a></sup>
          the authors provided a selective recounting of the
          studies from Africa to suggest an association between the
          foreskin and HIV infection in the US.<sup><a
          href="#n5">5</a></sup> The authors&rsquo; assertions were
          publicly dismissed by the chairman of the AAP Task Force,
          prompting an additional letter to the editor by this
          trio, who cited new publications to support their
          position.<sup><a href="#n84">84</a></sup> Two of these
          publications were, in fact, opinion pieces.<sup><a
          href="#n2">2</a>, <a href="#n85">85</a></sup> The two
          genuine studies referenced had serious methodological
          flaws and were written by a member of this trio,<sup><a
          href="#n86">86, 87</a></sup> calling their objectivity
          into question. Several years later, the lead author had
          yet another letter published in the same journal pushing
          the same message, i.e., that mass circumcision was
          necessary in the US to fight AIDS.<sup><a
          href="#n88">88</a></sup><br />
          </p>

          <p class="text1"><span
          class="heading">CONCLUSION</span><br />
           Why are circumcision proponents expending so much time
          and energy promoting mass circumcision to North Americans
          when their supposed aim is to prevent HIV in Africa? The
          circumcision rate is declining in the US, especially on
          the west coast;<sup><a href="#n89">89</a></sup> the two
          North American national paediatric organisations have
          elected not to endorse the practice, and the
          practice&rsquo;s legality has been questioned in both the
          medical and legal literature.<sup><a href="#n50">50</a>,
          <a href="#n90">90-94</a></sup> &lsquo;Playing the HIV
          card&rsquo; misdirects the fear understandably generated
          in North Americans by the HIV/AIDS pandemic into a
          concrete action: the perpetuation of the outdated
          practice of neonatal circumcision.</p>

          <p class="text2">Amputation of highly erogenous genital
          tissue is viewed as barbaric by cultures that do not
          subscribe to the practice.<sup><a
          href="#n95">95</a></sup> From a psychological standpoint,
          it can be inferred that, in cultures where circumcision
          is common, circumcisers desire to be empowered by their
          actions. Similarly, circumcised males are conditioned to
          believe that their incomplete penis is superior to the
          intact penis. Medical justifications, even though
          repeatedly proposed and disproven,<sup><a
          href="#n6">6</a></sup> are a means by which these
          psychological objectives can be accomplished.</p>

          <p class="text2">In the quest to conquer AIDS, as with
          any disease, medicine and science ought to be purged of
          all vestiges of superstition, personal agendas and
          wishful thinking. Medicine must ally itself with
          scientifically proven practices within the dictates of
          medical ethics, human rights and the law. Beliefs and
          fears alone, no matter how understandable, deeply held or
          traditional, cannot justify the amputation of healthy
          tissue. Scientific efforts to understand, contain and
          prevent HIV infection are more likely to be successful
          when the scientists involved in this endeavor can gather
          and analyse data objectively and rationally rather than
          use AIDS as yet another excuse to promote an old blood
          rite.</p>
