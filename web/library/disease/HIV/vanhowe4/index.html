      <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

      <p class="text1">In the late 1980s, several small studies
      conducted in Africa suggested an association between having a
      foreskin and a greater risk of contracting human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Some of these studies based
      their conclusion by looking at maps, some looked at high-risk
      populations, and others looked at patrons of sexually
      transmitted disease (STD) clinics. Recently, however, several
      large random population surveys performed in Africa have
      found that circumcised men are more likely to be HIV
      infected. Despite inconsistent findings in the medical
      literature, there is a misconception that the foreskin places
      a man at greater risk for acquiring an HIV infection<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> Thirty-five studies have been
      published in peer-reviewed journals that have addressed what
      role, if any, the prepuce plays in the transmission of HIV.
      Available data from these studies have been combined in a
      meta-analysis. Looking at the corpus of scientific literature
      concerning the relation of the prepuce with HIV may be
      helpful in developing recommendations for HIV prevention.</p>

      <p><b>GEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Three studies have linked the foreskin to
      HIV infection by looking at maps, instead of men. These
      studies found an association between the practice of male
      circumcision at a societal level and regional HIV
      seroprevalence in Africa. In locations where male
      circumcision is practiced, HIV seroprevalence was found to be
      considerably lower than in areas where it is not
      practiced<sup><a href="#n2">2-4</a></sup>. Other cultural
      factors, such as age at first coitus, chastity and monogamy,
      that could otherwise explain the differences were not
      considered by the authors. The authors employed data
      collected in the 1950s concerning circumcision practices.
      They assumed that circumcision practices had not changed
      since that time and that, within a given area, circumcision
      was universal or completely absent. Circumcision was not a
      panacea in preventing the spread of HIV as several areas
      where circumcision was practiced also demonstrated high
      levels of HIV seroprevalence.</p>

      <p class="text2">In all of these studies, the presence of
      other STDs and other risk factors were not taken into
      account. In addition, the indices of HIV prevalence were very
      crude, as were the data on which the circumcision rates were
      based.</p>

      <p class="text2">Applying the same methodology used in these
      studies to first world countries produces the opposite
      result. If the World Health Organization data from 1995 for
      AIDS prevalence<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> are plotted
      against estimated circumcision rates (Table 1) and the data
      points are weighted for population, a positive correlation
      (Figures 1 and 2) is found between circumcision and AIDS
      prevalence (slope=14.95, 95% CI=13.19-16.71,
      R<sup>2</sup>=0.69) in first world countries<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">As with the previous map studies, this
      analysis ignores a number of important risk factors including
      cultural sexual practices. The results illustrate the
      inaccuracy and lack of power associated with this type of
      investigation.</p>

      <h3>PATIENT STUDIES</h3>

      <p class="text1">Most of the studies published have involved
      case-controlled studies or random population surveys, a
      summary of which can be seen in Table 2.</p>

      <h4>High Risk patients</h4>

      <p class="text1">Investigators have assessed high-risk
      patients by studying long-distance truck drivers, female sex
      workers, STD clinics, and tuberculosis patients.</p>

      <p class="text2">Three studies looked at truck drivers who
      frequented the services of HIV-infected female sex
      workers<sup><a href="#n7">7-9</a></sup>. All showed a
      significant association between the presence of a foreskin
      and a greater risk for HIV infection.</p>

      <p class="text2">Most of the positive studies from Africa
      have been performed at STD clinics<sup><a
      href="#n10">10-17</a></sup>, and have yielded mixed results.
      When comparing data collected by the same investigational
      group, findings to the degree described by Cameron <i>et
      al.</i><sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup>, that men with
      foreskins were more likely to be HIV infected and more likely
      to acquire an HIV infection if not already infected could not
      be replicated in the study by Nassio <i>et al.</i><sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup>, even though the Nassio study
      involved twice as many patients.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="fig1.gif" alt="Figure 1" /> 

        <p><i>Figure 1. Circumcision status and AIDS
        prevalence</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">What consistently
      appears throughout all of these studies is the strong
      correlation between genital ulcer disease and HIV infection.
      There is also a correlation between genital ulcer disease and
      the foreskin in many of the studies. However, when
      multivariate analysis was performed on several of the
      studies, the foreskin as a factor was no longer
      significant<sup><a href="#n12">12,13</a></sup>, suggesting
      that the genital ulcer disease rather than the foreskin
      facilitated the transmission of HIV.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Despite receiving a lot of attention
      following its publication in <i>The Lancet</i>, several
      methodological limitations are present in Cameron's analysis.
      For example, a selection bias may have resulted from a
      disproportionate number of circumcised men being lost to
      follow-up<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup>. A substantial
      proportion of seroconversions may have been missed by
      including patients with only 2 weeks of follow-up<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup>. If the proportion of missed
      seroconversions differed between circumcised and
      non-circumcised men, further bias may have been
      introduced.</p>

      <p class="text2">In STD clinic studies conducted in the
      United States, there have been two abstracts and 2 studies
      published. The results have been mixed. While one abstract
      found an association between the foreskin and HIV
      infection<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup>, the other did
      not.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> Similarly, the studies
      published in peer-reviewed journals included one study that
      showed no significance<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup>, and
      one that did.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> In the one that
      did, the investigators relied on patient report to determine
      circumcision status. While the authors felt that it was
      unlikely that substantial misclassification occurred,
      reported positive predictive values of a male stating his
      penis is circumcised have been 35.5%<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup>, 41.5%<sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup>, and 69.4%<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup>. If the 41.5 positive predictive
      value is applied to this patient population, the correlation
      becomes smaller and non-significant (OR=1.15, 95%
      CI=0.79-1.68). Compared to the other risk factors studied,
      the foreskin was a minor player.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="fig2.gif" alt="Figure 2" /> 

        <p><i>Figure 2. Correlation between AIDS and
        circumcision</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">The two studies from STD clinics in India
      both found that the foreskin was associated with HIV
      infection<sup><a href="#n27">27,28</a></sup>, but the
      differences were non-significant in one study<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">A study population and controls derived from
      the clientele of STD clinics do not reflect the population as
      a whole and introduce a population bias that may be in part
      responsible for the results seen. To generalize the results
      of studies conducted in STD clinics, one must assume that
      circumcised and non-circumcised men use these health
      facilities in the same manner. This, however, is not the case
      as socioeconomic and cultural factors often differ between
      the two groups. It is possible that circumcised men exhibit
      different health-seeking behaviour than non-circumcised men.
      If, for example, circumcised men are more likely to seek care
      for minor genital symptoms, they would be over-represented in
      the control population. This would cause the association
      between the foreskin and various STDs including HIV infection
      to be overestimated, if not spuriously generated<sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">In a study in Abidjan, C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire,
      of men diagnosed with tuberculosis, lack of circumcision was
      found to be a significant risk factor<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup>.</p>

      <h4>Partner Studies</h4>

      <p class="text1">Partner Studies were performed to see if any
      attributes of HIV-infected women were contributing
      factors<sup><a href="#n31">31-36</a></sup>. Most failed to
      show the foreskin to be a significant factor (Table 2).</p>

      <h4>Random population surveys</h4>

      <p class="text1">The most reliable study design is the random
      population survey. Several of these have been performed in
      Africa,<sup><a href="#n26">26</a>,<a
      href="#n37">37-46</a></sup> with several of the studies
      demonstrating the circumcised male to be at greater risk for
      HIV infection (Table 2).</p>

      <h3>META-ANALYSIS</h3>

      <p class="text1">In an attempt to put these conflicting data
      into perspective, a meta-analysis was performed. Data was
      taken from all of the studies published in peer-reviewed
      medical journals. Two published studies provided their
      conclusions without providing data. One study found no
      significant association<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup>, one
      did<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>. Two of the included
      studies equated being Muslim with being circumcised<sup><a
      href="#n44">44,45</a></sup>, although religious preference in
      Africa does not always correlate with circumcision
      status<sup><a href="#n7">7</a>,<a href="#n43">43</a></sup>.
      Another equated the presence of a long residual foreskin,
      following circumcision, with not being circumcised<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup>. Although these may be erroneous
      assumptions, the inclusion or exclusion of these studies did
      not affect the overall outcome. The data are presented in
      Table 2. The combined data from the studies looking at
      high-risk populations found non-circumcised males to be at
      greater risk (OR=1.18, 95% CI=1.26-1.59), but only 11.7% of
      HIV infections could be attributed to the presence of the
      foreskin. Combining the partner study data yielded similar
      results (OR=1.42, 95% CI=1.26-1.59), while combining the
      random population surveys found non-circumcised men to be at
      significantly lower risk of acquisition or transmission of
      HIV (OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.77-0.97). When the raw numbers are
      accumlated from all of the published studies, having a
      foreskin significantly decreases the risk of acquisition or
      transmission of HIV (OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.89-0.99), although the
      impact is small. The weakness of applying the raw numbers in
      such a fashion are that the studies with large numbers
      dominate, and confounding factors cannot be accurately
      accounted for.</p>

      <p class="text2">When studies are grouped based on the
      prevalence of circumcision in the community (excluding those
      studies using religion or degree of circumcision as a
      substitute for circumcision status), non-circumcised men were
      more likely to contract HIV if they were in the minority
      (OR=3.06, 95% CI=2.72-3.46). However, if non-circumcised men
      were in the majority, the presence of the foreskin was not a
      risk factor (OR=1.01, 95% CI=0.93-1.11). Minority groups are
      often at higher risk for disease because of economic
      disadvantages and increased exposure. this result reflects
      this well recognized trend.</p>

      <h3>ASSESSMENT OF CAUSATION</h3>

      <p class="text1">A casual relationship cannot be inferred
      from retrospective studies. To determine the likelihood of
      causality, Hill developed a number of criteria, which, if
      met, make a causal relationship more likely. Before
      intervention can be deemed warranted, it is important to
      determine whether the epidemiological data meet Hill's
      criteria<sup><a href="#n47">47</a></sup> for causality.</p>

      <h4>Strength</h4>

      <p class="text1">The relationship between the presence of a
      foreskin and HIV infection is strong is some studies, but the
      exact opposite in other studies. The design of the study is
      paramount, as non-causal associations can easily arise in
      observational studies due to confounding and
      misclassification<sup><a href="#n48">48,49</a></sup>. The
      least reliable design study is the population-based random
      cluster sample survey. The difference in outcomes based on
      study design are shown in figure 3. Of the studies with most
      reliable study design, most found circumcised men to be at
      greater risk for HIV infection.</p>

      <h4>Consistency</h4>

      <p class="text1">The results of the studies have varied
      markedly based on study design, time of study, and study
      location. Even utilizing similar designs has yielded
      discordant results. This strongly suggests that other factors
      associated with the foreskin, rather than the foreskin
      itself, are responsible for the acquisition and spead of
      HIV.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="fig3.gif" alt="Figure 3" />
      </center>

      <h4>Specificity</h4>

      <p class="text1">The multiple identified factors associated
      with the acquisition and transmission of HIV make it
      impossible to single out the foreskin as a significant
      factor. In numerous studies, the significance of circumcision
      status is altered when other factors are controlled for.</p>

      <h4>Temporality</h4>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision usually takes place before
      sexual activity is initiated. Only one study examined the
      timing of circumcision and its effect on HIV infection. When
      compared with men who were never circumcised, those
      circumcised after 15 years of age had a lower HIV prevalence
      (OR=0.48, 95% CI=0.25-0.90), while those circumcised before
      15 years of age had a greater HIV prevalence (O=1.34, 95%
      CI=0.64-3.00)<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup>. No explanation
      for this finding is given.</p>

      <h4>Biologic gradient</h4>

      <p class="text1">This involves demonstration of a dose-effect
      relationship. Only one study has looked at the degree of
      circumcision. In that single study, men with more residual
      skin were at greater risk of HIV-2 infection<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup>. It is impossible to reach any
      conclusions based on that single study.</p>

      <h4>Biologic plausibility</h4>

      <p class="text1">Moses <i>et al.</i> have suggested the
      following: (1) that minor inflammatory conditions occur
      underneath the foreskin resulting in mucosal discontinuity
      providing a portal of entry for HIV; (2) that the foreskin
      may be more susceptible to minor trauma during intercourse;
      (3) that the warm, moist environment under the foreskin
      provides an environment conducive to prolonged viral
      survival; and (4) that Langerhans cells, plentiful in the
      foreskin of male macaque monkeys, are highly susceptible to
      simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)<sup><a
      href="#n50">50</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">While it has long been postulated that the
      warm, moist environment under the prepuce is a breeding
      ground for pathogens, the immunological protection provided
      by sub-preputial flora<sup><a href="#n51">51</a></sup>,
      secretory immunoglobulins, and lytic secretions from the
      prostate, urethra, and seminal vesicles<sup><a
      href="#n52">52</a></sup> has not been adequately
      investigated, and may explain why American men with foreskins
      are less likely to have genital herpes<sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup> and genital warts<sup><a
      href="#n54">54</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">The role of Langerhans cells is confusing.
      These cells initiate the immune response to infectious
      agents. While they are present in the prepuce of monkeys and
      adult males, Weiss <i>et al.</i> were not able to demonstrate
      their presence on the inner surface of the prepuce in tissue
      taken from the newborn penis<sup><a href="#n55">55</a></sup>.
      Histological examination of the prepuce of older males has
      demonstrated Langerhans cells in the mucosa<sup><a
      href="#n56">56</a></sup>. The physiological fusion of the
      preputial and glans mucosa and the sterile intrauterine
      environment may explain their absence in the newborn.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the primate study referenced by Moses et
      al. it was Langerhans-like cells in the lamina propria, and
      not the epithelium that appeared to be infected with
      SIV<sup><a href="#n57">57</a></sup>. It is unclear whether
      this observation can be extrapolated to the Langerhans cells
      in the epithelium of the prepuce in humans. More research is
      needed.</p>

      <p class="text2">Beaug&eacute; suggests that the loss of the
      penile skin from circumcision can result in the skin being
      tight over the penis when erect. This tight skin increases
      the friction during intercourse and increases the likelihood
      of abrasions through which a virus can be introduced
      systemically. This may make the circumcised penis more likely
      to contract HIV<sup><a href="#n58">58</a></sup> The increased
      likelihood of circumcised men engaging in active anal
      sex<sup><a href="#n53">53</a></sup> may make the circumcised
      penis more likely to contract HIV infection.</p>

      <p class="text2">Both theories evolve around skin and mucosal
      integrity. The presence of genital ulcers has been repeatedly
      demonstrated to be a more important factor than circumcision
      status.</p>

      <h4>Coherence</h4>

      <p class="text1">The theory should fit in with other known
      characteristics of the illness. For example, in some cultures
      circumcision was once part of the coming of age ritual during
      which the boy is taught how to relate to women and how to
      maintain discipline in sexual matters. This teaching may have
      helped reduce high risk behaviours. Now the teaching has
      disappeared<sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup>. Instead, as a
      proof of manhood, sexual intercourse often follows soon after
      circumcision. This often takes place in the commercial sex
      market with a circumcision wound that has not completely
      healed<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup>. Circumcision once fit
      a coherent social pattern of restraint and has been replaced
      with high risk behaviour. Currently in Africa, circumcised
      men may have more sexual partners<sup><a
      href="#n17">17,26</a></sup> and are less likely to be
      currently married (OR=0.7, 95% CI=0.5-0.9)<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">Tyndall <i>et al.</i> reported that the
      number of sexual partners and sexual exposure to female sex
      workers were not risk factors for HIV infection. The authors
      indict the foreskin as the culprit for HIV infection<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup>. These findings are counterintuitive
      and contradict the corpus of the medical literature. An
      alternative explanation exists. The study only looked at men
      with genital ulcers. In men who present with an STD,
      circumcised men are more likely to present with a genital
      discharge while non-circumcised men are more likely present
      with genital ulcerations. The most common cause of
      ulcerations in Africa is chancroid. While chancroid has never
      been shown to be more common in non-circumcised men, it has a
      very high prevalence among certain ethnic groups that are
      usually economically depressed minorities<sup><a
      href="#n61">61</a></sup>. The <i>National Health and Social
      Life Survey</i> published by investigators from the
      University of Chicago documented that sexual partners are not
      found randomly but from within one's social network, which is
      constrained by race, religion, ehnicity, and socioeconomic
      status. Additionally, they confirm that an STD with a high
      transmission rate will often spead very quickly and attain a
      higher prevalence rate within a smaller social network<sup><a
      href="#n62">62</a></sup> The decision by Tyndall <i>et
      al.</i> to implement their study design with a population
      where the minority of men were non-circumcised virtually
      guaranteed that non-circumcised men would be at higher risk
      for HIV infection. With a high infectivity rate, one could
      easily anticipate that chancroid, a highly contagious risk
      factor for HIV infection, could reach a higher prevalence in
      a minority non-circumcised population. Being a member of this
      portion of the population, not the foreskin, could be enough
      to negate known risk factors for HIV infection.</p>

      <h4>Experimental evidence</h4>

      <p class="text1">There is none.</p>

      <h4>Analogy</h4>

      <p class="text1">Is there another illness to which the
      foreskin makes a man more susceptible? Can it be equated with
      the acquisition and transmission of HIV? The analogy of STDs
      has been used in the past, but recent studies have cast
      serious doubt on whether the foreskin is a factor in
      STDs<sup><a href="#n53">53,54,63-65</a></sup>. Urinary tract
      infections in infancy may be associated with foreskin, but
      demonstrating how they would be analogous to HIV infection
      would be difficult.</p>

      <p>Based on the above criteria, a causal relation between the
      foreskin and HIV infection cannot be demonstrated.</p>

      <h3>DISCUSSION</h3>

      <p class="text1">The quantification of a potential benefit,
      if any, that could be expected from male circumcision as
      protection from HIV transmission is highly problematic.
      Inconsistent study results coupled with the results of the
      meta-analysis emphasize this. While meta-analysis is an
      inexact tool<sup><a href="#n66">66</a></sup>, it may help
      place the impact of small studies in perspective.
      Interestingly, the combined data from the high-risk
      populations yielded a lower odds ratio than any of the
      studies of that type. The lack of parity of circumcision
      status in the individual studies and the wide variation in
      HIV prevalence can help to explain this finding. By combining
      the data, the number of circumcised subjects is closer in
      number to those not circumcised than in any of the individual
      studies. Whether this makes the comparison more valid is
      debatable.</p>

      <p class="text2">Another weakness of the meta-analysis is the
      inability to correct for confounding factors, the most
      important of which is the presence of genital ulcers. It is
      also difficult to incorporate studies of varying design.
      Recent studies, in which the raw numbers suggest circumcised
      men to be at greater risk for HIV infection have found that
      circumcised men have more sexual partners<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a>,<a href="#n26">26</a></sup>. When
      corrected for number of partners, the foreskin was found to
      increase the likelihood of HIV infection. Based on the recent
      findings that circumcision significantly alters sexual
      activity in adult males<sup><a href="#n53">53</a></sup>, it
      may be inadvisable to look at these factors separately. It is
      likely that circumcision may be responsible for the increased
      number of partners and therefore the increased risk.</p>

      <p class="text2">The recommendation to routinely circumcise
      boys in Africa is unfounded and even dangerous. In some parts
      of Africa, circumcision is a leading cause of tetanus (59.4%
      of cases)<sup><a href="#n67">67</a></sup>. The use of dirty
      instruments and mass ritual events, including group
      circumcision, may increase the number of young boys
      developing HIV infections<sup><a href="#n68">68</a></sup> The
      risk of spreading tuberculosis through circumcision in
      developing countries is also a valid concern<sup><a
      href="#n69">69</a></sup>. Severe complications and death are
      not uncommon following ritual circumcision<sup><a
      href="#n70">70,</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">If one assumes that circumcision does not
      prevent some cases of HIV infection, what impact would
      universal circumcision have? Using the data provided by Seed
      <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup>, the relative
      risk of developing HIV infection is 1.37 times greater in the
      male with a foreskin, and 27% of HIV cases might be
      attributed to this factor. With an AIDS prevalence in the
      United States of 16 per 100,000<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>
      and an attributable risk of 27%, it would take 23,148
      circumcisions to prevent one case of AIDS. In Australia and
      the UK, it would take 82,304 and 154,320 circumcisions
      respectively to prevent one case of AIDS. One could expect
      46, 165, and 308 life-threatening complications in the US,
      Australia, and UK respectively, for each case of AIDS
      prevented<sup><a href="#n72">72</a></sup>. In a developing
      country, the risks of tetanus, tuberculosis, infection,
      exsanguination, amputation, and death from circumcision would
      outweigh the benefit of preventing a small number of HIV
      infections.</p>

      <p class="text2">The large discrepancies between the studies
      suggest that the foreskin is not a significant factor. Faced
      with a similar discrepancy between gonorrhoea as a risk
      factor for HIV infection in different geographical regions,
      Weir <i>et al.</i> concluded that gonorrhoeal infection did
      not facilitate HIV acquisition, but that having gonorrhoea
      acted as a marker for unprotected intercourse that
      facilitated HIV acquisition<sup><a href="#n73">73</a></sup>.
      In similar fashion, the foreskin may be acting as a marker
      for other more relevant factors.</p>

      <p class="text2">For example, there may exist a causal
      relation between several STDs and HIV infection<sup><a
      href="#n74">74,75</a></sup>, resulting from the mutual
      dependence of HIV and STDs on patterns of sexual activity or
      from the effect HIV may have on the clinical course of the
      STD. Likewise, the differing role of the prepuce as a risk
      factor, depending on the prevalence of circumcision in a
      region, suggests that the prepuce is a marker of the lack of
      socioeconomic and political privilege that factors heavily in
      the transmission and treatment of infectious diseases. The
      design of the study is paramount as non-causal associations
      can easily arise in observational studies due to confounding
      and misclassification<sup><a href="#n48">48,49</a></sup>.
      Unfortunately with circumcision, interventional trials are
      not feasible to measure the effect of this variable. Until
      this interaction between STDs and HIV is understood and
      controlled for, the role of the prepuce cannot be adequately
      delineated.</p>

      <p class="text2">Based on the studies published in the
      scientific literature, it is incorrect to assert that
      circumcision prevents HIV infection. Even if studies showing
      circumcision to be beneficial are accurate, the risk from
      circumcision outweighs any small benefit it may have. To
      depend on circumcision to protect against HIV infection in
      lieu of condoms, which have been shown to be
      efficacious<sup><a href="#n76">76,77</a></sup>, is dangerous.
      Promoting circumcision as protection against HIV could also
      promote, intended or not, the inference, that a circumcised
      penis is adequate protection from contracting HIV, resulting
      in an increase in HIV infections. The circumcision experiment
      in the United States, which has failed to prevent the spread
      of this pandemic, should serve as a lesson to other
      countries.</p>

      <p class="text2">American men are reluctant to use condoms.
      Studies indicate a considerably higher acceptance and usage
      rate for condoms in Europe and Japan, where circumcision is
      almost never practised. Some have suggested that American men
      are resisting a layer of latex that would further decrease
      sensation from a glans already desensitized from the
      keritinization following circumcision. Moreover, condoms are
      more likely to fall off the circumcised penis<sup><a
      href="#n78">78</a></sup>. This low acceptance of condoms may
      be responsible for the high rate of STD and teenage pregnancy
      rates in the United States--the only industrialized country
      that has failed to control bacterial STDs during the AIDS
      era<sup><a href="#n79">79</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">Wise allocation of our resources demands
      that we divert our attention away from treating unproven risk
      factors and focus on proven prophylactic interventions.</p>
