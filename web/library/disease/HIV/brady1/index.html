      <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>

      <p class="abstract">There are over 100 million girls and
      women who have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM). The
      World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that another 2
      million are subject to it every year. FGM is practiced in
      many countries, especially Africa and parts of the Middle
      East. Various degrees of FGM are prevalent, the most
      mutilating one being infibulation (pharaonic). With
      infibulation there are numerous life-long health problems
      such as hemorrhage, infection, dyspareunia, genital ulcers,
      and gynecological and obstetrical complications. It has been
      postulated that FGM may also play a significant role in
      facilitating the transmission of HIV infection through
      numerous mechanisms. In this article several of the most
      common complications are discussed and helpful suggestions
      for management during pregnancy and delivery are explored.
      Included are the legal and ethical ramifications.</p>

      <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

      <p class="text1"><font size="7">F</font>EMALE GENITAL
      MUTILATION (FGM), which is inaccurately referred to as female
      circumcision by some people, has been practiced for
      centuries. Egyptian mummies were found to have been
      circumcised as far back as 200 B. C. In the 19th Century it
      was practiced in Europe and North America as a remedy for
      ailments like epilepsy, hysteria, and masturbation.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> The practice of FGM is most prevalent
      in the African countries such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan,
      Egypt, and some area of the Middle East. It is not restricted
      to any ethnic, religious or socioeconomic class. There are
      many reasons for perpetuation of this practice, the most
      common are cultural and religious beliefs. Although often
      associated with Islam, it is also practiced by other
      religious groups, including Christians. There is no mention
      of it in the Koran. An overwhelming factor for its
      justification is the cultural influence and traditions,
      social acceptance within the community, and ensuring chastity
      and fidelity by attenuating sexual desire.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2,3</a></sup> A research study done in Nigeria on
      the Igbos tribe found that women believe that FGM makes them
      more feminine and thus more attractive to men.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> A recent social study carried out
      established that FGM raises the social status for the family
      and generates income when the daughter gets married and the
      dowry is paid.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <center>
        <b>CLINICAL TOPOGRAPHY</b>
      </center>

      <p class="text1">The World Health Organization (WHO), in an
      effort to standardize the terminology has divided FGM into
      four main groups. Dr. Naid Toubia, who has researched and
      written extensively on this topic, has identified two types.
      He combines type I and II and divides infibulation into type
      III and IV.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> This is not the
      case with WHO. For the purposes of this article, the WHO
      clinical classifications will be followed.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Type I&mdash;Clitoridectomy is the removal of prepuce
        and all or part of the clitoris. Also called Sunna
        Circumcision.<sup><a href="#n6">6-8</a></sup> This is the
        least mutilating one.</li>

        <li>Type II&mdash;The clitoris and part of the labia are
        excised and then sewn together by sutures, thorns, or tying
        the girl's legs together until the edges have
        united.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></li>

        <li>Type III&mdash;Infibulation (pharaonic) is the most
        extreme. Here the clitoris, labia minora are excised and
        incisions made in the labia majora to create raw surfaces
        that are then either stitched together or kept in close
        contact until they seal and form a cover for the urethral
        meatus. A very small orifice is left for the passage of
        urine and menstrual flow. Because this type is the most
        mutilating, the medical, obstetrical, and psychological
        complications are more profound. In many regions it is the
        most common procedure performed (e.g., in Djibouti and
        Somalia 98% of FGM are infibulations).<sup><a
        href="#n6">6,7,9</a></sup> (See Fig. 1)</li>
      </ul>

      <center>
        <img src="Fig1.gif" alt="line drawing" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">WHO has indentified a new category type IV,
      which encompasses other types of operations such as gihiri
      cut, piercing, cauterization, and insertion of corrosive
      substances into the vagina. Of course, one must remember that
      FGM is carried out mainly in villages by lay people, with
      little knowledge of anatomy, so there often occurs a
      combination of all of these types. FGM is performed any time
      from birth to just before marriage, but most commonly done
      between the ages of 4 to 10 years.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <h4>COMMON COMPLICATIONS</h4>

      <p class="text1">Complications following FGM, especially if
      the girl is infibulated, are common and many are well
      documented. These may be immediate or late. The major
      immediate complications are, of course, hemorrhage from the
      dorsal artery, shock and then infection, urinary retention
      and tetanus, which can lead to mortality.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10-12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Some late and long-term complications seen
      are urinary incontinence, cysts, urogenital tract infections,
      severe dyspareunia, pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility,
      and obstetrical problems such as delayed or obstructed second
      stage labor, trauma, and hemorrhage. Hemorrhage was also seen
      as a late complication especially in the newly married girl
      who was tightly infibulated and was subjected to forcible sex
      by the husband or who the husband defibulated using various
      instruments such as scissors, blades or knives.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,6,12,13</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <center>
      <img src="Table1.gif" alt="table one" />
    </center>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text2">In the research done by <a
      href="/pages/female/dirie1/">Dirie and Lindmark</a> in
      Somalia on 290 women (mean age 22 years, range 18 to 54), 88%
      of research subjects had excision and infibulation, the
      remainder fell into the less mutilating categories.
      Sixty-nine percent had this procedure performed at home and
      52% of these were performed by an untrained person. The
      immediate main complication reported by 112 women in the
      study was hemorrhage, infection, urinary retention, and
      septicemia (see Table 1). Five women reported severe schock
      and two of them required blood transfusions. Those women with
      urinary retention were treated by splitting the infibulation
      scar and were reinfibulated a few weeks later. The late
      complication of which 108 women complained, were as follows:
      36 with clitoral cysts, 29 requiring excision; 57 with pain
      on micturition; and 15 subjects had poor urinary flow (see
      Table 2).</p>
    </div>

    <center>
      <img src="Table2.gif" alt="table two" />
    </center>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text2">Hemorrhage is an immediate as well as a late
      complication. For hemostasis the girl's legs are tied
      together and sometimes a poultice of crushed medicinal herbs
      is applied.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The urinary retention reported by the women
      in the Dirie/Lindmark study occurred within the first 3 days
      after the operation and the reason given by the authors was
      that the girls tried to avoid passing urine because of the
      pain that urine causes when it irritates the raw surfaces.
      The retention was also due to skin flaps, blood clots or, in
      several cases the urinary meatus was sutured while closing
      the vulva.</p>

      <p class="text2">Recurrent urinary tract infections and
      urinary problems were numerous, and according to
      Dirie/Lindmark, these were caused because the meatus was
      covered by the infibulation, causing vaginal dischange to
      accumulate and favor the growth of bacteria. The women
      reported that they were given antibiotics by their doctor and
      this helped.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> DeSilva<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> reported that urinary tract
      infection with Escherichia coli was common in these
      women.</p>

      <p class="text2">The most common late complication of FGM
      that was reported by Dirie and several other authors was
      vulvar swelling, which was due to epidermal cyst formation
      that develops along the scar tissue and in the excised
      clitoral region. Hanly<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>
      discusses 10 patients that attended the hospital in Tabuk,
      Saudia Arabia. All patients were immigrants into the Kingdom
      from Africa. Six patients presented with a large painless
      mass in the infibulation scar. Two complained of pain, one
      gave a history of a white continuous secretion for the scar
      site, and one complained of severe dyspareunia and had a cyst
      measuning 5.5 X 5 X % cm. The pathological finding in eight
      patients was of an implantation dermoid, in the other two
      patients the cyst had ruptured.</p>

      <p class="text2">Mayad<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup>
      discusses the fibrous connective tissue tumors called
      fibromata. These form in the same areas as the dermoid cysts
      and also can grow to be large and pedunculated.</p>

      <h4>SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE,<br />
       PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE,<br />
       AND INFERTILITY</h4>

      <p class="text1">Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a common
      complication of sexually transmitted disease (STD) is
      accompanied by abdominal pain, infertility, and ectopic
      pregnancy. Research indicates that PID is a major problem
      worldwide and in some African countries, 22 to 44% of women
      admitted to the hospital for gynecological problems had PID.
      In women 20-29 years old, 7 to 25% of them were
      childless.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> The most prevalent
      organisms were <i>Neisseria gonnorrhoeae</i> and <i>Chlamydia
      trachomatis</i>. However, it is now believed that FGM plays a
      significant role in the development of PID. For the woman who
      has been infibulated there are added risks of infection and
      resulting infertility. It has been reported by Sami and El
      Dareer<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> that chronic pelvic
      disease was three times more prevalent in the infibulated
      women. Chronic retention of unire, menstrual flow, and
      repeated urinary tract infections with <i>E. coli</i> are the
      consequences of poor drainage, which results from a space
      fromed behind the vulva skin. This then becomes an excellent
      reservoir for the growth of pathogenic organisms such as the
      <i>E. coli</i>.<sup><a href="#n3">3,14,16</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Shandall<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> and
      DeSilva<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> reported a high
      incidence of candiasis, which was more frequent with
      infibulation, and urine cultures showed the presence of mixed
      organisms, specifically <i>E. coli</i>. Shandall has
      suggested three main causes of PID in the infibulated woman,
      namely: (1) infection at the time of infibulation, (2)
      interference with drainage and (3) infection from spliting
      the infibulation and resulting resuture after labor. The
      infections then spread to the inner reproductive organs
      causing infertility.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14,16,17</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <center>
      <img src="Table3.gif" alt="table three" />
    </center>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text2">Rushwan states that FGM should be recognized
      as an important etiological factor for PID.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> Another reason for infertility is
      acquired gynetresia which according to Ozumba, is directly
      related to infibulation. In a study done by Ozumba in Eastern
      Nigeria on 78 women (see Tables 3 and 4), 59 patients (76%)
      had acquired gynetresia caused by infibulation. Sexual
      intercourse is generally difficult and the process of
      deinfibulation painful and can take 2-12 weeks to complete or
      even up to 2 years during which time the women seeks medical
      help for infertility.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <center>
      <img src="Table4.gif" alt="table four" />
    </center>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text2">It is estimated that 2-25% of the cases of
      infertility in the Sudan are due to infibulation, either as a
      result of chronic pelvic infection or because of difficulty
      in having sexual intercourse and lack of penetration. In this
      society the psychological and social impact of being sterile
      must be profound because a woman's worth is frequently
      measured by her fertility, and being sterile can be cause for
      a divorce.</p>

      <h4>POSSIBLE HIV TRANSMISSION</h4>

      <p class="text1">It has been postulated that FGM may play a
      role in the transmission of HIV. One recent article which,
      was presented at the International Conference on AIDS 1998,
      was a study performed on 7350 young girls less than 16 years
      old in Dar es Salaam. In addition to other aspects of the
      research, it was revealed that 97% of the time, the same
      equipment could be used on 15-20 girls. The conclusion of the
      study was that the use of the same equipment facilitated
      HIV/AIDS/STD transmission.<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">At the same conference, a research study
      performed in Nairobi indicated that FGM predisposes women to
      HIV infection in many ways (e.g., increased need for blood
      transfusions due to hemorrhage either when the procedure is
      performed, at childbirth, or a result of vaginal tearing
      during defibulation and intercourse, and the use of the same
      instruments for other initiates). Because FGM raises the
      social status of the parents, the dowry demands can be high
      and therefore the young girls can be married off to older men
      who are already infected.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>
      Contact with blood during intercourse is believed to be
      responsible for the transmission on HIV infection among
      homosexuals.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Women who have had FGM done have a small
      opening, just large enough for the passage of urine and
      blood. Penetration or intercourse is difficult, often
      resulting in tissue damage, lesions, and postcoital bleeding.
      These tears would tend to make the squamous vaginal
      epithelium similar in permeability to the columnar mucosa of
      the rectum, thus facilitaing the possible transmission of
      HIV.<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> The vaginal introitus is
      narrowed to increase the man's sexual enjoyment and ensure
      fidelity and virginity. However, because of the this many
      women experience severe dyspareunia.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9,16</a></sup> Other common reasons for the
      dyspareunia are epidermal or dermoid cysts, which form along
      the incisional site. These can be a small as a pea or as
      large as a football.<sup><a href="#n">13</a></sup> These
      often become infected, painful, and a common reason for the
      woman seeking medical help. Dyspareunia can also be a result
      of neuromata that are formed when the dorsal nerve ending is
      trapped in scar tissue, resulting in immense pain and severe
      dyspareunia.<sup><a href="#n23">23-25</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <center>
      <img src="Table5.gif" alt="table five" />
    </center>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text2">Unlike the rest of the world, sub-Saharan
      Africa has been more severely affected by HIV/AIDS. The sheer
      number of Africans infected is overwhelming. What is also of
      interest and concern is the number of women who are infected.
      The latest statistical data coming from WHO indicates that in
      Africa the ratio of male to female is 1:1, while in Europe
      and North America it is 4:1 (see Table 5). In Zimbabwe at 23
      surveillance sites where the pregnant women were all tested
      anonymously for HIV, some 20-50% of them were found to be
      infected. At least one third of these women are likely to
      pass the infection on to their baby.<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Linke points to the common factor of contact
      with blood during intercourse for transmission of HIV in
      homosexuals in the United States and heterosexuals in
      Africa.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> <span
      class="yellow">For many of the women with FGM who have been
      infibulated (pharaonic), vagina intercourse is difficult at
      best and is associated with repeated tissue damage and
      bleeding, subsequently anal intercourse is resorted to with
      heterosexual partners. Thus the proposition that HIV
      transmission is enhanced because of the widespread practice
      of FGM.</span><sup><a href="#n21">21,25</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">It is difficult for researchers to obtain
      accurate statistical data on anal intercourse for a host of
      reasons. Because of their cultural background, African women
      feel uncomfortable and shy discussing their sexual habits,
      and this is certainly true in the presence of males other
      than their husbands. Societal disapproval of anal intercourse
      is especially strong in areas where the majority of the
      population is Catholic, and admitting such behaviors can
      involve ostracization from the community.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> Moore et al.,<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup> in a study done on 1480 students in
      Zaire, found that 19% stated that they practiced anal
      intercourse. Because the question of homosexuality and anal
      sex is considered taboo, many Africans, male and female, are
      unwilling to discuss or admit to these practices, so these
      are believed to be grossly underreported. There is a large
      body of convincing evidence that genital ulceration and other
      STDs increase susceptibility to HIV infection.<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup> In reseach done by Allen et
      al.<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> on HIV infection in urban
      Rwanda, the association between dyspareunia and nonmenstrual
      bleeding are often seen as signs and symptoms of undiagnosed
      venereal disease.<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> In fact, in
      almost all of the research, genital lesions and ulcerations
      are discussed in the context of STD. The European study did
      report that in women with a history of candidiasis, the rate
      of HIV infection was significantly higher.<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup> As stated earlier and by many
      authors, included in the complications of HIV infection was
      significantly higher.<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup> As
      stated earlier and by many authors, included in the
      complications of FGM are severe dyspareunia, postcoital
      bleeding, ulceration and a high incidence of
      candidiasis.<sup><a href="#n3">3,6,10,23,21,29</a></sup>
      There is no conclusive evidence on the linkage of FGM to HIV
      transmission. However, Post<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup>
      describes an incident from a letter sent by the Minority
      Rights Group to Ammnesty International as follows: "While in
      Malawi a couple of months ago, I came across the story of a
      14 year-old girl of Yao tribe that inhabits land in the
      Southern end of the country. She was diagnosed as
      HIV-positive although she was a virgin. Blame was laid on the
      fact that during tribal circumcision, the same razor would be
      used on any number of children at the same time."<sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup> Perhaps future research on HIV
      transmission should include, as a variable, women who have
      had FGM performed because they also have genital ulcers and
      abrasions. If there were conclusive evidence linking FGM with
      the transmission of HIV, this may then become the best weapon
      in the arsenal for eradication of this practice.</p>

      <h4>OBSTETRICAL COMPLICATIONS</h4>

      <p class="text1">There are many obstetrical complications
      associated with infibulation, for the mother and fetus/baby.
      However, Mawad and other authors<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> stress that with careful planning,
      good antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care, most of
      these can be avoided. Some of the main complications are
      delayed second-stage labor, perineal tearing, vesicovaginal
      fistula, and low birth weight babies. It has been reported
      that some pregnant women reduce their dietary intake to avoid
      giving birth to large babies.<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup>
      The obstetrical management for those patients is important
      and often difficult for those that have not had this type of
      exposure.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Norwich Park Hospital in the United
      Kingdom has established an "African Well Woman Clinic" with a
      specially trained staff and protocols in place for the
      management of the FGM women. The necessity for this arose
      because of the high influx of immigrants from the Sudan and
      Somalia. These areas in Africa are where infibulation is
      practiced on at least 95% of the women. On staff there is a
      female Somali translator and a Sudanese psychologist. Since
      the clinic's inception the number of persons visiting the
      clinic has risen from under 1% to almost 6%. In the research
      done by McCaffery on 50 of the patients that attended the
      clinic, 13 were nonpregnant, 14 were primigravida, and 23
      multigravida. The main reason for the nonpregnant women's
      attendance was to request defibulation. At first visit the
      average gestational age was 15-20 weeks. Of the 14
      primigravida patients, 7 had an adequate introitus to
      facilitate first- and second-stage labor. One patient had a
      deinfibulation done earlier, two requested antenatal
      deinfibulation and three preferred the procedure to be done
      at the time of delivery (one patient did not return to the
      clinic). Thirteen (93%) primigravida patients had vaginal
      deliveries, and all of these had either episiootomies or
      perineal lacerations. Fourteen (61%) multiparous had vaginal
      deliveries. Six (25.1%) had caesarean sections, and with
      three (13%) instrumentation was used. Included in this
      research is an excellent in-depth discussion of the problems
      encountered and the obstetrical management Two cases are
      discussed in detail. The first was a 26-year-old Sudanese
      (primigravida) presented at 26 weeks gestation with severe
      vulval itching. The introital opening measured less than 1
      cm, so a speculum exam was not possible. A swab was passed
      and cultured <i>Candida albicans.</i> However, the insertion
      of the applicator for clotrimazole cream was not possible.
      Because of the severity of her symptoms, the woman underwent
      defibulation at 28 weeks' gestation and subsequently had a
      normal vaginal delivery.</p>

      <p class="text2">For the infibulated mother in labor with a
      narrow introitus, the inability to do a vaginal exam to
      monitor progress, apply fetal scalp electrodes, or blood
      sampling are for the obstetrician mid-wife serous reasons for
      concern. The second case discussed was that of a 20-year-old
      Somali primigravida admitted with contractions at full term.
      The introitus barely admitted one finger and cardiotocography
      of the fetal heart showed 60 bpm without a contraction. An
      epidural anesthesia was administered to facilitate vaginal
      exam, and at this time the cervix was 2 cm dilated.
      Artificial rupture of the membrane was performed and revealed
      thick black meconium. The decision was made to perform a
      cesarean section. However a catherization could not be done,
      so deinfibulation was carried out to facilitate this.<sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup> The author while in Saudia Arabia in
      1980, found that a urethral catherization on the infibulated
      woman was quite difficult and unsuccessful at times due to
      extensive scar tissue, bands, and anatomical distortion.
      Valuable time can be lost in an emergency. The staff at the
      African Well Woman Clinic have developed a high level of
      expertise in caring for the infibulated woman, and from
      research it is evident that they have incorporated all
      aspects of well-being including psychological and cultural.
      The staff strongly recommends antenatal defibulation or
      elective reversal either before pregnancy, at 20 weeks
      gestation or if seen later in pregnancy than at 38 weeks. It
      takes about 1 week for the reversal to heal. This procedure
      should be performed under spinal anesthesia because the
      sensation of touch triggers flashbacks of the infibulation in
      childhood. In the nonpregnant women, general anesthesia is
      recommended.</p>

      <h4>LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS</h4>

      <p class="text1">Many countries such as Canada, England,
      Sweden, Australia, and others have enacted statutes
      prohibiting FGM and reinfibulation after delivery. In the
      United States a law was passed in 1997 which criminalizes FGM
      performed on a person who has not reached the age of 18 years
      but it does not address women older than 18 or reinfibulation
      after delivery. Infibulation was made illegal in Sudan in
      1946 and still today nearly 90% of the women in Sudan have
      been subjected to FGM.<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup>
      Because FGM is now illegal, many young girls are taken out of
      the country to have it performed. The Center for Disease
      Control and Prevention estimates that there are over 150,000
      females at risk in the United States for undergoing
      FGM.<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup> Clearly it will take
      more than legislation to eradicate this practice that can no
      longer be seen as a religious or traditional custom. One
      cannot mount an ethical defense for a practice that results
      in such a negative impact on a woman's health. This is not
      only a problem for countries where it is performed, but also
      for the Western Countries.</p>

      <p class="text2">Health-care providers have an important role
      to fulfill in the eradication of this practice. We should act
      as advocates and increase professional and public awareness
      about such a practice, explaining the dangers and life-long
      disabilities it imposes. Perhaps the well-known crusader for
      eradication of FGM, who herself had this done, Merserak
      (Mimi) Ramsey, spoke for all women when she said, "This is a
      pain that doesn't go away. It is a lifetime wound,"<sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup></p>
