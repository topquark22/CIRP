      <p class="text1"><span class="initial">A</span>T the XVI
      International Conference on AIDS in Toronto in August 2006,
      assurances that the world was succeeding in fighting AIDS
      appeared shaky, or at least part of a new positive global
      &lsquo;&lsquo;spin&rsquo;&rsquo; provided by the
      international agencies and the new AIDS celebrities (former
      US President Bill Clinton, philanthropists Bill and Melinda
      Gates, actor Richard Gere and the then UN Special Envoy for
      HIV/ AIDS in Africa, Stephen Lewis). In fact, the pandemic is
      not under control in sub-Saharan Africa, in South, Eastern
      and Central Asia, or in parts of the Asia&ndash;Pacific
      region. Even in the USA, among minority ethnic and racial
      populations HIV prevalence continues to rise, if unevenly.
      Moreover, among the gay communities of the developed world,
      for so long the best examples of successful and early
      prevention efforts, there is talk of resurgent epidemics and
      of largely hidden epidemics among men who have sex with men
      in Latin America and Asia.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> All
      is not well in the fight against HIV/AIDS.</p>

      <p class="text2">In response to these worrying signs, the
      discourse on HIV prevention at the Toronto conference focused
      on the recently coined notion of &lsquo;&lsquo;prevention
      technologies&rsquo;&rsquo; which, while not including
      behaviour change, does include cervical barriers,
      pre-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs, herpes
      suppression, microbicides, HIV vaccines, and as a newcomer to
      the list and, lauded as having most immediate promise, male
      circumcision. Deploying a very masculinist metaphor, male
      circumcision was often hailed at the Toronto conference as
      the newest &lsquo;&lsquo;weapon in the
      arsenal&rsquo;&rsquo;.* Such a narrowly conceived range of
      biomedical prevention strategies, and their rendition as
      &lsquo;&lsquo;technologies&rsquo;&rsquo;, resonates with
      discourses now dominating the international HIV/AIDS field
      that favour medical intervention and morally sanctioned
      control over community mobilisation and activism for
      establishing and sustaining changes in behaviour. The USA,
      particularly under the current administration, has shifted
      the agenda in the direction of achieving its moral ends, and
      has pushed the longer-term collective memory of HIV
      prevention successes otherwise achieved out of the spotlight.
      The fact that each of these &lsquo;&lsquo;prevention
      technologies&rsquo;&rsquo; ultimately relies on human
      behaviour &ndash; putting on the condoms, inserting the
      microbicides, taking the pills, deciding to fund a programme
      of herpes suppression &ndash; seems not to be noticed.</p>

      <p class="text1">The enthusiastic support for male
      circumcision in Toronto was not based solely on completed
      scientific studies. It was based, too, on enthusiasm for the
      <i>potential</i> findings from two randomised clinical trials
      (RCTs)<sup>&dagger;</sup> then underway in Rakai, Uganda, and
      Kisumu, Kenya, and on longstanding recognition of a relation
      between male circumcision and HIV prevalence. The trials
      in</p>
      <hr size="1" width="50%" align="left" />
      <span class="footnote">*See Waldby (1996) for a discussion of
      how such masculinist metaphors dominate the science of
      HIV/AIDS.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup><br />
       <sup>&dagger;</sup> RCTs are more commonly termed randomized
      controlled trials, but the RCTs in this case were clinical
      experiments and are referred to as randomized clinical
      trials.</span><br />
      <br />
       
      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 34</span> 

      <p class="text1">question were being undertaken following
      findings from observational studies that noted in some places
      (but not everywhere) an association between higher rates of
      male circumcision and lower HIV prevalence,<sup><a
      href="#n3">3&ndash;6</a></sup> from systematic reviews of the
      literature on circumcision,<sup><a href="#n7">7,8</a></sup>
      and from an earlier trial in Orange Farm in South Africa that
      found a partially protective effect of 61%.9 Preliminary
      findings from the subsequent trials in Uganda and Kenya were
      reported after they were stopped early by their respective
      Data Safety and Monitoring Boards in December 2006, as these
      trials were reporting interim efficacy findings of 48%
      (Uganda) and 53% (Kenya), and it would have been unethical to
      continue.</p>

      <p class="text2">However, the rhetoric coming from the
      Toronto conference in August 2006 suggested that it was
      simply a procedural nicety to have to wait for the evidence
      from these trials. Not all Toronto conferees shared the
      euphoria, of course. Many were less sanguine, and for a
      variety of reasons. There are, after all, many extant and
      polarised, popular and professional debates and discussions
      on male circumcision in medical science as well as in more
      general public health arenas. At Toronto, sociologists and
      anthropologists in particular were sceptical of the narrow
      form of &lsquo;&lsquo;science&rsquo;&rsquo; being touted as
      the only form of evidence needed. Activists and
      practitioners, e.g. people living with HIV and AIDS, those
      working in the non-governmental sector and prevention workers
      &ndash; those who comprise the bulk of the &lsquo;&lsquo;AIDS
      community&rsquo;&rsquo; &ndash; were concerned with a
      potential undercutting of their hard-won shifts in sexual
      cultures, in many places, toward safe sex practices.</p>

      <p class="text2">Indeed, the clamour for circumcision
      silenced many questions, overrode any misgivings and swept
      sceptics to the sidelines. Silenced, too, was any call for
      the kind of ongoing evidence-based decision-making on male
      circumcision as a preventive technology that acknowledges
      that &lsquo;&lsquo;what causes something to happen has
      nothing to do with the number of times we observe it
      happening&rsquo;&rsquo;,<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> and
      consequently, has a concern to investigate <i>how</i> any
      intervention will work, not just that it might. Approaches,
      such as that of evidence-based policy development proposed by
      Pawson in 2006,<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> require a
      certain <i>weight of evidence</i> about the nature of
      causality that takes into account outcome patterns,
      generative social and cultural mechanisms, and contextual
      textual conditions. Little of this kind of evidence is
      available in the results of the trials reported so far.</p>

      <p class="text2">Detailed findings from the Uganda and Kenya
      trials were published in the <i>Lancet</i> in February
      2007,<sup><a href="#n12">12,13</a></sup> reporting adjusted
      efficacy findings on an intention-to-treat analysis of 51%
      (Uganda) and 53% (Kenya), with modified analyses taking into
      account particularities of sampling and field procedures
      yielding figures of 55% and 60% efficacy respectively.* These
      findings were published just before a major international
      consultation on Male Circumcision and HIV Prevention:
      Research Implications for Policy and Programming was convened
      by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS in
      Montreux, Switzerland, 6&ndash;8 March 2007.&dagger; The
      meeting formulated draft recommendations to the world from
      WHO/UNAIDS and the rest of the UN system on adopting male
      circumcision as one additional approach to enhancing
      prevention efforts in high HIV prevalence, generalised
      epidemics where HIV transmission between women and men is the
      major route of infection. A WHO/UNAIDS Statement on the
      Conclusions and Recommendations of that meeting was released
      on 28 March 2007 (hereafter, the WHO/UNAIDS Statement).**</p>

      <p class="text2">In this paper, we examine the evidence used
      to argue for the adoption of male circumcision as an HIV
      prevention technology, and discuss just what kinds of
      evidence were used, and what was and is still missing from
      the debate and discussion. We ask: does the new policy arena
      now supported officially by WHO/UNAIDS, featuring male
      circumcision as another prevention tool, measure up to
      demands for an appropriate weight of evidence for such a
      policy? How has the matter of evidence travelled from the
      clamour</p>

      the trials.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup><br />

      post-Montreux WHO/UNAIDS statement?</p>

      <h4>Just how is male circumcision talked about?</h4>

      <p class="text1">Part of the dilemma in understanding how
      male circumcision comes to figure in HIV/AIDS discussions can
      be gleaned from the confusing way the practice is talked
      about. Looking at the popular press, statements from AIDS
      celebrities and online discussion groups, we note that some
      proponents speak of male circumcision in terms of a
      &lsquo;&lsquo;one-time intervention&rsquo;&rsquo; offering
      &lsquo;&lsquo;life-time protection&rsquo;&rsquo;, while
      others frame it as an &lsquo;&lsquo;irreversible
      procedure&rsquo;&rsquo; with only &lsquo;&lsquo;partial
      protection&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

      <p class="text2">This &lsquo;&lsquo;prevention
      technology&rsquo;&rsquo; can be contrasted to an
      &lsquo;&lsquo;historical and cultural practice&rsquo;&rsquo;.
      Several UNAIDS documents refer to &lsquo;&lsquo;thorny
      issues&rsquo;&rsquo; surrounding male circumcision and its
      widespread implementation,<sup><a href="#n15">15,16</a></sup>
      while social scientists would term these as
      &lsquo;&lsquo;social and cultural factors&rsquo;&rsquo; or
      even &lsquo;&lsquo;determinants&rsquo;&rsquo; that suffuse
      the issue. &lsquo;&lsquo;Scientific evidence&rsquo;&rsquo;
      (usually meaning medical or experimental) is all that some
      require to underpin mass application of male circumcision as
      a prevention intervention, but what of evidence that includes
      &lsquo;&lsquo;cultural values, moral issues and social
      impact&rsquo;&rsquo;?</p>

      <p class="text2">The adverse effects of circumcision as a
      surgical procedure are much discussed and are regarded by
      some in the current debates as of importance,<sup><a
      href="#n17">17&ndash;20</a></sup> but often as the only
      consequence of concern and one amenable to clinical
      management. Others see effects on sexual lives, pleasures,
      relations, meanings and cultures.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21,22</a></sup> Male circumcision is often framed
      as a &lsquo;&lsquo;population health&rsquo;&rsquo;
      intervention, but ethical and human rights issues for the
      individuals involved need to be included for consideration
      too. Whether these two frameworks are incommensurable in the
      case of male circumcision remains an unaddressed
      issue.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> Finally, there is
      tension between broad generalisations that see global
      potential, or an &lsquo;&lsquo;African
      solution&rsquo;&rsquo;, and longstanding recognition of the
      quite specific contribution of places, times, social
      networks, populations and cultures to all successful
      prevention programmes.</p>
      <br />
       

      <h4>The medical literature on male circumcision</h4>

      <p class="text1">Ironically, and in contrast to the Toronto
      clamour, medical science usually takes these quite diverse
      critical perspectives into account.</p>

      <p class="text2">A Medline review of the literature on male
      circumcision from 1996 to 2006 revealed five broad categories
      of concern: adverse effects, ethics, ethology, history, and
      legislation and jurisprudence (see Table 1). Comparisons are
      drawn with literature from the same period on appendectomy
      and hysterectomy. Appendectomy might be regarded as the
      surgical removal of a part of the body seen as somewhat
      unimportant &ndash; in the way that foreskins might also be
      regarded. Hysterectomy is a more serious and controversial
      sexual and reproductive health operation, which also might be
      a way to regard male circumcision. While the number of
      articles on hysterectomy is almost twice that of the other
      two procedures combined, the percentage of articles about
      adverse effects of male circumcision is twice that of the
      other two procedures. In the other Medline sub-categories,
      the percentage of articles on male circumcision was three or
      four times that of the other</p>

      <p class="text1">procedures, with legislation and
      jurisprudence having ten times the number of articles on male
      circumcision than the other procedures. Indeed, the major
      medical associations of the USA, UK, Australia, New Zealand,
      Canada and South Africa, for example, have not in general
      supported male circumcision except where medically indicated,
      and have been particularly wary of the circumcision of
      neonates. For medical science, then, this prevention
      technology is a far more complex, problematic and contested
      procedure. Is HIV/AIDS an arena where these fields of concern
      receive the same level of attention and where the breadth of
      evidence on such issues is valued and taken into account?</p>
      <br />
       

      <h4>The weight and nature of evidence on male circumcision
      and HIV/AIDS</h4>

      <p class="text1">Pawson&rsquo;s approach to evidence-based
      policy adopts a <i>generative model of causation</i>, that
      is, seeking to understand causal powers within the objects or
      agents or structures under investigation. Pawson argues
      that:</p>

      <p class="text1">&lsquo;&lsquo;. . .<i>in order to identify
      causal connections, we need to understand outcome
      <u>patterns</u> rather than seek outcome <u>regularities</u>.
      It is the totality of outcomes &ndash; successful,
      unsuccessful, bit of both &ndash; that may act as an initial
      empirical guide for future optimal
      locations</i>.&rsquo;&rsquo;<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup>
      (p.22, author&rsquo;s emphasis)</p>

      <p class="text1">What are the outcome patterns in the
      evidence so far? First, there is some evidence of a
      &lsquo;&lsquo;possible anatomical explanation for the
      epidemiologically observed protective effect of male
      circumcision&rsquo;&rsquo;,<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup>
      concerning the susceptibility to HIV in Langerhans cells in
      the inner foreskin,<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup> and a
      protective keratinisation that occurs after circumcision.
      Yet, Langerhans cells occur in the clitoris, the labia and in
      other parts of both male and female genitals, and no one is
      talking of removing these in the name of HIV prevention.
      Moreover, there is not full agreement on this particular
      argument about susceptibility.<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup> Also, at the Montreux meeting, it
      was pointed out that how keratinisation might work to provide
      a protective effect was actually unclear, and that more
      evidence is needed to support this idea, however plausible it
      appears.</p>

      <p class="text2">Second, the observational studies and
      systematic reviews cited above do not discuss places where
      HIV prevalence is low in non- low-circumcising cultures and
      where the epidemics are also largely sexually driven, such as
      northwestern Europe, South America, and Australia and New
      Zealand. Nor do these reports note the varied and mostly
      escalating epidemics in the USA, some contained, some
      generalised, in the most circumcised nation in theWest, where
      the overall rate of male circumcision is 65% compared with
      30% globally.</p>

      <p class="text2">The absence of comparisons with such
      countervailing evidence produces some uncertainty about the
      strong associations found elsewhere (largely in parts of
      Africa). Indeed, in 2006 Mishra et al and Way et al
      challenged the relation between high male circumcision and
      low HIV prevalence both in some African countries as well as
      in other parts of the developing world, finding protective
      effects only in some countries and no consistent relationship
      in others.<sup><a href="#n27">27,28</a></sup> This needs
      explaining. Is circumcision not the key factor at all times
      and in all places? If not, why not? Are there other
      contributing factors that might be in play? There are many
      questions that such comparisons could answer, but these are
      yet to be addressed adequately through any kind of systematic
      review and analysis &ndash; one that will require, we
      suspect, investigating a different kind of evidence than
      epidemiology usually seeks.</p>
      <br />
       

      <h4>What is the evidence on a generative mechanism?</h4>

      <p class="text1">&lsquo;&lsquo;<i>As far as evidence-based
      policy goes it means breaking with the. . . linguistic habit
      of supposing that it is programmes that work, and resting
      content with counting how often they work. The prerequisite
      is to look beneath the surface in order to inspect how they
      work. The development of cumulative knowledge about
      &lsquo;what works&rsquo; requires sustained investigation of
      the generic mechanism, namely the operation of choices under
      the inducement of programme
      resources</i>.&rsquo;&rsquo;<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup>
      (p.24)</p>

      <p class="text1">The African trials noted a partially
      protective effect, with efficacy somewhere in the order of
      50&ndash;60% (South Africa 61%, Kenya 51%, Uganda 53% &ndash;
      an average of 55% using a modified
      intention-to-treatmeasure). The predictivemodelling provided
      so far suggests potential effectiveness by using efficacy
      figures only,<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> and usually</p>
      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 37</span> 

      <p class="text1">using the Orange Farm figure rather than the
      lower average of all three trials. This is not strong when
      compared with male condoms, with efficacy of 80&ndash;90%.
      Moreover, it is important to note that these are
      <i>efficacy</i> findings, i.e. the results of a particular
      research methodology and only an indication of potential
      <i>effectiveness</i> in real world settings. This distinction
      is important because randomised clinical trial methodology is
      designed mainly to ascertain the contribution of one single
      factor, in this case male circumcision, with other factors
      that might contribute to findings rendered unmeasurable by
      the participant randomisation process or held constant in the
      statistical analysis of the evidence produced. Thus,
      randomised clinical trials produce deliberately
      de-contextualised findings. While it is argued that such
      restrictions produce the highest standard of evidence &ndash;
      probability evidence &ndash; this research methodology has
      its critics and weaknesses, particularly for certain kinds of
      experiments.<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">These trials were relatively well funded
      compared with most real world programmes, with best clinical
      practice guidelines, safeguards, infrastructure and
      well-trained personnel. Therefore, what happened and what was
      achieved are only an indication of what might happen or could
      be achieved in real world contexts when the factors that can
      no longer be controlled for inevitably come into play. This
      is why we need to understand more about what happened in the
      trials beyond the efficacy results, and why we need to
      investigate the effects of those other social and contextual
      factors that will be in play in real world settings &ndash;
      because the effectiveness of male circumcision will not be
      generated by the efficacy of the surgery alone. We need to do
      this before implementation of male circumcision at a
      population level is attempted, as it is an important part of
      the evidence base to help judge what might be possible.</p>

      <p class="text2">One way to assess the potential relationship
      between efficacy and effectiveness is to examine what
      happened in the trials themselves, by examining them as
      social phenomena in their own right. After all, these trials
      were not test tube experiments but experiments conducted in
      clinical settings. Such settings are profoundly social
      moments with real human interactions and complex components,
      even if RCT design in principle tries to circumvent such
      inputs. For example, how do we assess the fact of these
      trials not being double-blinded: the men in each arm clearly
      knew their circumcision status? That known difference could
      have affected how the men responded behaviourally,
      psychologically and sexually. The randomisation process,
      while technically excellent, was in this way somewhat
      compromised. This is not uncommon in trials that involve
      surgical procedures. In the case of the male circumcision
      trials, we might ask how the men in the control arms, who
      were promised delayed circumcision, and had something to lose
      if anything went wrong, understood their current level of
      protection (with some exceptions, they were HIV negative), or
      digested the counselling and sexually transmitted infections
      (STI) treatment offered? How did they understand what was
      happening to their circumcised friends, colleagues and
      community members, particularly when some participants became
      infected (patterns of incident infection were different in
      the early stage of each trial)? How did the communities
      surrounding the participants respond to their differing
      circumcision status? Even if observed effects in both arms
      moved in the same direction (e.g. similar risk reduction
      effects), it cannot be assumed that the disarticulated nature
      of the arms did not have a differential effect.</p>

      <p class="text2">Randomisation cannot completely obviate such
      effects, because its success is usually judged on procedural
      technicalities, and comparisons between the control and
      intervention arms are most often made on the basis of
      socio-demographic characteristics (e.g. age, education,
      religion) and study-related factors. In the case of these
      trials, sexual practices (number of partners, condom use) and
      sexual health measures (presence of STIs) were used.
      Affective measures were not used, and differences related to
      sexual subjectivity, such as sexual network participation,
      pleasure preferences, body image, sexual history effects
      (e.g. abuse), partner preferences (younger, older, peers,
      groups) and so onwere never assessed or analysed. These kinds
      of dynamic contributors have profound effects on sexual
      practice and will intersect with any sexual expectations,
      individual and interpersonal, that arose in relation to the
      trials and to whatever participants understood them to be
      about, and to what they did sexually while they were
      participating.</p>

      <p class="text2">The trials also involved intensive
      counselling and education, the full details of which have yet
      to be provided. How might these have</p>
      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 38</span> 

      <p class="text1">influenced the participants&rsquo; sexual
      activity, given that they knew their circumcision status and
      had likely been influenced to take part on the basis of
      potentially enhanced protection from HIV infection? There was
      great interest in circumcision among these communities before
      the trials started, as noted by all the research teams, and
      each trial had &lsquo;&lsquo;crossovers&rsquo;&rsquo; (e.g.
      men who sought circumcision elsewhere before the end of the
      trials). This indicates that the promise of possible
      protection suffused these trials discursively and affected
      the communities in which the participants lived, even before
      they produced findings.</p>

      <p class="text2">In addition, all participants were subject
      to regular monitoring (e.g. behaviour surveys, clinical
      check-ups), which clearly might have enhanced compliance with
      suggested safety regimes and lowered risk-taking during the
      follow-up period. Such compliance cannot be guaranteed in
      real world settings. The key issue here is that behavioural
      compliance may have been differentially enhanced in each arm,
      and this may have contributed to risk-taking and
      risk-compensation findings in subtle ways. For example, in
      the South African trial, the mean number of sexual contacts
      was significantly higher in the intervention arm; in Kenya,
      unprotected intercourse was significantly lower and
      consistent condom use was significantly higher in the control
      arm; and in Uganda, there was significantly higher
      inconsistent condom use in the intervention arm.* Other
      behavioural changes moved in similar directions for both
      control and intervention arms. This suggests the need to know
      more about the generative possibilities of these inputs and
      their effects.</p>

      <p class="text2">Condom provision and STI treatment for
      participants (were these better than the treatment and
      provision available in the communities where the trials
      occurred?) make a major contribution to the trial findings.
      They may not have altered the efficacy findings even though
      STI treatment reduces the risk of HIV transmission generally;
      but these contributors offer unknown possibilities for
      understanding the complex dynamics in any potential
      programme. The issue here is how the Hawthorne Effect was in
      operation,<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup> i.e. how the very
      act of participation in the trials (and in any research)
      contributes to compliance and, consequently, helps to explain
      the findings in a more embedded, reflexive and contextualised
      way. Why is this evidence not more prominent? While the
      evidence of a protective effect of male circumcision is
      compelling, there are many other things going on. Indeed,
      much can be learned from such evidence, including from
      participants for whom circumcision did not provide protection
      and who became infected, for developing effective programmes
      that strive to achieve in real world settings what was
      observed experimentally in the trials.</p>

      <p class="text2">What is important to remember is that, while
      the outcomes observed in these various studies certainly
      provide evidence of patterns, and the trials have confirmed
      the efficacy of the surgery, together these do not form the
      only generative mechanisms in developing effective programmes
      in real world settings &ndash; additional contributors will
      be involved too.</p>
      <br />
       

      <h4>Putting male circumcision in context</h4>

      <p class="text1">The discussion above begins to reckon with
      the notion of social and contextual factors and dynamics, and
      how these play out in research, whether they are controlled
      for or not. This leads to a discussion of the more complex
      question of the potential social impact of increased male
      circumcision beyond individual medical indication to
      population health intervention.</p>

      <p class="text1">&lsquo;&lsquo;<i>Interventions, by
      definition, are always inserted into pre-existing conditions.
      . . Programme subjects are always faced with a choice, but it
      is both a limited and a loaded one. Programmes are met with
      constrained choices, located in preexisting conditions, and
      these, as well as the processes internal to the intervention,
      determine the balance between winners and
      losers</i>.&rsquo;&rsquo;<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> (p.
      25)</p>

      <p class="text1">Measuring social and cultural change or
      impact involves a focus on more than the short-term
      monitoring of behaviour change and infection rates over a few
      months or years. The timescale of social impact is
      considerably longer. For example, how do we reckon with risk
      compensation over the life cycle?</p>

      <p class="text2">There are further issues to be addressed
      beyond clinical practice and effect. Should male circumcision
      be re-installed in the name of HIV prevention in societies
      and cultures where it has become merely a symbolic act, e.g.
      partial</p>
      <hr size="1" width="50%" align="left" />
      <span class="footnote">*Noted in a summation paper at the
      Montreux meeting.</span><br />

      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 39</span> 

      <p class="text1">removal of the prepuce, or a simple small
      cut to induce bleeding, or has been abandoned altogether?
      There have been significant differences of opinion within
      circumcising religions on whether the practice should
      continue, with issues such as the origins of male
      circumcision, its connections with sexual violence in the Old
      Testament, the human rights of newborn boys, boys being
      allowed to decide for themselves, pain and adverse effects,
      the nature of human dignity, and so on.<sup><a
      href="#n32">32,33</a></sup> What is to happen in locations
      where circumcision status is a mark of citizenship, of
      religious difference or racial differentiation, or a sign of
      otherness that signals exclusion, marginalisation or
      oppression and violence? A potential for stigma and
      discrimination exists, working in either direction.</p>

      <p class="text2">Real world implementation dynamics may see
      lower levels of effectiveness and a greater influence of
      social and contextual factors that may change the opportunity
      cost of male circumcision in relation to other forms of
      prevention. What can be rolled out and scaled up will be
      subject to politics, human resource problems, problems of
      delivery, infrastructure development and provision, adequate
      and continued funding, and ongoing training, evaluation and
      monitoring. Few of these items are costed into the current
      modelling based on costs available publicly.<sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup> Yet, expectations of what is
      probable are what those contemplating adopting and scaling up
      male circumcision as a prevention strategy need to have,
      instead of impossible targets.</p>

      <p class="text2">To understand the broader social context
      surrounding the trials there are some further questions that
      require answers. The researchers in the WHO/UNAIDS
      consultation often noted that the trials were responding to a
      growing demand for male circumcision. Where did this demand
      come from? How dispersed or concentrated was it (only among
      some young men or communitywide)? How was local acceptability
      of male circumcision assessed and measured? We need some
      motivation studies: why did the young men volunteer for the
      trials; what were they told by the researchers and how did
      they understand it; and what do they understand now that the
      trials have stopped? What were the communication circuits in
      operation: how did/do these young men talk about their
      participation in the trials; was it different in the control
      arm from the intervention arm; how did those in each arm talk
      to those in the other, and about what? How did/do the women
      involved talk about it &ndash; wives, girlfriends, sisters,
      mothers; who was talking to whom and about what?</p>

      <p class="text2">Understanding behavioural shifts is
      particularly difficult. For example, in a recently reported
      Kenyan prospective study,<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup>
      behaviour change among circumcised men appeared to be quite
      volatile, in this case moving from higher levels of risk
      behaviour pre-circumcision, to excellent immediate
      post-operative compliance, followed by a return to the same
      levels of risky behaviour as uncircumcised men within the
      year after circumcision. While these researchers suggest that
      equality at one year provides no evidence of risk
      compensation, the large shifts in behaviour over a 15-month
      period might also suggest considerable capacity for
      behavioural variation in response to social forces or
      pressures. Indeed, Western gay communities, which have been
      behaviourally monitored more closely than anyone else in this
      pandemic, have shown considerable behavioural volatility over
      what are now 20+ years of behavioural research. Monitoring
      behaviour change needs far longer time periods than the
      trials have had the opportunity to do. Risk compensation
      findings of these trials and other observational and
      prospective studies from such short periods must therefore be
      approached with caution.</p>

      <p class="text2">Then there are the adverse effects of male
      circumcision, not just at the time of the surgery but over
      time. The literature on adverse effects of neonatal,
      childhood and adult circumcision is substantial and by no
      means easily reduced to generalisations. Most of this
      literature is about surgery undertaken in the developed
      world; there are far fewer data on medical circumcision in
      the developing world or traditional circumcision
      practices.<sup><a href="#n36">36</a></sup> Beyond individual
      effects and consequent effects on partners and over the life
      course, there may be longer-term social impact, e.g.
      community expectations and understandings over time may
      change and affect compliance and participation in
      circumcision. Furthermore, there may be unintended
      consequences, e.g. stigma may increase for those who choose
      to remain uncircumcised or those who experience sexual
      difficulty as a result of circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Some commentators note that it will be
      important to frame any adoption of male circumcision within
      existing or proposed policies on sexual and</p>
      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 40</span> 

      <p class="text1">reproductive health.<sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup>* The UN Work Plan on Male
      Circumcision #1 mentions this in the background section but
      not in its activities for implementation. Locating male
      circumcision within comprehensive global HIV/AIDS programming
      frameworks such as &lsquo;&lsquo;universal
      access&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&lsquo;integrated
      programmes&rsquo;&rsquo; will be vital. Much of the
      discussion in Montreux noted this, but the WHO/ UNAIDS
      Statement delivers a definite, if somewhat cautious but
      supportive recommendation on
      &lsquo;&lsquo;vertical&rsquo;&rsquo; versus
      &lsquo;&lsquo;integrated&rsquo;&rsquo; programming, the
      details of which were by no means resolved at the meeting
      itself. To comply with calls for a comprehensive package in
      which existing sexual and reproductive health activity and
      integrated HIV/ AIDS initiatives provide a context for what
      is possible in regard to male circumcision is costly,
      expensive and time-consuming, but expert opinion called for
      that in Montreux. Safeguards and principles are sketched in
      the WHO/UNAIDS Statement, but more detailed international
      guidelines need to be developed to assist potential donors
      and those who seek funding to ensure that the advice on the
      primacy of integrated programming is heeded.</p>

      <p class="text2">Finally, much of the discourse has been
      negligent of the experience of the Asian and Latin American
      epidemics &ndash; <i>contained</i> rather than
      <i>generalised</i>, lower prevalence epidemics &ndash; which
      are vastly different. The collateral wash-over of the
      heretofore poorly managed international debate and loosely
      generalised discussion, e.g. in Toronto, is already having an
      effect in other places.&dagger; That effect is not related to
      the evidence &ndash; available only from sub-Saharan Africa
      &ndash; a very specific type of evidence from specific
      places. Part of the problem for male circumcision as a
      prevention strategy is going to involve containing it, both
      as discourse and as practice. There is a politics of male
      circumcision, and anyone with experience in the field of
      HIV/AIDS internationally should have foreseen this. The horse
      has bolted, and the riders at the UN need to get back into
      the saddle.</p>
      <br />
       

      <h4>Other contextual issues</h4>

      <p class="text1">There are a series of other social and
      contextual issues that will vex the global effort in
      prevention, given that the pandemic is not under control. The
      first of these is traditional male circumcision, whether
      religious or ritual, e.g. coming of age.</p>

      <p class="text2">Traditional male circumcision is common in
      some parts of Africa,<sup><a href="#n39">39,40</a></sup> and
      is not without its difficulties, including being implicated
      in HIV transmission itself.<sup><a
      href="#n41">41,42</a></sup> Traditional circumcision
      practices are themselves changing all the time, while
      retaining their symbolic meanings. Many of these may not
      readily transfer to a fully medicalised version of
      circumcision, and quite different processes may be needed
      than those in the trials. Maximising safety in traditional
      practices is not dissimilar to ensuring safety in other
      social practices involving a significant HIV risk, e.g.
      tattooing or scarification, for which there is a good deal of
      experience and guidance.</p>

      <p class="text2">The WHO/UNAIDS Statement implies that
      introducing medical male circumcision in areas of high HIV
      prevalence and low circumcision is the priority in
      sub-Saharan Africa, while developing greater safety among
      traditional high-circumcising cultures is of somewhat lower
      priority.** This argument fails to understand the contexts in
      which male circumcision programmes will operate.
      Increasingly, there are highly mobile patterns of migration
      for work and security purposes in sub-Saharan Africa. Such
      swift social change and turmoil produces rapidly changing
      sexual cultures in which sex becomes a commodity
      intrinsically linked to money, security, safety, survival and
      status.&dagger; &dagger; In these circumstances, someone
      circumcised in a low HIV prevalence, traditional setting at
      15 might find himself working in a low-circumcising, high HIV
      prevalence</p>
      <hr size="1" width="50%" align="left" />
      <span class="footnote">*For example, initiatives such as the
      Alan Guttmacher Institute&rsquo;s: &lsquo;&lsquo;In Their Own
      Right&rsquo;&rsquo;: Addressing The Sexual And Reproductive
      Health Needs Of Men Worldwide, EngenderHealth South
      Africa&rsquo;s &lsquo;&lsquo;Men as Partners&rsquo;&rsquo;
      initiative, and the WHO agenda on the role of men and boys in
      promoting gender equality in health.<br />
       &dagger;The recent public discussion about male circumcision
      in relation to growing HIV incidence among racial and ethnic
      minority men who have sex with men in New York City is just
      one example.<sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup><br />
       **Interestingly, the WHO/UNAIDS Statement says little about
      what to do in those sub-regions where circumcision is common
      and rates of HIV are already high.<br />
       &dagger; &dagger;For example, see Hunter (2006) on the
      changing political economy of sex in South Africa.<sup><a

      <p class="text1">environment, believing himself to be at
      lower risk, or believing himself to be circumcised after a
      ritual that only nicked the foreskin. Local cultures no
      longer live in &lsquo;&lsquo;silos&rsquo;&rsquo;, and
      ensuring that traditional circumcisers and healers increase
      the safety of their practices must be an intrinsic aspect of
      any programme that encourages primarily medical circumcision
      as an HIV prevention strategy.</p>

      <p class="text2">None of the evidence from the trials or the
      previous studies reckoned with this issue (nor did they
      intend to), and only some evidence of these problems was
      presented at the Montreux meeting. UNAIDS is clearly aware of
      these issues,1 but there is not yet sufficient evidence on
      the extent of safety problems or the social complexity of
      traditional circumcision across sub-Saharan Africa (or
      elsewhere in the developing world for that matter), or on the
      level of adverse effects currently experienced,<sup><a
      href="#n36">44,36</a></sup> and how these might be addressed
      at policy and programme level. There were programme successes
      reported in abstracts at the Toronto conference,<sup><a
      href="#n45">45</a></sup> but these barely scratch the surface
      of what might be needed to go to scale on significantly
      improving safety in traditional circumcision. This may be the
      context in some countries in which programmes of medicalised
      circumcision are implemented.</p>

      <p class="text2">Understanding the growing demand for male
      circumcision is going to require some new approaches to
      research. Those involved in the trials and much of the media
      coverage surrounding them, particularly after the trials were
      stopped, noted that there had been an increase in demand for
      male circumcision. Why, when the findings were not yet in?
      What was fuelling it, e.g. among the
      &lsquo;&lsquo;crossovers&rsquo;&rsquo; in all three trials?
      Were the trials themselves responsible or is there an
      increase in the acceptability of male circumcision that has
      its drivers elsewhere?<sup><a href="#n46">46,47</a></sup>
      What was being talked about outside the research settings and
      by whom?</p>

      <p class="text2">There have been dangerous examples of
      inaccurate lay information and specious ideas about HIV/AIDS
      before, e.g. HIV does not cause AIDS, sex with a virgin will
      cure you, lemon juice douches can prevent infection (all
      untrue), and so on. How can the actual findings be separated
      from the global chatter that is happening and avoid
      significant distortions and claims being made? This discourse
      will need to be managed by the global HIV/AIDS community and
      the UN system, as well as national authorities and local
      non-governmental organisations. If not, decisions about
      circumcision, by individuals or by governments, may be taken
      without real knowledge of the pros and cons, the
      applicability to a country&rsquo;s particular epidemic,
      real-world effectiveness versus efficacy, and the dangers,
      benefits and opportunity costs of widespread
      implementation.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are also broader sexuality issues to
      be addressed, and these have almost been ignored in the
      discourse surrounding male circumcision. Gay men and other
      men who have sex with men (MSM) were not included in the
      trials as far as anyone knows. This absence is acknowledged
      in the WHO/UNAIDS Statement. Gay men&rsquo;s sexual practices
      and MSM sexual cultures are different, and no one knows how
      circumcision might play out in them &ndash; although the
      evidence from the USA where perhaps the majority of gay men
      and MSM are circumcised is not encouraging. This is
      particularly true in relation to anal intercourse, a practice
      not restricted to men alone, for it is increasingly clear
      that it occurs between women and men as well.</p>

      <p class="text2">What about men who are sexually active with
      both men and women: how might they and their partners respond
      to circumcision and to the differential infectiousness of
      vaginal and anal intercourse? Yet here, anyone familiar with
      gay men&rsquo;s communities and other MSM subcultures knows
      that there is no one global idea of what it is to live as a
      gay man or to pursue sex with men in other realities. The
      diversity of these sexual cultures is well beyond current
      knowledge, and any circumcision trials mooted for USA gay men
      or in one or two developing countries will produce barely
      applicable evidence in relation to these populations.</p>

      <p class="text2">Beyond these questions lies the vexed issue
      of setting a minimum age for circumcision to occur. The
      earlier in life that the procedure is done, the simpler and
      safer it can be compared with later age surgery. However, the
      human rights and ethical issues surrounding neonatal
      circumcision are quite difficult. Optimally, it should occur
      before the onset of sexual activity, thus avoiding early
      infection and early infection of others. This might require a
      minimum age of 10&ndash;15. Leaving it to age 18, e.g. for
      consent reasons, may be too late in some settings, but it is
      the current age of majority in many countries.</p>
      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 42</span> 

      <p class="text1">The WHO/UNAIDS Statement notes the age of 13
      as the possible starting point, although there was no
      consensus reached on that age at the Montreux meeting, and
      the human rights implications for consent at such a young age
      are complex. The Statement also mentions neonates as a
      logical eventual target &ndash; again, an issue not discussed
      in depth in Montreux, which requires more debate.</p>

      <p class="text2">What of young women, the population at
      greatest risk for HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa? Will
      programmes also have parallel education for young women
      explaining the partially protective effect of male
      circumcision and enabling them to negotiate condom use in the
      face of claims by men that condoms might not be needed now
      that they are circumcised? These questions are deeply
      affected by concepts of masculinity, initiation into
      adulthood, existing practices for male sexual debut (e.g.
      visiting sex workers, group sex, male-to-male sex play) and
      changing cultures of pre-marital sex among young
      people.<sup><a href="#n48">48</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">While male circumcision has few very
      serious, lifelong effects, this does not mean there are no
      effects. Those that exist need to be assessed in their own
      right, including iatrogenic effects, adverse effects from
      both traditional and medical circumcision, diminished sexual
      experience and reduced pleasure that should not be sidelined
      and may need new research.</p>

      <p class="text2">These sexuality issues are not addressed in
      the findings from the trials and earlier studies. At the
      UNAIDS/Caprisa Consultation on Social Science Perspectives on
      Male Circumcision for HIV Prevention in Durban, South Africa,
      in January 2007, a number of social scientific issues were
      raised and recommendations made on a much-needed research
      agenda. It was a short and hastily convened meeting, held far
      too late in the train of events. Nevertheless, it marked a
      start in noting important questions that had been neglected
      in the six years since findings from the first systematic
      review were presented at an informal WHO meeting on male
      circumcision in Durban immediately after the 2004
      International AIDS Conference,<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>
      and which stimulated the call for RCTs to be conducted.
      Little assessment of the social and contextual factors
      determining real world effectiveness has been completed and
      none of the social research proposed in Durban in 2007 has
      been done or could be available at Montreux two months later.
      This is not a textbook example of evidence-based policy
      making, and does not meet the criteria for the
      &lsquo;&lsquo;weight of evidence&rsquo;&rsquo; experts agree
      is required.<sup><a href="#n11">11,49</a></sup></p>
      <br />
       

      <h4>Is there enough evidence to proceed?</h4>

      <p class="text1">We believe we need to know much more about
      male circumcision for HIV prevention before adopting it as a
      population health measure. The WHO/UNAIDS Statement is
      cautious in noting the existence of caveats and gaps, but it
      argues that it is time to go ahead. We would argue that there
      is still much work to do before national authorities and the
      global HIV/AIDS community can feel confident about
      proceeding.</p>

      <p class="text2">The whole question of the acceptability of
      the procedure to individual men, to communities and to
      governments is more complex than has been assessed so far.
      The Orange Farm researchers reported that &lsquo;&lsquo;70%
      of uncircumcised males will accept to be circumcised if MC
      reduces the risk of getting HIV&rsquo;&rsquo;.<sup><a
      href="#n50">50</a></sup> But as has been learned with HIV
      testing, while the idea of being tested may be acceptable, it
      often does not translate into actively seeking a test.<sup><a
      href="#n51">51</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">A different kind of monitoring and
      evaluation process is needed, with a focus on the longerterm
      social and cultural impact of introducing male circumcision
      as a population health intervention, including on gender
      equity, something more than medico-behavioural methods tend
      to use. Medical researchers do not usually have the research
      design skills or theoretical expertise to conceptualise these
      issues and to design instruments for such evaluation and
      monitoring. The controversial nature of this irreversible
      surgical intervention on otherwise healthy bodies for
      longer-term, population-level effects demands high standards
      in this regard.</p>

      <p class="text2">We recognise that many of those advocating
      rapid implementation of male circumcision are motivated by a
      deep desire to halt this pandemic, yet so too are those of
      us, similarly motivated, who are wary of the indecent haste
      with which the discussion about male circumcision has been
      swept up in a tide of enthusiasm based on only one, albeit
      significant, part of the evidence base needed for
      recommending such a radical public health initiative. This is
      partly a &lsquo;&lsquo;means and ends&rsquo;&rsquo;
      discussion: do the ends justify themeans? It is also a
      &lsquo;&lsquo;ways and means&rsquo;&rsquo; discussion: how is
      this</p>
      <hr color="maroon" size="5" />
      <span class="page">Page 43</span> 

      <p class="text1">to be done and at what cost? Moreover, there
      are epistemological and political questions: what is at
      stake, how is that defined and by whom, what evidence
      suffices, who decides and on what basis?</p>

      <p class="text2">At the moment, the enthusiasm for male
      circumcision is proffered to displace the disappointment of
      previous &lsquo;&lsquo;silver&rsquo;&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;&lsquo;magic&rsquo;&rsquo; bullets that have not
      worked as well as we had hoped. It is a dreadful pandemic, to
      be sure; but that does not mean we should lose sight of the
      fact that care, judgement, experience and knowledge are
      required before action. Evidence is but one form of this, and
      the determination not to harm others through haste or
      expedience must prevail.</p>
