      "The African AIDS Epidemic," by J. C. Caldwell and Pat

    <p>According to American historian Frederick Hodges, a common
    thread in the hundred-year-old tradition of Western "medical"
    circumcision advocacy has been a tendency to take whatever
    maladies may hold public attention at a particular time, and to
    hold up circumcision as a preventative or cure for them.[1]
    Born at a time when the American populace was gripped with a
    morbid fear of children masturbating, routine neonatal male
    circumcision has since been encouraged by fears of penile and
    cervical cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, urinary tract
    infections, and simply poor hygiene, during the course of the
    twentieth century.</p>

    <p>A related phenomenon&mdash;which continues to this
    day&mdash;has been a tendency in the literature to emphasize
    even the most tentative results <i>in favour</i> of male
    neonatal circumcision, while at the same time fastidiously
    avoiding any implication that the amputation of the foreskin
    could have disadvantages. Popular men's health books abound
    with myths about the natural penis. American medical journals
    still publish articles claiming that it is necessary to
    circumcise boys&mdash;but not girls. Circumcision has, after
    all, become accepted by Western medicine, a system that prides
    itself on providing the best possible standards of care. There
    is a human need to find good in all things that we do. "The
    African AIDS Epidemic," by the Australian demographer John C.
    Caldwell and anthropologist Pat Caldwell, is a remarkable
    example.</p>

    <p>The Caldwell argument is based solely on an observed
    geographical correlation between male non-circumcision rates
    and HIV-1 rates in Africa. The region in which most men are not
    circumcised correlates well with the so-called "AIDS belt," the
    region defined here as that in which some 10% of rural and 23%
    of urban inhabitants are infected with HIV-1. (The AIDS
    epidemic in Africa is predominantly a heterosexual problem.)
    Earlier studies of the correlation had been criticized for
    having used older data that may be inaccurate; Caldwell assures
    us that the data is new and reliable, although it is not
    mentioned whether or not they accounted for certain well-known
    confounding factors that make such surveys inherently
    difficult.[2] In addition, the maps of Africa that accompany
    the Caldwell article rely on artificial boundaries (national
    boundaries and the 10 degree North parallel of latitude). This
    may overstate the actual degree of correlation.</p>

    <p>In any case, correlation indicates a statistical
    relationship only, and does not amount to causation. Caldwell
    is not sufficiently clear on this point. There is no hard
    evidence that non-circumcision directly and physically
    increases the risk of contracting and/or transmitting HIV via
    heterosexual intercourse. The majority of published studies
    have, in fact, failed to find any significant increase in risk
    amongst the noncircumcised.[2]</p>

    <p>The argument used here is essentially a process of
    elimination, an attempt to exclude other explanations for the
    observed distribution of HIV-1. However, the correlation could
    instead be due to other factors not studied or not well
    understood.</p>

    <p>The Caldwells immediately discount the hypothesis that the
    geographical distribution of AIDS in Africa may be due to the
    disease having its origins in one particular region. They
    write: "...the AIDS belt is not circular but elongated, clearly
    not the pattern of expansion from an epicenter". But this fails
    to take into account patterns of human migration, which are
    influenced by complex social factors, environmental factors and
    topography. An earlier study in Tanzania concluded that "the
    results are consistent with the spread of HIV-1 infection along
    the main roads. There is no evidence that lack of circumcision
    is a risk factor in this population."[3] Because of this and
    similar results, the center-of-origin theory remains, in the
    opinion of many researchers, the most plausible one to
    date.[2]</p>

    <p>A useful approach would be to test the hypothesis of
    causation in a random sample of individuals, all factors other
    than circumcision status being equal. Of the many studies that
    have attempted to do this, some have reported a statistically
    significant correlation between non-circumcision and HIV.[2]
    Unfortunately, though, circumcision status is highly dependent
    on cultural background and other factors that are not well
    understood; so it is difficult if not impossible to exclude all
    sources of bias from such an experiment.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, it has been suggested that female circumcision
    (or infibulation) may be a risk factor for the spread of HIV in
    sub-Saharan Africa; and male circumcision is invariably present
    in all societies that practise female circumcision.[4] Despite
    great media coverage of the issue in recent years, no mention
    of female circumcision is to be found in the Caldwell article.
    Could female and/or male genital mutilations actually
    <i>increase</i> the risk of disease? This frightening question
    warrants further study.</p>

    <p>The selection and presentation of data is misleading. For
    example, the graphs on page 66 paint a rather dramatic picture:
    HIV rates of 2.5%-13% for circumcised men, compared with
    29%-53% for intact men! But one must read another part of the
    text carefully, to realize that the two samples come from two
    very different ethnic groups in Kenya: The largely circumcised
    Kikuyu on the one hand, and the largely intact Luo on the
    other. Cultural background is a significant confounding factor
    in the correlation between non-circumcision and HIV infection.
    The most extreme from a range of statistics have presumably
    been used, in order to make the presentation appear
    convincing.</p>

    <p>In the sidebar text accompanying these graphs, it is
    written: "For uncircumcised men, thorough cleaning of the
    genitals can be particularly challenging." This may be truer in
    Africa than in developed countries; but if poor genital hygiene
    plays a role in increasing HIV risk (possibly mediated by other
    STDs such as chancroid), improving hygiene standards in Africa
    is surely the most sensible way to combat that risk. It is, by
    the way, just as easy for a man to keep his intact penis clean
    as it is for a woman to keep her intact vulva clean! Men ought
    to stand up and challenge any suggestions to the contrary.</p>

    <p>Finally, there is propaganda:</p>

    <blockquote>
      In rural southwest Tanzania, and surely elsewhere in the AIDS
      belt, uncircumcised man have not waited for agreement among
      researchers about the connection between circumcision and
      AIDS. Based on observations of their community and
      neighboring ones, they have concluded that they are at
      greater risk for AIDS than circumcised men. These men are
      appearing at hospitals in sharply increasing numbers,
      requesting circumcision for themselves and often for their
      sons. Clinics that offer adult male circumcision as a
      protection against AIDS now advertise in Tanzanian
      newspapers.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Surely an advisable strategy to controlling AIDS in Africa
    would be to make contraceptives widely available, while at the
    same time controlling widespread panic! The use of condoms is
    known to be reliable in reducing HIV risk; to suggest that
    circumcision could play this role instead is, in the reviewer's
    opinion, disingenuous in the extreme.</p>

    <p>The foreskin has a protective function, as well as sensory
    and physiological functions during sexual intercourse.[5,6] All
    male mammals have been provided with a foreskin, and any man
    possessed of his prepuce ought to be able to list some of the
    advantages to having it.</p>

    <p>Circumcision is fundamentally a social surgery, still in
    search of a medical need. The answer will not likely be found
    with HIV and AIDS. Rates of circumcision in the United States
    are declining precipitously.[7] When circumcision finally
    disappears, we will probably find it inconceivable that we ever
    did such a thing to our children, and readers of Scientific
    American in the year 2046 will be either amused or perplexed to
    see mention of the present article, in the column, "50, 100,
    150 and 200 Years Ago."</p>
