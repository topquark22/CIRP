              <p class="text1"><i>Objective.</i> To investigate the
              nature of male circumcision and its relationship to
              HIV infection.<br />
               <i>Methods.</i> Analysis of a sub-sample of 3 025
              men aged 15 years and older who participated in the
              first national populationbased survey on HIV/AIDS in
              2002. Chi-square tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests
              were used to identify factors associated with
              circumcision and HIV status, followed by a logistic
              regression model.<br />
               <i>Results.</i> One-third of the men (35.3%) were
              circumcised. The factors strongly associated with
              circumcision were age &gt;50, black living in rural
              areas and speaking SePedi (71.2%) or IsiXhosa
              (64.3%). The median age was significantly older for
              blacks (18 years) compared with other racial groups
              (3.5 years), <i>p</i> &lt;0.001. Among blacks,
              circumcisions were mainly conducted outside hospital
              settings. In 40.5% of subjects, circumcision took
              place after sexual debut; two-thirds of the men
              circumcised after their 17th birthday were
              already</p>

              <p class="text1">sexually active. HIV and
              circumcision were not associated (12.3% HIV positive
              in the circumcised group v. 12% HIV positive in the
              uncircumcised group). HIV was, however, significantly
              lower in men circumcised before 12 years of age
              (6.8%) than in those circumcised after 12 years of
              age (13.5%, <i>p</i>=0.02). When restricted to
              sexually active men, the difference that remained did
              not reach statistical significance (8.9% v. 13.6%,
              p=0.08.). There was no effect when adjusted for
              possible confounding.<br />
               <i>Conclusion.</i> Circumcision had no protective
              effect in the prevention of HIV transmission. This is
              a concern, and has implications for the possible
              adoption of the mass male circumcision strategy both
              as a public health policy and an HIV prevention
              strategy.<br />
