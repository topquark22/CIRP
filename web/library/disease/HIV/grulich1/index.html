        Circumcision and male-to-male sexual transmission of
        HIV</p>
      </div>

      <p>In recent years, evidence from observational studies in
      sub-Saharan Africa has shown that circumcised men have a
      lower risk of acquiring HIV infection than uncircumcised men.
      [<a href="#n1">1</a>]. The proposed mechanism by which the
      circumcised state might protect against HIV infection is
      twofold. First, the inner surface of the foreskin contains
      Langerhans celles, which have HIV receptors, and is also
      vulnerable to traumatic epithelial disruptions during
      intercourse. Second, an intact foreskin exposes a man to a
      greater risk of ulcerative sexually transmitted infections,
      which in themselves are a risk factor for HIV acquisition.
      The evidence that circumcision may protect against HIV
      infection is now considered strong enough that trials
      evaluating the efficacy of transmission as part of an HIV
      prevention program have been advocated [<a
      href="#n1">2</a>].</p>

      <p>Almost all of the literature suggesting that circumcision
      protects against HIV infection in men has been conducted in
      heterosexual individuals, mostly in devloping countries [<a
      href="#n3">3</a>]. We examined the relationship between
      circumcision and HIV transmission in homosexual men in
      Sydney, Australia.</p>

      <p>Between 1993 and 1999, we interviewed 74 homosexual men
      shortly after their diagnosis with newly acquired HIV
      infection. Men were asked to nominate an event of unprotected
      anal intercourse (UAI) with a serodiscordant or HIV
      status-unknown partner at which they believe they became HIV
      infected. If there was more than one such high-risk event,
      the interviewer selected the highest risk event as the
      occasion on which HIV was likely to have been transmitted.
      Participants were also asked to report all instances of UAI
      in the 6 months before seroconversion. We hypothesized that
      if the presence of the foreskin was important in HIV
      transmission, then those men who were infected by insertive
      UAI would be more likely to be uncircumcised than those
      infected by receptive UAI.</p>

      <p>Sixty-three men nominated an event of UAI as their highest
      risk activity. After clarification of the most likely
      high-risk event by the interviewer, the highest risk practice
      reported was insertive UAI in 11 men, and receptive UAI in
      52. Of the 11 men in whom insertive UAI was deemed the most
      likely mode of HIV transmission, all but one reported no
      receptive UAI in the 6 months before seroconversion (one
      reported receptive UAI with a singular regular partner who
      was definitely HIV negative). Overall, 20 men were
      uncircumcised (27%) There was no association between
      circumcision and reporting insertive UAI as the highest risk
      practice (odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval
      0.18--5.98, see Table 1). Of the additional 11 men who denied
      UAI as the event that they believed led to their infection,
      eight also denied having had UAI in the previous 6 months. Of
      these eight, three were uncircumcised. (38%).</p>

      <p>Our finding that 17% of homosexual men with newly acquired
      HIV infection reported insertive UAI as their highest risk
      activity suggests that insertive UAI is an important means of
      HIV transmission in this population. However, we found no
      association between circumcision status and infection by
      insertive UAI. In addition, men who had seroconverted despite
      no reported event of UAI were also no more likely to be
      uncircumcised. These data strongly suggest that the foreskin
      is not the main source of HIV infection in homosexual men who
      become infected by insertive UAI, and that other sites, such
      as the distal urethra, must be important in HIV
      infection.</p>

      <p>The limitations of this study are that it was based on
      relatively small numbers, and it is possible that some men
      who reported receptive UAI as their highest risk behaviour
      may have infected by insertive UAI. In addition it is
      possible that men may have been reluctant to report an event
      of receptive UAI because of its perceived social
      unacceptability.</p>

      <p>The relationship between circumcision and HIV risk has
      rarely been examined in homosexual men [<a href="#n4">4</a>].
      A cross-sectional study [<a href="#n5">5</a>] found that
      uncircumcised homosexual American men were more likely to
      have had prevalent HIV infection (adjusted odds ration 2.0,
      95% confidence interval 1.0--4.0), but it was not known
      whether these men had been infected by insertive or receptive
      intercourse.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Our data showing that there is a
      difference in the circumcision status of men infected by
      receptive or insertive UAI, in a population with a
      circumcision prevalence of approximately 75%, suggests that
      circumcision is not strongly protective against HIV infection
      in homosexual men.</span> Larger studies, preferably of
      prospective design, are needed to confirm the absence of a
      relationship between circumcision and HIV infection risk in
      gay men. In the meantime, educational messages to homosexual
      men should continue to emphasize that insertive anal sex is a
      high risk activity for HIV transmission whether or not the
      partner is circumcised.</p>
