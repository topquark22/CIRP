        <h3>Using circumcision to prevent HIV infection in
        sub-Saharan Africa: the view of an African</h3>

        <p><b>James P.M. Ntozi</b></p>

        <p><i>Department of Population Studies, Institute of
        Statistics and Applied Economics, <a
        href="http://www.makerere.ac.ug/" target="_blank">Makerere
        University</a>, Kampala, Uganda.</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">There are now two schools of thought about
      the link between lack of circumcision and HIV infection in
      Africa. One school is that of Bongaarts et al. (1989), Moses
      et al. (n.d.) and Caldwell and Caldwell (1994) who use
      geographical distribution evidence to argue that the
      association between lack of circumcision and a high level of
      HIV infection in Africa is so convincing that the likelihood
      of a link should be recognized and taken into account where
      possible in the battle against AIDS. Moses et al. (n.d.) have
      gone further to recommend circumcision interventions for
      Africa. In contrast, <a
      href="/library/disease/HIV/vincenzi/">De Vincenzi and
      Mertens</a> (1994) argue that the evidence for an
      association, at least from small-scale surveys, is doubtful
      and hence not conclusive enough to qualify circumcision as an
      intervention.</p>

      <p class="text2">My view is twofold. First, as scientists we
      should look at the existing evidence for and against the
      hypothesis that lack of circumcision is positively related to
      HIV infection. Although many studies have shown that there is
      a significant association between the two variables
      (Bongaarts et al. 1989; Moses et al. 1990; Caldwell and
      Caldwell 1994), there is no evidence of a causal relationship
      between the two. Caldwell and Caldwell (1994) pointed out
      that "Positive association does not necessarily show a direct
      causal relationship."</p>

      <p class="text2"><a href="/library/disease/HIV/vincenzi/">De
      Vincenzi and Mertens</a> (1994) make the salient point that
      most of the quoted studies were not designed to test a
      hypothesis about circumcision and did not report their
      methodological details for evaluation. They claim there is no
      evidence that enough statistical rigour was applied to the
      data and where, in small-scale studies, this was done by
      controlling for several variables like age, number of
      partners, contact with prostitutes, ethnic origin and
      birthplace, the results lost statistical significance
      (Greenblatt et al. 1988). Either those findings that did not
      fit into the conventional thinking of the hypothesis were
      rejected by the journals as not interesting, or the
      researchers did not submit them for publication for fear of
      rejection.</p>

      <p class="text2">As in the study by Serwadda et al. (1992),
      recent work on data from the 1987/88 National Survey of
      Uganda assumed Muslims to be circumcised and non-Muslim
      Ugandans not to be circumcised. This was a fair assumption
      since the cultural groups that circumcise were not included
      in the National Survey. The study shows an association at the
      bivariate analysis which disappears at the multivariate level
      (Tusingwire 1995). Perhaps the fact that the Muslims are more
      polygynous than other groups eliminates their circumcision
      advantage.</p>

      <p class="text2">Another set of Ugandan data that can be used
      is one based on our recent study of the impact of AIDS on
      families in six districts of Uganda. One of the six
      districts, Mbale, is dominated by the Bagisu, the largest of
      the few cultural groups in Uganda that circumcise boys before
      they are accepted as men in the society. Other circumcision
      groups are the Bakonjo, Sebei and Bamba in order of
      population size. Preliminary analysis of the logistic
      regression on the Bagisu data indicates that the Bagisu are
      less likely to be AIDS victims than the other six ethnic
      groups. Other cultural groups with similar results to those
      of the Bagisu are the Bakiga of the extreme southwest and the
      Banyoro of western Uganda. In contrast, the Baganda,
      Banyankore, Banyarwada and Basoga were more likely to be AIDS
      victims than the other groups combined. It is difficult to
      attribute these findings to circumcision levels in the
      cultural groups because the Bakiga and Banyoro in the former
      category do not have many circumcised people while a large
      proportion of the Basoga in the latter group are Muslims and
      circumcised. A more plausible explanation of the pattern is
      that the Bagisu, Bakiga and Banyoro are farther from the
      epicentre of the Ugandan epidemic than the other four ethnic
      groups. At this stage, it is therefore difficult for
      researchers to use the available evidence and comfortably
      recommend circumcision as a policy in combating HIV
      infection.</p>

      <p class="text2">On the other hand my second view is based on
      practical public policy arguments. As an African who has seen
      Africans perish from AIDS, it is my opinion that any measure
      which has a chance to succeed in curing AIDS, reducing the
      suffering of the people from the disease and preventing the
      infection of HIV should be tried. I believe that it was in
      this spirit that several drugs including Kemron and AZT were
      tried on many African patients, despite their known serious
      side effects. Hence, there is an urgent need to carry out
      controlled experiments in Africa on the hypothesis of
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">However, I do not agree with Caldwell and
      Caldwell (1994) when they claim that sexual behaviour is not
      changing fast, and the use of condoms is not adequate. It is
      unrealistic to expect the highly traditional societies of
      sub-Saharan Africa to change their cultures by abandoning
      their dangerous sexual customs and practices and accepting
      the alien condom faster than has so far been demonstrated.
      Brunborg, Fylkesness and Msiska (1993) have found that in
      less than a decade since the advent of AIDS, Zambian
      societies have either stopped or modified their centuries-old
      funeral rite of a brother of the deceased having sexual
      relations with all the widows.</p>

      <p class="text2">Secondly, while in 1988/89 the Uganda
      Demographic Survey reported less than one per cent of
      national condom use (Kaijuka et al. 1989), Konde-Lule (1992)
      found that 15 per cent of adolescents in Rakai district used
      the method, a multiplication by fifteen in a couple of
      years.</p>

      <p class="text2">More recently, our national study of focus
      group discussions in six districts (Ntozi and Mukiza-Gapere
      1992) found that elders and youths reported that the previous
      customary practices for marriage and death that are now
      considered dangerous because of AIDS are being abandoned or
      modified to suit the circumstances. It was found that, in
      contrast to the past situation where wives were shared by
      brothers among the Banyankore of southwest Uganda (Ntozi et
      al. 1991, study done in 1984), this custom has disappeared
      fast over less than a decade. Widow inheritance, previously
      common to most societies in Uganda, is now a thing of the
      past for fear of AIDS. The excesses in sexual activities
      practised by the Baganda of central Uganda during funeral
      rites and by the Bagisu of east Uganda during circumcision
      ceremonies, have been considerably reduced. I think the
      Africans deserve more credit for these fast socio-cultural
      changes than Caldwell and Caldwell (1994) have given
      them.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is important that, while circumcision
      interventions are being planned, several points must be
      considered carefully. <span class="yellow">If the experiment
      fails, Africans are likely to feel abused and exploited by
      scientists who recommended the circumcision policy. In a
      region highly sensitive to previous colonial exploitation and
      suspicious of the biological warfare origin of the virus,
      failure of circumcision is likely to be a big issue. Those
      recommending it should know how to handle the political
      implications.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">A second public concern will be the
      expenditure involved in conducting circumcision. If it is on
      a large scale, some international donors may divert funds
      earmarked for other social services to this exercise. It will
      also be the fear of the African governments that in the
      middle of this exercise some donors may withdraw their funds
      for political reasons or not be able to pay for the whole
      exercise including effective follow-up of the circumcision
      campaigns to ensure no side-effects are left unattended. The
      reluctance of external donors to pay fully for family
      planning activities and hence leaving many acceptors with
      side-effects untreated is fresh in African memories.
      Governments would therefore not like to start an exercise
      involving people's suffering that would not succeed with
      clear benefits to the public.</p>

      <p class="text2">Thirdly, in some societies of Uganda such as
      the Bakiga and Banyankore, a circumcised person
      (<i>owempari</i>) is culturally stigmatized. For instance,
      circumcised people or those with the foreskin not completely
      covering the penis are believed to be hot-tempered and
      unsocial. Sayings such as <i>Kunotabuka nk'owempari</i> ("You
      are as hot tempered as one circumcised") are common in these
      ethnic groups. It is considered a bad omen for parents to
      have a child with a penis half covered by the foreskin. This
      is perhaps why only a tiny proportion of the Banyankore and
      Bakiga, less than one per cent, is Muslim (Republic of Uganda
      1992). Caldwell and Caldwell (1994) suspect that it was
      difficult for Islam to be accepted by most ethnic groups that
      did not circumcise because it was considered unnatural to
      circumcise. This cultural resentment, added to the health
      issues described by De Vincenzi and Mertens (1994), may make
      some African governments reluctant to agree to participate in
      or allow the adoption of a policy of circumcision. It will,
      therefore, be important for governments in the region to
      spend a lot of money on educational campaigns before they
      take the political risk of mass circumcision. Since most
      African countries have strained economies, it will be
      difficult to find the necessary funds.</p>
