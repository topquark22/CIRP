      <p class="abstract"><b>PURPOSE:</b> Remarkable proportions of
      self-reported virgins and adolescents in eastern and southern
      Africa are infected with HIV, yet non-sexual routes of
      transmission have not been systematically investigated in
      such persons. Many observers in this region have recognized
      the potential for HIV transmission through unhygienic
      circumcision procedures. We assessed the relation between
      male and female circumcision (genital cutting) and prevalent
      HIV infection in Kenyan, Lesothoan, and Tanzanian virgins and
      adolescents.</p>

      <p class="abstract"><b>METHODS:</b> We analyzed data from
      recent cross-sectional national probability sample surveys of
      adolescents and adults in households, focusing on populations
      in which circumcision was common and usually occurred in
      puberty or later.</p>

      <p class="abstract"><b>RESULTS:</b> Circumcised male and
      female virgins were substantially more likely to be HIV
      infected than uncircumcised virgins (Kenyan females: 3.2% vs.
      1.4%, odds ratio [OR] Z 2.38; Kenyan males: 1.8% vs. 0%, OR
      undefined; Lesothoan males: 6.1% vs. 1.9%, OR 3.36; Tanzanian
      males: 2.9% vs. 1.0%, OR 2.99; weighted mean phi correlation
      Z0.07, 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.11). Among
      adolescents, regardless of sexual experience, circumcision
      was just as strongly associated with prevalent HIV infection.
      However, uncircumcised adults were more likely to be HIV
      positive than circumcised adults. Self-reported sexual
      experience was independently related to HIV infection in
      adolescent Kenyan females, but was unrelated to HIV infection
      in adolescent Kenyan, Lesothoan, and Tanzanian males.</p>

      <p class="abstract"><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> <span
      class="yellow">HIV transmission may occur through
      circumcision-related blood exposures in eastern and southern
      Africa.</span></p>
