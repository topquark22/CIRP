      <h2><b>Vaginal Drying Agents and HIV Transmission</b></h2>

      <p><b>By Karen E. Kun</b></p>
      <hr />

      <p class="abstract">Women's risk of HIV infection is largely
      influenced by biological, social and economic factors.
      Certain sexual practices, such as the use of vaginal drying
      agents, may also increase women's HIV risk when these
      practices result in genital irritation and inflammation. The
      use of vaginal drying agents has been reported in South
      Africa,<a id="n1a" name="n1a"></a><a
      href="#n1"><sup>1</sup></a> Senegal,<a id="n2a"
      name="n2a"></a><a href="#n2"><sup>2</sup></a> Zaire,
      Cameroon, Malawi, Zambia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Saudi Arabia,
      Haiti and Costa Rica.<a id="n3a" name="n3a"></a><a
      href="#n3"><sup>3</sup></a> Despite these reports, the
      international health community knows little about the
      prevalence of this practice, whether it increases the risk of
      HIV infection or how to implement culturally sensitive and
      effective educational interventions addressing the potential
      health consequences of usage.</p>

      <p class="text2">The literature on vaginal drying agent usage
      is indicative of the paucity of scientific data on sexuality,
      particularly on sexual practices. The studies published to
      date shed only minimal light on usage within the specific
      context of the society concerned. Because sexuality is
      culturally constructed,<a id="n4a" name="n4a"></a><a
      href="#n4"><sup>4</sup></a> greater understanding of the
      cultural contexts in which vaginal drying agents are used is
      essential to the development of effective interventions.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Vaginal Drying Agent Usage</b><br />
       Substances inserted into the vagina to ensure dryness and
      tightness may include stones, leaves, powders, herbs, water,
      dry cloth, antiseptics, pharmaceutical products, and tissue
      or toilet paper.<a id="n5a" name="n5a"></a><a
      href="#n5"><sup>5</sup></a> These agents are used when there
      is a cultural preference for a dry rather than a lubricated
      vagina. Reasons for this preference vary. In South Africa,
      men have reported that vaginal wetness during sexual
      intercourse is an indicator of a woman's infidelity, and have
      also associated vaginal lubrication with sexually transmitted
      diseases (STDs) and the use of contraceptives.<a id="n6a"
      name="n6a"></a><a href="#n6"><sup>6</sup></a> In Zaire, a wet
      or large vagina may be considered to be the result of a curse
      or bad luck.<a id="n7a" name="n7a"></a><a
      href="#n7"><sup>7</sup></a> In Senegal, drying agents may be
      used where there is a community belief that the vagina is not
      simply a natural part of the body, but must bear the mark of
      artistic "work."<a id="n8a" name="n8a"></a><a
      href="#n8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

      <p class="text2">Both men and women have expressed preference
      for vaginal dryness and tightness during intercourse. In
      Zaire,<a id="n9a" name="n9a"></a><a
      href="#n9"><sup>9</sup></a> as well as in Zimbabwe,<a
      id="n10a" name="n10a"></a><a href="#n10"><sup>10</sup></a> it
      is reported to increase sexual satisfaction and pleasure for
      both partners. Hence, lubrication is not considered an
      essential element in pleasurable sexual intercourse. In
      Zimbabwe, both college-educated women<a id="n11a"
      name="n11a"></a><a href="#n11"><sup>11</sup></a> and women
      who have not attended college<a id="n12a" name="n12a"></a><a
      href="#n12"><sup>12</sup></a> have reported that using
      vaginal drying agents made them "like a virgin," and that
      this enhanced their partner's sexual pleasure. Some herbs are
      also believed to "heat up the woman's body," causing heat and
      friction during intercourse and heightened male sexual
      stimulation.<a id="n13a" name="n13a"></a><a
      href="#n13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Cofactors in HIV Transmission?</b><br />
       A small number of studies have assessed whether the use of
      vaginal drying agents enhances the risk of HIV infection.
      <span class="yellow">Inconclusive evidence supports the
      existence of such a relationship. In one prospective study of
      634 seronegative women recruited from a labor ward in Lusaka,
      Zambia, for example, the practice of "dry" heterosexual
      intercourse, in which the male partner mopped the vagina dry
      with a cloth before intercourse, was associated with a higher
      risk of HIV infection.</span><a id="n14a" name="n14a"></a><a
      href="#n14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

      <p class="text2">Other researchers have focused on the
      physical effects of intravaginal substances. In Zaire, eight
      commercial sex workers recruited through the Kananga
      Department of Public Health were examined both prior to and
      after their insertion of drying agents. Among the seven women
      who used leaves as a drying agent, only one was left with an
      intact vaginal mucosa. All other women had vaginal
      inflammation that resembled a localized chemical burn or an
      allergic reaction.<a id="n15a" name="n15a"></a><a
      href="#n15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

      <p class="text2">Although this study demonstrated that drying
      agents affected the epithelium of the vagina, the hypothesis
      that the practice may be associated with an increased risk of
      HIV infection was not tested, most likely due to the small
      sample size involved. However, another study in Zaire
      involving a sample of 377 commercial sex workers recruited
      through the Kinshasha Health Department found that women who
      introduced any product into the vagina were significantly
      more likely to be infected with HIV than women who did not.<a
      id="n16a" name="n16a"></a><a
      href="#n16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

      <p class="text2">In some regions, women use drying agents not
      only for tightening, but also for self-treatment of STD
      symptoms such as itching and discharge. A survey of 3,008
      pregnant women in Malawi who reported using drying agents
      indicated an association between HIV infection and use of the
      agents to combat itching and discharge, but not use for
      tightening. The investigators concluded that STDs may play a
      role in enhancing risk of HIV infection, or that vaginal
      drying agents may be used differently for combating STD
      symptoms than for tightening, with different effects on the
      relative risk of HIV transmission.<a id="n17a"
      name="n17a"></a><a href="#n17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

      <p class="text2">The hypothesis that women may use drying
      agents differently remains unsubstantiated. Researchers
      investigating the use of drying agents among 75 HIV-positive
      and 76 HIV-negative women in Zimbabwe found no significant
      differences between the two groups' patterns of use or
      rationales for doing so. The study did find, however, that 14
      women in the HIV-positive group had used a particular herbal
      drying agent (Wankie), compared with seven in the
      HIV-negative group. The authors concluded that this and
      related substances merit further investigation as a potential
      cofactor in HIV transmission.<a id="n18a" name="n18a"></a><a
      href="#n18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

      <p class="text2">The literature does not uniformly support
      the assertion that vaginal drying practices are linked to
      increased HIV risk. A study conducted among 329 women
      attending an STD clinic at a teaching hospital in Lusaka,
      Zambia, found no direct association between the use of
      various vaginal drying agents and HIV infection. The study
      examined the ingestion of "porridge" (a liquid drink believed
      to cause vaginal drying) and the use of cloth, leaves and
      stones as potential risk factors for HIV infection. Although
      58% of the women tested positive for HIV, no individual
      vaginal drying practice showed a statistically significant
      association with HIV infection.</p>

      <p class="text2">The authors concluded that there may be no
      association between vaginal drying agent usage and increased
      risk for HIV infection, or that the association may be too
      small to be detected in the sample. In addition, the authors
      questioned whether their designation of variables as "ever
      use" and "current use" of the practices, rather than a more
      precise frequency measure, might have further biased their
      results against finding a relationship.<a id="n19a"
      name="n19a"></a><a href="#n19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

      <p class="text2">Although research has not yet conclusively
      demonstrated that use of vaginal drying agents is associated
      with an increased risk of HIV infection, such a relationship
      is plausible through numerous mechanisms.<a id="n20a"
      name="n20a"></a><a href="#n20"><sup>20</sup></a> HIV
      transmission is known to be enhanced in the presence of
      genital lesions and ulcerations.<a id="n21a"
      name="n21a"></a><a href="#n21"><sup>21</sup></a> Since
      vaginal drying agents have been documented as producing
      lesions that disrupt vaginal membrane integrity,<a id="n22a"
      name="n22a"></a><a href="#n22"><sup>22</sup></a> the practice
      may also increase the risk of HIV acquisition.</p>

      <p class="text2">Drying practices may also increase the
      likelihood of trauma and abrasions to the vagina and penis
      during intercourse because of the absence of lubrication.<a
      id="n23a" name="n23a"></a><a href="#n23"><sup>23</sup></a>
      Drying agents may cause swelling of the membranes, bruising,
      stinging and may facilitate small cuts during sexual
      intercourse that increase the risk of HIV infection.<a
      id="n24a" name="n24a"></a><a href="#n24"><sup>24</sup></a> In
      addition, intravaginal substances may alter the vaginal pH,
      which normally serves as a protective factor against HIV
      acquisition.<a id="n25a" name="n25a"></a><a
      href="#n25"><sup>25</sup></a> Drying agents may also be used
      to treat or mask vaginal discharge, which may be a symptom of
      a STD, a demonstrated cofactor in HIV transmission.<a
      id="n26a" name="n26a"></a><a
      href="#n26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Implications</b><br />
       Additional research is needed to investigate the potential
      relationship between usage of vaginal drying agents and HIV
      status, to understand the preferences and practices of dry,
      tight sex within specific cultural contexts and to
      demonstrate which substances and practices cause lesions,
      trauma during intercourse and condom disintegration.<a
      id="n27a" name="n27a"></a><a
      href="#n27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

      <p class="text2">The development of effective prevention
      efforts against HIV and STDs requires a more thorough
      understanding of different sexual preferences and practices.
      The importance of such research is underscored by one study
      of vaginal drying agent usage in which women reported that
      men were reluctant to use condoms because they prevented men
      from assessing vaginal wetness.<a id="n28a"
      name="n28a"></a><a href="#n28"><sup>28</sup></a> In addition
      to discouraging use of the male condom, the cultural
      preference for vaginal dryness may have negative implications
      for the acceptability of the female condom.<a id="n29a"
      name="n29a"></a><a href="#n29"><sup>29</sup></a> The presence
      of drying agents in the vagina prior to sexual intercourse
      may also compromise condom integrity and render the condom
      inadequate as a contraceptive or as protection against
      STDs.<a id="n30a" name="n30a"></a><a
      href="#n30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

      <p class="text2">The emphasis on dryness may influence
      women's willingness to use vaginal microbicides as well.<a
      id="n31a" name="n31a"></a><a href="#n31"><sup>31</sup></a> If
      effective microbicides are developed, they may only be
      accepted (possibly as a substitute for current dry sex
      practices) if they do not moisten the vagina to an
      unacceptable degree.<a id="n32a" name="n32a"></a><a
      href="#n32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Conclusion</b><br />
       Vaginal drying practices are part of a complex web of
      biological, economic and cultural factors that may affect
      women's risk of HIV infection and other STDs. Health
      promotion and disease prevention initiatives can only be
      effective if they take these interrelated elements into
      account. Qualitative data are therefore needed to assess and
      demonstrate the impact that these agents have on reproductive
      health initiatives for women.</p>
