      <p><b>BACKGROUND:</b> The spread of heterosexual HIV in
      developing countries is heterogeneous. Factors that explain
      the wide diversity of HIV prevalences in different countries
      are undetermined. International aid organizations currently
      appear to be focusing activities mainly on women rather than
      on men.</p>

      <p><b>GOAL:</b> To identify critical determinants
      contributing to the high rates of heterosexual HIV
      transmission in developing countries through a review of
      studies investigating HIV per-act transmission rates, and to
      discuss how these factors might be prioritized through
      HIV-prevention interventions.</p>

      <p><b>STUDY DESIGN:</b> Studies investigating the per-act HIV
      transmission rate were identified through a MEDLINE search
      and a review of the abstracts of the Annual International
      AIDS Conferences.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> When the summary mean per-act HIV
      transmission rates were calculated, the ratio of
      female-to-male HIV transmission in developing countries
      compared with that in the developed world was 341, whereas
      that for male-to-female transmission was 2.9.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b> Enhanced female-to-male HIV
      transmission in male core groups is a critical determinant of
      high-prevalence HIV epidemics among heterosexuals in
      developing countries. In addition to condom promotion, there
      is a need for an increased emphasis on HIV-prevention
      activities in men to decrease their susceptibility in
      developing countries, particularly in the countries most
      affected by the epidemic.</p>
