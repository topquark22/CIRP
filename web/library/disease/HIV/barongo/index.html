      <h2>The epidemiology of HIV-1 infection in urban areas,

      <p><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> To determine the prevalence of HIV-1
      infection and to identify the most important risk factors for
      infection.</p>

      <p><b>DESIGN:</b> A cross-sectional population survey carried
      out in 1990 and 1991 in Mwanza Region, Tanzania.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> Adults aged 15-54 years were selected from
      the region (population, 2 million) by stratified random
      cluster sampling: 2434 from 20 rural villages, 1157 from 20
      roadside settlements and 1554 from 20 urban wards. Risk
      factor information was obtained from interviews. All sera
      were tested for HIV-1 antibodies using enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA); sera non-negative on ELISA were
      also tested by Western blot.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> The response rate was 81%. HIV-1 infection
      was 1.5 times more common in women than in men; 2.5% of the
      adult population in rural villages, 7.3% in roadside
      settlements and 11.8% in town were infected. HIV-1 infection
      occurred mostly in women aged 15-34 years and men aged 25-44
      years. It was associated with being separated or widowed,
      multiple sex partners, presence of syphilis antibodies,
      history of genital discharge or genital ulcer, travel to
      Mwanza town, and receiving injections during the previous 12
      months, but not with male circumcision.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b> This study confirms that HIV-1
      infection in this region in East Africa is more common in
      women than in men. The results are consistent with the spread
      of HIV-1 infection along the main roads. <span

      is a risk factor in this population.</span></p>
