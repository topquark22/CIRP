        <h2>Routine male circumcision and risk of infection<br />
         with HIV-1 and other sexually transmitted diseases.</h2>
      </center>

      <p>Routine male circumcision as policy excites strong medical
      opinions both for and against. In the USA over 70% of all
      males have been circumcised<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      while the UK's national survey of sexual attitudes and
      lifestyles found in 1990/1 that 21% of adult males (aged
      16-59 years) reported having been circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> The percentage was 13% among those
      aged 16-24 years but 32% for those 45-49 years indicating
      that British rates have declined recently,<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> as they may also have done in the
      USA.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> Circumcision rates are
      intermediate in Canada<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> but very
      low in the Nordic countries.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>
      These large intercountry differences are not explicable on
      religious grounds.<sup><a href="#n1">1,2</a></sup> They are
      best explained on grounds of medico/social culture and
      fashion, as is the case for some other elective surgical
      procedures of uncertain effectiveness.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">The case for routine male circumcision has
      rested most firmly on the observation that rates of infant
      urinary tract infection and adult penile cancer are lower in
      circumcised males.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> However when
      weighed against the irreducible complication rates and costs
      of the procedure, these are thought insufficient grounds to
      recommend routine circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,3,7</a></sup> Recently added is the observation
      that circumcised males seem less likely to acquire infection
      with HIV-1, or other sexually transmitted diseases
      (STDs.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>) Four explanations have
      been suggested<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>: firstly that
      the exposed glans penis may develop a protective layer of
      keratin (sometimes referred to a `natural condom'); secondly
      that the foreskin may be especially vulnerable to minor
      balanitis and trauma during intercourse, allowing movement of
      HIV-1 through the dermatological barrier; thirdly that the
      warm microclimate under the foreskin may permit
      micro-organism survival increasing exposure to potential
      infections; and fourthly that lack of circumcision may
      predispose to a coinfection with other STDs that are known to
      facilitate heterosexual HIV-transmission.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Many observational studies provide data relevant
      to the relationship of HIV-1 infection and circumcision, and
      these have been the subject of two reviews and one
      meta-analysis of multiple studies within one region of an
      African country.<sup><a href="#n9">9,11,12</a></sup> The
      studies have been of types described as cross sectional or
      retrospective (observing the relative risk of being HIV-1
      infected in circumcised and uncircumcised men, or their
      female partners), prospective observational (observing the
      risk of becoming HIV-1 infected among circumcised and
      uncircumcised men), and ecological (comparing the association
      between circumcision status and prevalence of HIV-1 in
      different populations). Heterosexual partnership studies have
      also looked at sexual partners of men or women diagnosed
      HIV-1 infected in relation to the male's circumcision status.
      The reviews note the data's limitations.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9,11,12</a></sup> Most were gathered in African or
      other developing countries where incidence and prevalence of
      HIV-1 was sufficiently high to investigate possible effects
      of circumcision. None of the studies was experimental (no-one
      has dared `trial' circumcision), nor were they primarily
      designed to investigate the HIV-1 and circumcision
      relationship. Therefore many are subject to confounding
      factors and many lack optimal statistical power. That said
      most, but not all, the African studies found the risk of
      HIV-1 infection was reduced among circumcised men.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9,11,12</a></sup> The reductions were modified by
      location, social status, religion, and background HIV-1
      prevalence, but did not disappear when these factors were
      allowed for. Hence all three publications concluded that on
      balance the data supported a modestly reduced risk of
      becoming HIV infected among circumcised compared with
      uncircumcised men in areas where HIV infection was highly
      prevalent (over 1%) and mostly acquired
      heterosexually.<sup><a href="#n9">9,11,12</a></sup> The
      degree of protection varied but a commonly stated risk
      reduction was a halving for circumcised men, with a few
      studies finding greater protection. However a protective
      effect was not consistent across all studies.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9,11,12</a></sup> Whether circumcision makes the
      HIV positive more infectious to women has been investigated
      in a single study when circumcised and uncircumcised HIV
      infected Brazilian men were found to be equally infectious to
      their female partners.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">Both reviews noted the potential risk of young
      men misunderstanding their circumcisions as license for risky
      sexual behaviour.<sup><a href="#n9">9,11</a></sup> Continuing
      unsafe sex by circumcised males would still result in a
      steadily rising cumulative risk of individuals becoming
      infected and it is noticeable that being heavily circumcised
      has not prevented the USA from becoming the industrialised
      country most burdened with HIV,<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> while the opposite is true for the
      UK.<sup><a href="#n2">2,14</a></sup></p>

      <p class="2">It will be impossible to deliver safe neonatal
      male circumcision on a population basis in developing
      countries<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> and no society has
      yet shown willingness to precipitously introduce male
      circumcision on a mass scale. The relevance of the modest
      protection found in observational studies of heterosexuals in
      Africa for policy elsewhere is unclear, especially for the
      USA and Europe where homosexual transmission is relative more
      important.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> There are
      seemingly few data on risk of HIV-1 among circumcised as
      compared with uncircumcised homosexual men.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9,11</a></sup> It is unclear whether circumcision
      protects against other STDs as data are conflicting according
      to which STD and the population under study.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,16,17</a></sup> The UK national survey found no
      difference in rates of STD clinic attendance among
      circumcised and uncircumcised men.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> This suggests that any protective
      effect against HIV-1 in industrialized countries is small and
      many circumcisions would be needed to prevent a single HIV
      infection in an American or European setting.</p>

      <p class="2">Cost-benefit analysis for non-HIV and STD
      benefits have concluded routine circumcision would be
      uneconomic.<sup><a href="#n1">1,18</a></sup> Cadman et al
      calculated that the cost of circumcising 100 000 male infants
      would be &pound;1.74 million at 1983 prices in Canada.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> Projecting this to the UK in 1997
      (375 000 male births annually) with 4% annual medical
      inflation<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> and assuming 13% of
      males will already be circumcised<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> this would translate to an additional
      annual cost of &pound;9.83 million at Canadian prices. Given
      that this would require at least 15 years of investment
      before any benefit it seems unlikely that prevention of HIV
      and other STDs is going to change the economic balance
      towards a procircumcision policy.</p>
