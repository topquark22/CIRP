        <h2>Concern voiced over "dry sex" practices in South
        Africa</h2>

        <p class="text1"><font size="+3">A</font> traditional
        southern African sexual practice&mdash;dry sex&mdash;aimed
        at pleasing men, could promote the spread of HIV-1,
        researchers warn.</p>

        <p class="text2">Many women in the region willingly insert
        herbal aphrodisiacs, household detergents, and antiseptics
        into their vaginas before sex, to ensure they are "hot,
        tight, and dry". This is the way their men like them, they
        say. The agents increase friction during sex and although
        painful for women, they are prepared to forego their own
        pleasure to ensure their partners return to them.</p>

        <p class="text2">South Africa has one of the fastest
        growing rates of HIV-1 infection in the world, prompting
        Deputy Presidend Thabo Mebeki's address to the nation on
        October 9, when he launched a multisectorial anti-AIDS
        campaign. In the live broadcast, Mbeki said that more than
        3 million people are infected with HIV-1 in South Africa
        and 1500 people are infected each day.</p>

        <p class="text2">Neetha Morar (<a
        href="http://www.mrc.ac.za/home.html"
        target="_blank">Medical Research Council</a>, Durban) says
        dry sex has been reported in many countries. Zairean women
        reports the use of traditional substances to tighten the
        vagina before intercourse. A study in Zambia found that 86%
        of women interviewed practices dry sex.</p>

        <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Phillip Kubukeli,
        President of the Herbalists and Spiritual Healers
        Association in the Western Cape, says the use of dry sex is
        most prevalent in Kwazulu-Natal, which has the highest
        incidence of HIV/AIDS.</span></p>

        <p class="text2">In the first descriptive study of its kind
        in South Africa, Norar found dry sex to be prevalent among
        prostitutes in the midlands of Kwazulu-Natal. At least 80%
        of a group of 150 prostitutes aged between 15 and 45 years
        who work at truck stops favour high, tight, and dry sex.
        Competition is tough and it is imperative the men return to
        them for economic reasons. One woman explains: "men do not
        like loose vaginas. If sex is wet the man thinks that I
        have had sex with someone else and then he won't pay
        me."</p>

        <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Morar say the
        substances used by the women could cause disruption of
        membranes lining the vaginal and uterine wall. In addition,
        excessive drying could lead to abrasive trauma during
        sexual intercourse.</span> She says the study indicates the
        need for urgent public-health intervention in the women who
        use drying techniques, especially since the effective use
        of condoms may be compromised by intravaginal substance
        use.</p>
