      <h2>Dry and tight: sexual practices and potential AIDS risk
      in Zaire</h2>
      <b>Brown JE, Ayowa OB, Brown RC</b> 

      <p>Institut Medical Chretien du Kasai,<br />
       Kananga,<br />
       Zaire.</p>

      <p>Both men and women in central Zaire like a 'dry, tight'
      vagina because it increases pleasure during sexual
      intercourse. In focus group interviews, they described wiping
      and washing procedures, as well as 30 different substances,
      mostly leaves and powders, that women can insert into the
      vagina to produce the desired effects. Women who use leaves
      said they crush them, insert them for several hours, then
      remove them before intercourse. Women who insert powders
      leave them in place during intercourse. Individual interviews
      with 99 women (half of them unmarried prostitutes and half
      married women) showed that over one-third of each group had
      used intravaginal drying or tightening substances at some
      time. Vaginal examinations by a physician revealed that
      several of the substances cause inflammatory lesions of the
      vagina and cervix. Furthermore, some products cause extreme
      dryness that could foster epithelial trauma during coitus,
      both for the woman and for her partner. Breaks in the
      epithelium may promote the passage of organisms that cause
      AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases. Thus the sexual
      practices of drying and tightening the vagina may be
      increasing the risk of infection.</p>
