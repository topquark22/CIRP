        <b>Objective</b> To investigate the association between
        alcohol consumption and HIV sero-positivity in a rural
        Ugandan population. 

        <p><b>Methods</b> The adult population residing in a
        cluster of 15 neighbouring villages has been kept under
        epidemiological surveillance for HIV infection using annual
        censuses and sero-surveys since 1989. At the eighth annual
        survey all respondents were asked about their history of
        alcohol consumption, the sale of alcohol in their
        household, and other socio-demographic information. After
        informed consent, blood was drawn for HIV serology.</p>

        <p><b>Results</b> Of the total adult population 3279 (60%)
        were interviewed; 48% were males; 905 (27%) had not started
        sexual activity and were excluded from further analysis. Of
        the remaining 2374, 8% were HIV infected, 57% had ever
        drunk alcohol, and 4% lived in households where alcohol was
        sold. Living in a household where alcohol was sold was
        associated with a history of having ever drunk alcohol (OR
        2.9, 95% CI : 1.7-4.8). HIV prevalence among adults living
        in households selling alcohol was 15% compared with 8%
        among those living in households not selling alcohol (OR
        2.0, 95% CI : 1.1-3.6). Individuals who had ever drunk
        alcohol experienced an HIV prevalence twice that of those
        who had never drunk, 10% versus 5% (OR 2.0, 95% CI :
        1.5-2.8). This association remained after adjusting for
        potential confounders including sale of alcohol in the
        household and Muslim religion (OR 1.8, 95% CI : 1.2-2.7).
        Only age, marital status and having ever drunk alcohol
        independently predicted HIV sero-positivity in a logistic
        regression model.</p>

        <p><b>Conclusions</b> We have demonstrated an association
        between a history of alcohol consumption and being HIV
        sero-positive. This unexplored factor may explain in part
        the observed lower prevalence of HIV infection among
        Muslims. Public health campaigns need to stress the
        relationship between HIV and alcohol.</p>
