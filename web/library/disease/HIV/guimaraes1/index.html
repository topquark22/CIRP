      <h2>HIV infection among female partners of seropositive men

      <p>A heterosexual partner study was carried out in Rio de
      Janeiro, Brazil, from August 1990 to December 1991. The main
      objectives were to determine the rate of male-to-female
      transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and to
      determine risk factors. Male index cases were recruited
      according to the following criteria: 1) confirmed HIV
      positivity, 2) 18 years old or older; 3) heterosexual contact
      within the past year. Only female partners who reported not
      to have other risk factors but to have had sexual contact
      with the index case were invited to participate. Couples were
      interviewed for risk factors and had blood collected for
      laboratory studies. The overall prevalence of HIV infection
      was 45 percent among 204 female partners in the study. Using
      logistic regression, the authors found the following factors
      to be independently (p &lt; 0.05) associated with HIV
      infection: 1) anal sex (odds ratio (OR) = 3.74, 95%
      confidence interval (CI) 1.87-7.45); 2) condom use during
      vaginal sex sometimes (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.07-1.96), rarely
      (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.15-3.83), or never (OR = 3.04, 95% CI
      1.23- 7.50) as compared with always; 3) frequency of sexual
      contacts in the year prior to interview (100+) (OR = 2.00,
      95% CI 1.03-3.91); and 4) oral contraceptive use (OR = 2.04,
      95% CI 0.97-4.29). In addition to a borderline significance
      of oral contraceptive use, there was a strong suggestion of
      an interaction with history of sexually transmitted
      diseases.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: This study shows that the female
      partners of circumcised men had a higher rate of HIV
      infection, however, the increase was not considered to be
      statistically significant.]</p>

      <p class="cirp">[Table 2 on page 543 shows that 43 percent of
      female partners seroconverted when the male partner was not
      circumcised, however, when the male partner was circumcised,
      57 percent of female partners seroconverted.]</p>
