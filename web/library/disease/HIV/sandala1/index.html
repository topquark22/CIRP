      <h2>'Dry sex' and HIV infection among women attending a
      sexually transmitted diseases clinic in Lusaka, Zambia.</h2>
      <b>Sandala L, Lurie P, Sunkutu MR, Chani EM, Hudes ES, Hearst

      <p>Department of Dermato-Venereology,<br />
       University Teaching Hospital,<br />
       Lusaka, Zambia.</p>

      <p><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> To describe 'dry sex' practices
      intended to decrease vaginal secretions and to determine
      whether these practices are related to HIV infection.</p>

      <p><b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS:</b> A cross-sectional study was
      conducted in a sexually transmitted diseases clinic in a
      teaching hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. The subjects comprised
      329 women aged 15-50 years presenting consecutively for an
      initial evaluation of sexually transmitted disease symptoms.
      Dry sex practices were assessed by questionnaire, and
      serological testing for HIV antibodies was performed.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> <span class="yellow">Fifty percent of
      women had engaged in at least one dry sex practice.</span>
      The most common practices were drinking 'porridge' (a liquid
      or suspension believed to cause drying of the vagina; 28%),
      removing vaginal secretions with a cloth (22%) and placing
      leaves in the vagina (11%). The most frequent reasons given
      for drinking porridge were to increase the partner's sexual
      enjoyment and to tighten the vagina, while cleaning the
      vagina was mentioned often by those using cloth or leaves.
      Swelling or peeling of the vagina was reported by
      approximately 10% of women using cloth or leaves. Overall,
      the HIV seroprevalence in the sample was 58%. In bivariate
      analysis, no practice was statistically significantly
      associated with HIV infection. Multiple logistic regression
      had little impact on these findings.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Although a variety of practices with
      potential relevance to HIV transmission were reported, there
      was no evidence in this study population of a strong
      relationship between these practices and HIV infection. Women
      should be counseled about the potential risks of these
      practices, but <span class="yellow">prevention efforts should
      continue to emphasize measures of known effectiveness,
      particularly limiting the numbers of sexual partners,
      consistently using condoms and obtaining appropriate
      treatment for sexually transmitted diseases.</span></p>
