      <h1>Circumcision and HIV infection</h1>

      <p>In recent years, many articles have appeared in the
      literature that have examined the relationship between
      circumcision status and the risk of contracting human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This page introduces
      abstracts, full text articles, and other material about this
      relationship. The materials are indexed in chronological
      order.</p>

      <p>Whether circumcision status plays a role in HIV risk or
      not, it is important to recognize that HIV can be prevented
      through several known very effective means, such as condom
      use, and limiting exposure to multiple partners. Rather than
      advocating circumcision, given the existing evidence, it
      would be appropriate to advocate better public health
      education, so that individuals can make appropriate decisions
      regarding their own sexual behavior.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, the consideration of circumcision with regard
      to STD and AIDS prevention does not apply to children. Kept
      intact from birth, they can weigh the issue for themselves
      when they are old enough to consent. A vaccine may even be
      available by the time they reach adulthood!</p>

      and STD</a>)</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The debate over circumcision status and HIV in the medical
      literature was started in 1986, when the <i>New England
      Journal of Medicine</i> published a letter from the late
      Aaron J. Fink, MD.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Fink was a
      California urologist, an outspoken advocate of circumcision
      who had self-published a book to promote his ideas about
      circumcision. Fink maintained that the foreskin "increased
      infection by HIV." Fink claimed that the keratinization of
      the penis of the circumcised male reduced the chance of HIV
      penetration. There is little direct evidence to support this
      claim.</p>

      <p>A flurry of studies have appeared in recent years
      concerning Fink's idea, many having contradictory
      conclusions. This has led to an ongoing debate in the medical
      literature that has yet to be resolved.</p>

      <h3>Studies from Africa</h3>

      <p>A number of studies from Africa point to the fact that the
      regions of Africa most troubled with HIV infection tend to
      overlap with the regions where male circumcision is rare.
      However, this does not imply a causal link: If the same
      argument were applied to the industrialized world, one would
      note that the United States has a high circumcision rate, and
      also has the highest prevalence of HIV.<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a>,<a href="#n31">31</a>,<a
      href="#n32">32</a> <a href="#n38">38</a></sup> Circumcision
      alone cannot explain these differences. Furthermore, the
      applicability of data from Africa vis-&agrave;-vis the
      conditions in developed countries&mdash;where hygiene
      standards, prevalence of different STDs, and strains of HIV
      differ greatly&mdash;is questionable. Rather, these variances
      can be explained by looking at cultural differences and
      sexual practices.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, this subject has received an unbalanced
      treatment in the popular and scientific press. For example,
      in February 1996, <i>Scientific American</i> printed an
      article by two Australian researchers, JC Caldwell and P
      Caldwell, based on the apparent correlation between HIV
      infection and non-circumcised populations in Africa. Their
      retrospective analysis did not examine any patients.
      Furthermore, <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/vincenzi/">de
      Vincenzi and Mertens (<i>AIDS</i>, 1994)</a> had, two years
      previously, criticized the design of such studies;<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> and although this fact was pointed
      out in at least two letters to the editor, the magazine chose
      to edit the letters severely for publication. The Caldwells
      were also allowed a rebuttal that did not address the
      criticisms. See the original complete (unpublished) <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/fleiss/">Fleiss
      and Hodges (1996)</a> and <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/falk/">Falk
      (1996)</a>.</p>

      <p>A 2013 <a href="/news/kenyandailypost2013-09-11/">survey
      from Kenya</a> indicates that mass circumcision programs
      in that country are in fact exacerbating the HIV situation
      instead of alleviating it, as many had hoped.</p>

      <p>In one recent study, Baeten et al.<sup><a
      href="#n75">75</a></sup> reported a small increased risk of
      HIV-1 acquisition in intact vs. circumcised truck drivers in
      Kenya. This study followed a cohort of 745 long-distance
      truck drivers. Subjects self-reported their sexual behavior
      at quarterly intervals over a 1&ndash;2 year period. Commonly
      reported behaviors included multiple partnerships, failure to
      use condoms, and contact with prostitutes. This study
      concluded that circumcision status "may explain the rapid
      spread of the HIV epidemic in settings, found throughout much
      of Africa, in which multiple partnerships and a lack of male
      circumcision are common."</p>

      <p>Baeten <i>et al.</i> estimated that the rate of HIV-1
      infection amongst prostitutes frequented by working-class men
      in Kenya is 60-65%.<sup><a href="#n75">75</a></sup> During
      the course of the study, 43 of the 745 men experienced
      seroconversion to HIV-1. It is important to point out that
      HIV can be prevented through several known very effective
      means, such as condom use, and limiting exposure to multiple
      partners. Rather than advocating universal circumcision (as
      some have done), it would be more appropriate to advocate
      better public health education in African countries regarding
      these issues.</p>

      <p><b>Self-reporting</b> is an unreliable means of collecting
      data on sexual behavior. For instance, Baeten et al.<sup><a
      href="#n75">75</a></sup> relied on self-reporting of sexual
      behavior in a group of 745 truck drivers in Kenya. This study
      was designed to investigate female-to-male HIV transmission.
      Over the study duration, none (0) of the subjects reported
      having had a sexual contact with another man. As this is
      rather implausible, given the size of the study group,
      studies based on self-reporting must be seen as questionable
      at best.</p>

      <p><b>Demographic assumptions.</b> Many of the African
      studies did not directly verify the circumcision status of
      the study subjects. The circumcision status was guessed based
      on tribal or religious affiliation. Without actually
      examining the patients to determine their circumcision
      status, obviously, it is impossible to get valid results.</p>

      <p><b>Statistical significance.</b> Most of those studies
      that claimed a positive correlation between circumcision and
      reduced HIV incidence had a small sample size. If there had
      been only a small number of misclassifications of
      circumcision status (<b>Demographic assumptions</b>), the
      results of those studies are not statistically
      significant.</p>

      <p><b>Publication bias.</b> Studies claiming a positive link
      between circumcision and reduced HIV incidence are more
      likely to be published than studies that found no
      correlation. Publication bias is a common phenomenon across
      the medical literature: Studies finding a positive result are
      "more interesting" to journals and therefore more likely to
      be published. Publication bias unfairly distorts the true
      significance of circumcision vis-&agrave;-vis HIV
      infection.</p>

      <p><b>"Dry sex."</b> Studies from Zimbabwe,<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a>,<a href="#n19">19</a>,<a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup> Zaire,<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup>, Malawi,<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> Zambia,<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup> The Central African Republic,<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup> and South Africa<sup><a
      href="#n40">40</a>,<a href="#n46">46</a></sup> have
      documented the popular practice of drying and/or tightening
      the vagina by various methods of douching and/or application
      of leaves and powders to absorb the vaginal lubrication. Dry
      sex is a pervasive practice in sub-Saharan Africa. This
      practice is purported to increase sexual pleasure.</p>

      <p>Reports indicate that dry sex dramatically increases HIV
      infection risk. Several reports document that dry sex causes
      various problems with condom usage.<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a>,<a href="#n20">20</a>,<a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup> Dry sex is associated with an
      increased report of STDs in men.<sup><a
      href="#n48">48</a></sup> Several studies report increased HIV
      incidence among women.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a>,<a
      href="#n13">13</a>,<a href="#n30">30</a>,<a
      href="#n39">39</a></sup> Vaginal dryness is associated with
      increased lesions,<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>
      lacerations,<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> peeling of the
      vagina,<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup>, chlamydial
      infection,<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup> and epithelial
      trauma in both male and female,<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> thus creating a portal of entry for
      HIV.</p>

      <p>Because of this increased risk, dry sex is an obvious
      confounding factor in any study of HIV seroconversion vs.
      circumcision in sub-Saharan Africa. However, all of the
      approximately forty existing studies have ignored this
      potential confounding factor.</p>

      <p><b>Genital ulcer disease (GUD).</b> Genital ulcer disease,
      endemic in parts of Africa, is a very strong risk factor for
      HIV infection.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a>,<a
      href="#n12">12</a>,<a href="#n17">17</a>,<a
      href="#n35">35</a></sup> <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/pepin/">P&eacute;pin</a>
      reported that HIV positive males often have pre-existing
      genital ulcers of an untreated STD other than HIV.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> It is believed that these lesions
      may provide an entry point for the HIV virus. <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/ofarrell3/">O'Farrell</a>
      found that Zulu men with bleeding genital ulcers often
      continue to have sexual intercourse with women, including
      prostitutes.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/STD/kaul1/">Kaul et
      al.</a> reported on the prevalence of GUD in female sex
      workers in Kenya, noting that many prostitutes continue to
      work despite having the disease.<sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup> Therefore, the presence of GUD
      becomes a significant confounding factor in any study that
      attempts to make meaningful conclusions about the
      relationship between circumcision status and HIV
      susceptibility.</p>

      <p><b>Female circumcision.</b> <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/hrdy1/">Hrdy</a>
      identified female circumcision as a possible contributing
      factor to the spread of HIV in 1987.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/brady1/">Brady</a>
      has done the same in 1999.<sup><a href="#n49">49</a></sup>
      However, the effect of female circumcision, common in parts
      of Africa, on the reception and transmission of HIV has not
      been studied. Not one study (as far as we are aware) has been
      done to determine the effect of female circumcision on HIV
      transmission/reception; although more than 40 African studies
      of the effects of male circumcision have been carried out.
      All existing studies of the effects of male circumcision on
      HIV transmission/reception (as far as we are aware) lacked
      controls for the effects of female circumcision. Female
      circumcision is a potential confounding factor of unknown
      magnitude in the study of the effects of male circumcision on
      HIV transmission/reception. No published studies control for
      female circumcision.</p>

      <p><b>Cross-cultural comparisons.</b> Since circumcision
      status is a cultural marker,<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup>
      circumcising and noncircumcising tribes may differ markedly
      in cultural mores, sexual behavior and in other ways.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> These and other such confounding
      factors make meaningful cross-cultural comparisons
      essentially impossible.</p>

      <p><b>Viral load.</b> Recent studies report that viral load
      is a major factor in the transmission of HIV.<sup><a
      href="#n50">50</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n51">51</a></sup>
      This is in itself a major confounding factor.<sup><a
      href="#n59">59</a></sup> Most studies of HIV infection failed
      to control for viral load.<sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup>
      <sup><a href="#n68">68</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>High Risk populations.</b> Many of the African studies
      used unrepresentative high-risk sample populations, such as
      clients of prostitutes, or visitors to a
      sexually-transmitted-disease clinic. Unfortunately, such
      groups do not represent a balanced sample of the population
      in terms of sexual behavior, general health and other
      factors.</p>

      <p><b>Male-to-female transmission.</b> Two studies report
      that partner circumcision is a risk factor for female
      sero-conversion.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>Rebuttals.</b> Van Howe and Storms have raised a number
      of plausible arguments that imposing circumcision in Africa will
      <i>increase</i> the number of HIV infections by diverting
      attention and resources away from more effective
      interventions. <sup><a href="#n95">95</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>Psycho-cultural factors.</b> The AIDS researchers who
      propose that circumcision can prevent HIV transmission are
      overwhelmingly, white, male, and the products of
      English-speaking nations where male circumcision was once the
      usual practice. Females are seldom, if ever, represented.
      Male researchers from nations that do not practice male
      circumcision are usually not amongst those who advocate
      circumcision to prevent HIV transmission. There are few, if
      any, South American, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, European, or
      Scandinavian males amongst those who advocate male
      circumcision to prevent HIV transmission.</p>

      <p>In a comparison of studies performed by European
      vis-&agrave;-vis those performed by white male
      English-speaking researchers, the studies by white male
      English-speaking researchers have been more likely to report
      a protective effect for male circumcision. In the absence of
      another logical explanation for this effect, it is possible
      to conclude that the circumcision status of the researcher(s)
      may influence the conclusions of their studies.<sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup></p>

      <p>Male circumcision is common in North America, but uncommon
      in most of Europe. In a survey, <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/general/laumann/">Laumann</a>
      reported that 77% of adult American men were
      circumcised.<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup> <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/psych/goldman1/#doctors">Goldman</a>
      explains why doctors from circumcising cultures may tend to
      overstate the purported benefits of circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n41">41</a></sup> Goldman states:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">"Among physicians, support for
        circumcision has been based on supposed 'rational' factors,
        but as psychiatrist Wilhelm Reich wrote, 'Intellectual
        activity has often a structure and direction that it
        impresses one as an extremely clever apparatus precisely
        for the avoidance of facts, as an activity which distracts
        from reality.' This appears to have been the case in those
        advocating circumcision. Science has been adopted as the
        great arbiter between fact and fiction. This systematic
        approach to evaluating experience is of value, especially
        as research has shown that a surprising number of adults do
        not reason logically. The scientific method is designed to
        help protect the scientific community and the public
        against flawed reasoning, but it is the flawed reasoning of
        supposedly reputable scientific studies that has
        contributed to the confusion on the circumcision
        issue.<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup></font></p>

        <p><font size="2">"One reason that flawed studies are
        published is that science is affected by cultural values. A
        principal method of preserving cultural values is to
        disguise them as truths that are based on scientific
        research. This 'research' can then be used to support
        questionable and harmful cultural values such as
        circumcision. This explains the claimed medical 'benefits'
        of circumcision."<sup><a
        href="#n41">41</a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      Goldman concludes: 

      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">"Long-term psychological effects
        associated with circumcision can be difficult to establish
        because the consequences of early trauma are only rarely,
        and under special circumstances, recognizable to the person
        who experienced the trauma. However, lack of awareness does
        not necessarily mean that there has been no impact on
        thinking, feeling, attitude, behaviour and functioning,
        which are often closely connected. In this way, an early
        trauma can alter a whole life, whether or not the trauma is
        consciously remembered.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">"Defending circumcision requires
        minimizing or dismissing the harm and producing overstated
        medical claims about protection from future harm. The
        ongoing denial requires the acceptance of false beliefs and
        misunderstandings of facts. These psychological factors
        affect professionals, members of religious groups and
        parents involved in the practice. Cultural conformity is a
        major force perpetuating non-religious circumcision, and to
        a greater degree, religious circumcision. The avoidance of
        guilt and the reluctance to acknowledge the mistake and all
        that that implies help to explain the tenacity with which
        the practice is defended."<sup><a
        href="#n41">41</a></sup></font></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The effect of birth-cultural factors on the
      HIV-prevents-circumcision literature should not be
      underestimated.<sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup> The failure
      of the researchers to investigate the confounding effects of
      female circumcision, "dry sex", and other African cultural
      practices is instructive.</p>

      <p>See <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/psych/">Psychological
      Impacts of Circumcision</a> for more information.</p>

      <h4>Unsafe Health Care</h4>

      <p>A group of HIV researchers strongly argue that the major
      cause of HIV infection in Africa is unsafe health care,
      especially non-sterile injections. They have published
      letters and articles in the HIV/AIDS medical literature to
      build their case. Some are available on line.<sup><a
      href="#n62">62-66</a></sup> Three companion articles were
      published in the <i>International Journal of STD &amp;
      AIDS</i><sup><a href="#n64">64-66</a></sup> Only about 30
      percent of the HIV epidemic in Africa would be attributed to
      heterosexual contacts.<sup><a href="#n65">65</a></sup> Most
      apparently is caused by unsafe medical procedures. If their
      hypothesis is correct, then a large number of studies (trying
      to prove that intact men with normal anatomy are the reason
      for the high incidence of HIV infection in Africa) would be
      invalidated. See the article <a
      href="http://www.rsm.ac.uk/new/pr126.htm"
      target="_blank">"Unsafe Health Care Drives Spread of African
      HIV"</a> at the Royal Society of Medicine website for more
      information. Even if the claims for circumcision to prevent
      the transmission/reception of HIV were true, a program of
      male circumcision could only affect a small portion of the
      one-third of infections caused by heterosexual contact.
      Introduction of a program of male circumcision in Africa in
      an effort to reduce the spread of HIV risks would expose
      African males to unsafe health care procedures and may
      actually increase the transmission/reception of the
      virus.</p>

      <h3>Studies from developed countries</h3>

      <p>According to <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/general/laumann/">Laumann
      <i>et al.</i></a>, (1997) data from the National Health and
      Social Life Survey in the United States indicate that, in
      1992, of 1511 men surveyed who were between 18 and 59 years
      of age, 77 percent of U.S. born men were circumcised; this
      high percentage is unique among the industrialized nations.
      Laumann found "no discernible differences" with regard to
      STDs between circumcised and non-circumcised men.<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup></p>

      <p>Dave <i>et al.</i> (2003) studied British males. Dave
      <i>et al.</i> found slightly more viral infection in
      circumcised males but the difference was not considered
      significant.<sup><a href="#n72">72</a></sup></p>

      <p>Richters <i>et al.</i> (2006) studied Australian males.
      Although most Australian males born after 1980 in this study
      were non-circumcised, the incidence of HIV infection (0.1%)
      was too low to permit statistical analysis.<sup><a
      href="#n76">76</a></sup></p>

      <p>The United States HIV incidence rate is 3.5 times higher
      than that of the closest advanced industrialized nation. <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/general/storms/">Storms</a>
      <sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup> and <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/nicoll/">Nicoll</a>
      <sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup> noted that the high
      incidence of male circumcision in the US did nothing to
      prevent the spread of this infection. Nicoll, in fact, states
      that "the US is the industrialized country most burdened with
      HIV."<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup></p>

      <p>These observations should not necessarily lead us to
      conclude that circumcision increases HIV risk. However, it
      does suggest that attempts to control HIV by imposing mass
      circumcision on populations are unlikely to be
      successful.</p>

      <p><b>Sociocultural confounding factors.</b> <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/general/poland/">Poland</a>
      makes it clear that circumcision is not performed at random.
      Circumcision is a socio-cultural marker that may indicate
      wide differences in social and cultural practices among
      different groups and tribes. For example, circumcision
      incidence in the U.S. is lower among poor and Hispanic
      people.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> Circumcision (and,
      conversely, intactness) are socioeconomic indicators that may
      relate to differences in sexual behavior, hygienic behavior,
      and access to medical care. Failure to control for these
      confounding factors is a frequent source of error in such
      studies.</p>

      <p><b>Circumcision changes sexual behavior.</b> Circumcised
      men have a greater tendency to engage in riskier, "more
      highly elaborated" sexual practices.<sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup> Such behavior includes unsafe sex
      (less frequent use of condoms, which deaden sensation even
      more for circumcised men; anal sex, or sex with multiple
      partners). This may contribute to the high rate of HIV
      infection in the United States, where circumcision rates are
      still of epidemic proportions.</p>

      <p><b>Other factors.</b> <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/STD/hooykaas1/">Hooykaas</a>
      reported more STDs amongst circumcised men in the
      Netherlands.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/pepin/">P&eacute;pin</a>
      has identified pre-existing lesions from STDs as entry points
      for HIV.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <h3>The protective effect of the natural anatomy</h3>

      <p>In 1982, <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/prakash/">Prakash
      and colleagues</a> reported finding lytic material (lysozyme)
      in the sub-preputial wetness beneath the prepuce.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> Lysozyme is an enzyme secreted in
      human bodily fluids that acts to destroy bacteria, fungi, and
      other infectious agents. Bacteria are capable of producing
      lesions through which the HIV virus can enter the body.
      Lysozyme has long been known to destroy the cell walls of
      bacteria. <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/STD/fleiss3/">Fleiss
      et al.</a> have elaborated the natural protective properties
      of the prepuce. Compellingly, <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/lee-huang/">Lee-Huang
      and colleagues</a> reported in 1999 that lysozyme is an
      effective agent for killing HIV directly <i>in
      vitro</i>.<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup> <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/hill1/">Hill</a>
      has prepared a summary of the evidence for the hypothesis
      that the intact prepuce may offer a protective effect against
      HIV infection.</p>

      <p>The effectiveness of lysozyme at destroying HIV in or on
      the body has not been tested. More research is needed to
      establish what direct protection, if any, is afforded by the
      lysozyme found in the subpreputial wetness of the
      anatomically complete penis as designed by nature.</p>

      <p><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/STD/fleiss3/">Fleiss,
      Hodges and Van Howe</a> describe the immunological
      protections that the foreskin provides against
      infection.<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> In another review,
      <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/vanhowe4/">Van
      Howe</a> found that men with circumcised penises were at
      statistically greater risk of acquiring HIV than a man with a
      non-circumcised penis.<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup> This
      is consistent with the results of <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/dezzutti/">Dezzutti</a>,
      who discovered that intact epithelium (skin and mucosa) is
      resistant to penetration by HIV.<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup> The possible role of circumcision in
      the high rate of HIV infection in the US needs further
      study.</p>

      <h3>Meta-analyses</h3>

      <p><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/vincenzi/">de
      Vincenzi and Mertens</a> found that the existing evidence did
      not control sufficiently for confounding factors concerning
      the relationship between circumcision and HIV
      infection.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> They warned that
      caution was necessary: Implementing surgery as a strategy for
      controlling the spread of AIDS was not recommended based on
      the existing evidence.</p>

      <p><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/vanhowe4/">Van
      Howe</a> also concluded that circumcision could not be
      recommended to prevent HIV infection.<sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup> This conclusion was based on a
      statistical analysis of all of the data from multiple
      published studies. In fact, the analysis indicated that
      circumcised men had a slightly <i>greater</i> chance of
      contracting HIV.</p>

      <p><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/nicoll/">Angus
      Nicoll</a> of the British Communicable Disease Surveillance
      Centre recommended that circumcision <i>should not</i> be
      used to control HIV infection.<sup><a
      href="#n32">32</a></sup></p>

      <h3>Medical Society Reports</h3>

      <p>The Fetus and Newborn Committee of the <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm#SEXUALLY%20TRANSMITTED%20DISEASES">
      Canadian Paediatric Society</a> examined the data, and
      concluded that more study would be necessary before a
      recommendation for circumcision could be made.<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup></p>

      <p>The Task Force on Circumcision of the American Academy of
      Pediatrics examined the issue with the help of an
      epidemiologist. The task force concluded in its official <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999#STD">Circumcision
      Policy Statement</a> that "behavioral factors appear to be
      far more important risk factors in the acquisition of HIV
      infection than circumcision status."<sup><a
      href="#n45">45</a></sup></p>

      <p>The Council on Scientific Affairs of the American Medical
      Association has also examined the issue. The Council on
      Scientific Affairs stated, in a report titled <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/"><i>Report
      10: Neonatal Circumcision</i></a>, that "...behavioral
      factors are far more important risk factors for acquisition
      of HIV and other sexually transmissible diseases than
      circumcision status, and circumcision cannot be responsibly
      viewed as 'protecting' against such infections."<sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup></p>

      <h3>Cochrane Review</h3>

      <p>The Cochrane Library established a protocol for the review
      of the HIV/Circumcision literature. That review notes the
      cultural bias of circumcision researchers. that review also
      expresses concern about the negative effects of circumcision
      on efforts to effect behavioural change.<sup><a
      href="#n59">59</a></sup> The systematic review reported a
      general failure to control for confounding factors and, in
      addition, found insufficient evidence to recommend male
      circumcision to control HIV infection and
      transmission.<sup><a href="#n68">68</a></sup></p>

      <h3>Conclusions</h3>

      <p>Confounding factors to the study of the relationship of
      HIV infection to male circumcision include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>female circumcision</li>

        <li>"dry sex"</li>

        <li>genital ulcer disease</li>

        <li>other STDs</li>

        <li>unsafe medical practices</li>

        <li>viral load</li>

        <li>religion</li>

        <li>culture</li>

        <li>education, occupation, and socio-economic status</li>

        <li>condom use</li>

        <li>migration status</li>

        <li>age</li>

        <li>location of the study</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The Cochrane Review found that the existing studies fail
      to control for most of these confounding factors so the
      evidence produced is unreliable. After more than forty
      studies over a span of time greater than a decade, the Fink
      hypothesis that circumcision somehow reduces HIV infection
      remains unproven. <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/ntozi1/">Ntozi</a>
      recognizes that this idea that circumcision can reduce HIV
      infection is only a hypothesis, but would like to see a
      controlled study carried out to see if circumcision would
      reduce the tragic epidemic that continues to rage in
      Africa.<sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup></p>

      <p>From time to time the popular press reports that one
      doctor or another recommends circumcision to reduce HIV
      infection. While it may be their personal opinion that
      circumcision prevents HIV transmission, since this has not
      yet been conclusively demonstrated, these opinions cannot be
      considered informed medical opinions. Frequently, the news
      item is based on a single study rather than the complete body
      of the medical literature. It would be foolish to base public
      health policy on such reports.</p>

      <p>The conditions in Africa are very different from those in
      the developed world. It would be wrong to apply findings from
      Africa to the developed nations.</p>

      <p>The Cochrane review of the medical literature "found
      insufficient evidence to support an interventional effect of
      male circumcision on HIV acquisition in heterosexual
      men."<sup><a href="#n68">68</a></sup></p>

      <p><img alt="" src="/gif/hline.png" /></p>

      <h2>Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT)</h2>

      <p>Despite the failure of observational studies to prove the
      alleged effect of male circumcision in preventing HIV
      infection, three randomized trials have recently been set up:
      One in South Africa (Orange Farm), one in Kenya, and one in
      Uganda. The first, conducted by Auvert, was published in
      2005.<sup><a href="#n77">77</a></sup> The other two have been
      terminated but have not been published, except for a press
      release.</p>

      <p>The Auvert study reported that young circumcised males in
      Orange Farm become infected more slowly than non-circumcised
      young males. This paper has received a large amount of
      attention in the worldwide media, but also was subject to <a
      href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=read-response&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020298"
       target="_blank">extensive scientific criticism</a>, which
      has been published at the PLoS website.</p>

      <p>The other two studies, which were terminated in the fall
      of 2006, have not been published. The possible influence of
      researcher bias on the interpretation of the findings remains
      to be seen.</p>

      <p>There is contradictory evidence. Some studies have found
      either no effect or more HIV in circumcised males.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup>
      <sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup> <sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup>
      <sup><a href="#n74">74</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n83">83</a></sup></p>

      <p>There remain serious medical ethical and human-rights
      issues around such studies. Non-therapeutic surgery on
      children or other incompetent individuals, who cannot give
      consent, falls under the definition of a <a
      href="/library/ethics/">human rights violation</a>, so any
      circumcision programs and studies should be limited to adults
      who can personally grant consent.</p>

      <p>Van Howe and Garenne have commented on the extensive
      promotion that has accompanied these allegedly scientific
      inquiries.<sup><a href="#n77">77</a></sup> <sup><a
      href="#n79">79</a></sup></p>

      <p>Ntozi predicted that the raging AIDS epidemic in Africa
      would generate extensive political pressure on governments to
      do something&mdash;anything&mdash;to fight the
      epidemic.<sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup> It is likely,
      therefore, that some African governments will institute
      programs of mass circumcision in Africa for political, not
      medical, reasons, although mass circumcision seems as likely
      to worsen the epidemic as improve it.<sup><a
      href="#n82">82</a></sup></p>

      <p>These studies assume that heterosexual transmission of HIV
      is the dominant disease vector. That may not be case.<sup><a
      href="#n63">63</a></sup> HIV infection in children points to
      health care as a source of HIV infection.<sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup> There are indications that
      homosexual activity in Africa is much higher than western
      researchers believe.<sup><a href="#n69">69</a></sup> Also,
      circumcision itself seems to transmit HIV infection.<sup><a
      href="#n83">83</a></sup></p>

      <p>These studies are limited to heterosexual female-to-male
      transmission in Africa. They are not applicable to developed
      nations. The CDC has never recommended circumcision for
      Americans.<sup><a href="#n81">81</a></sup></p>

      <p>de Witte <i>et al.</i> report that the Langerhans cells
      (found in the foreskin) produce Langerin, a substance that
      blocks the uptake of HIV.<sup><a href="#n87">87</a></sup></p>

      <p>Talbott reports that the percentage of females engaged in
      prostitution that determines the percentage of the population
      that is infected. When the RCTs are adjusted for the
      prostitute population, circumcision ceases to be effective at
      preventing HIV infection.<sup><a href="#n88">88</a></sup></p>

      <p>Talbott reports that the percentage of females engaged in
      prostitution that determines the percentage of the population
