      <h3 class="topic">Introduction</h3>
      <hr size="1" />

      <p>Recent publications have reported an association between
      the lack of male circumcision and sexual transmission of HIV
      [<a href="#n1">1-7</a>]. If confirmed, such an association
      may prompt interest in a possible intervention through male
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>It has been suggested that following circumcision, the
      surface epithelium of the glans develops a protective keratin
      layer, a form of natural condom [<a href="#n8">8</a>]. Thus,
      circumcision could reduce the HIV incidence by directly
      decreasing the susceptibility of uninfected men to HIV.
      Circumcision could also reduce the incidence of HIV by
      directly decreasing the infectivity of men with HIV, as
      suggested by the studies of tissue samples collected from
      macaques infected with the simian immunodeficiency virus
      (SIV), which showed infected mononuclear cells in the dermis
      and epidermis of the penile foreskin [<a
      href="#n9">9</a>].</p>

      <p>Furthermore, some or all sexually transmitted diseases
      (STD) may increase men's susceptibility to HIV [<a
      href="#n10">10,11</a>]. If circumcision reduces the
      transmission of genital infections, either by improving local
      hygiene [<a href="#n12">12</a>] or by accelerating the
      healing of otherwise subpreputial lesions [<a
      href="#n13">13-15</a>], circumcision may also delay HIV
      transmission. Therefore, potential associations between the
      lack of circumcision and STD other than HIV are also of
      interest.</p>

      <p>In the past, circumcision has been advocated for many
      reasons: for religious purposes among the Jews and Muslims;
      for cultural reasons among several African ethnic groups; for
      reasons of hygiene in the United States, Canada, and
      Australia and for therapeutic purposes&mdash;as the cure for
      phimosis. consequently, circumcision is almost universal in
      some parts of the world (United States and Muslim countries)
      and rare in others (Europe and South America). In all
      situations, cultural differences between circumcised and
      uncircumcised men may affect their sexual and hygienic
      behaviour, including their exposure to various STD and
      HIV.</p>

      <p>In this article we review the evidence in support of the
      association between the lack of circumcision and STD,
      including HIV infection, and the possible biological
      explanations. we discuss implications for public-health
      interventions and suggest areas and methods for further
      research.</p>

      <h3 class="topic">Epidemiological evidence</h3>
      <hr size="1" />

      <h4>Studies linking lack of circumcision to HIV
      infection</h4>

      <p>Twenty-three published study reports linking circumcision
      status to HIV infection were identified. The literature
      review included articles using circumcision as a key word,
      articles analysing risk factors for HIV infection and AIDS
      conference proceedings. Unfortunately, one-third of these
      studies were reported in abstracts with little detail. Four
      different study designs were used in these studies as
      described below.</p>

      <h4>Retrospective studies including partner studies</h4>

      <p>A number of reports of the association between HIV
      serostatus and the lack of circumcision were initially
      provided by retrospective studies. Most of these studies were
      not specifically designed to test a hypothesis about
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>Six partner studies [<a href="#n3">3, 16-20</a>] recruited
      heterosexual partners of HIV-infected patients to look for an
      association between the serostatus and circumcision status of
      the male partner. A significant association was observed in
      three of the studies [<a href="#n3">3,16,17</a>] <a
      href="/library/disease/HIV/vincenzi/#table1">(Table 1)</a>.
      However, the results were reported in abstracts with few
      methodological details.</p>

      <p>Differentiation between infectivity and susceptibility was
      possible in only one study [<a href="#n18">18</a>], which
      examined 109 female partners of HIV-infected men in Brazil.
      No association was observed between the lack of circumcision
      and male infectivity <a
      href="/library/disease/HIV/vincenzi/#table1">(Table
      1)</a></p>

      <p>Twelve retrospective studies [<a href="#n4">4-6,
      21-29</a>] recruited male populations to look for risk
      factors for HIV infection<a href=" #table2">(Table 2)</a>.
      Four [<a href="#n4">4,6,21,22</a>] reported significant
      associations between the lack of circumcision and an
      increased susceptibility to HIV infection in men <a
      href="/library/disease/HIV/vincenzi/#table2">(Table 2)</a>.
      Of these, only one was reported in a full paper [<a
      href="#n4">4</a>], which analysed data from 338 STD patients
      (11.2% infected with HIV) believed to have acquired their STD
      [genital ulcer disease (GUD) or urethritis] from a group of
      prostitutes known to have a high prevalence of STD. After
      adjustments for regular contacts with prostitutes and travels
      to neighbouring countries, uncircumcised men were at a higher
      risk of HIV infection only if they did <i>not</i> report a
      history of previous genital ulceration. Among those with a
      history of genital ulceration, no effect of circumcision on
      HIV status was observed.</p>

      <p>In another study where a marginal association was observed
      in univariate analysis [<a href="#n23">23</a>], only 20 men
      out of 610 were circumcised, which may have led to the test's
      poor ability to derive a statistical association (i.e. lack
      of statistical power) <a
      href="/library/disease/HIV/vincenzi/#table2">(Table 2)</a>.
      Similarly, Greenblatt <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#n24">24</a>]
      studied the risk of HIV infection among 115 men with GUD, an
      odds ratio (OR) of 3.3 was observed for uncircumcised men in
      univariate analysis <a
      href="/library/disease/HIV/vincenzi/#table2">(Table 2)</a>.
      After adjustment for age, number of partners, contacts with
      prostitutes, ethnic origin and birth place, the authors
      reported a loss of statistical significance without further
      details. However, it is not possible to know if this was due
      to an appropriate adjustment on true confounding factors or
      to a lack of statistical power because many variables were
      included in the model.</p>

      <p>Five out of the above six studies [<a
      href="#n4">4,6,22-24</a>] suggesting a protective role of
      circumcision were conducted in African countries and one in
      the United States [<a href="#n21">21</a>]. An additional six
      studies by three different teams working in Rwanda [<a
      href="#n25">25,26</a>], Uganda [<a href="#n27">27</a>] and
      the United States [<a href="#n28">28,29</a>] found no
      relationship between male circumcision and HIV status.</p>

      <h4>Cross-sectional serosurveys</h4>

      <p>The Muslim religion was used as a surrogate marker for
      male circumcision in two surveys performed in Uganda and
      C&oacute;&sup3;&pound;&nbsp;d'Ivoire [<a
      href="#n30">30,31</a>]. In the first survey 4.5% (6 out of
      133) of the Muslim men were HIV-infected compared with 9.2%
      (153 out of 1663) from other religious groups; while the
      difference was less important among women (10.6% versus
      12.6%). In the second survey `no relation between the
      HIV-seroprevalence rates of Moslems who practised
      circumcision and non-Moslems who are not circumcised were
      observed'. None of these studies obtained individual foreskin
      status, nor attempted to adjust for known risk factors for
      HIV.</p>

      <h4>Longitudinal study</h4>

      <p>Cameron <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#n5">5</a>] examined the
      risk for seroconversion in 370 HIV-seronegative men who
      reported recent contacts with prostitutes known to have high
      HIV infection rates. After a mean follow-up of 14 weeks for
      293 men, the authors estimated that uncircumcised men had 8.2
      times [confidence interval (CI), 3.0-23.0] the risk of
      acquiring HIV infection than circumcised men. There are
      several methodological limitations in this analysis.</p>

      <p>First, the proportion of circumcised men was higher among
      the 77 men lost to follow-up than among the 293 included in
      the analysis, and selection bias may have occurred in this
      study [<a href="#n32">32</a>]. Furthermore, 2 weeks of
      follow-up after the sexual exposure was considered an
      adequate follow-up. Since the median seroconversion time is
      usually assumed to be approximately 2 months, it is possible
      that a substantial proportion of seroconversions was missed.
      If the proportion of missed seroconversion was different
      among circumcised and uncircumcised men, further bias may
      have been introduced.</p>

      <p>Second, all documented seroconversions were attributed to
      an exposure to the same group of prostitutes, including those
      occurring more than 6 months after sexual contact with the
      prostitute. However, seroconversions are very rare (&lt;5%)
      after 6 months [<a href="#n33">33</a>]. At the 3-month
      follow-up, only those uncircumcised men who had a reported
      concomitant GUD were at increased risk of acquiring HIV. The
      interaction between circumcision status and reported presence
      or absence of genital ulcer disease was not taken into
      account in the multivariate analysis (estimating an adjusted
      OR when the OR in two different strata of a third variable
      are significantly different may be invalid).</p>

      <p>Third, only 25% of the men reported a single contact with
      a prostitute during the study, among whom only six
      seroconversions occurred. The statistical significance of the
      test (comparison of the seroconversion rates between
      circumcised and uncircumcised men) would disappear with the
      addition of a single seroconversion among circumcised
      men.</p>

      <p>These limitations, plus the fact that, to date, no other
      longitudinal study has replicated similar results, call for
      serious caution in the generalization of the results.</p>

      <h4>Ecological correlation</h4>

      <p>Two authors [<a href="#n1">1,2</a>] reported a correlation
      between estimated geographical frequencies in the lack of
      circumcision and estimated HIV prevalence in Africa. In
      discussing the limitations of such correlations, the authors
      emphasized that the high prevalence of HIV infection in a
      given area may be due to the early introduction of the virus
      into the area, and not necessarily to the relative rarity of
      male circumcision. Ecological correlations do not allow other
      factors, such as sexual behaviour, presence of other STD and
      other risks for HIV, to be taken into account. Moreover,
      indices of HIV prevalence are very crude, as well as data on
      circumcision which were based on anthropological studies
      written between 1930 and 1950.</p>

      <h4>Studies linking lack of circumcision to STD other than
      HIV infection</h4>

      <p>Only five studies [<a href="#n34">34-38</a>] were
      specifically designed to assess the association between
      selected STD and the lack of circumcision among men attending
      STD clinics <a
      href="/library/disease/HIV/vincenzi/#table3">(Table 3)</a>.
      Only one [<a href="#n35">35</a>] provided age-adjusted OR,
      while four reported crude measurements of risk. Three other
      authors reported results from studies not specifically
      designed to quantify the association between the lack of
      circumcision and men's susceptibility to sexually transmitted
      infections [<a href="#n21">21,39,40</a>]. Fortunately,
      available data on the circumcision status of men and
      infections/inflammatory penile lesions were analysed. As
      illustrated in <a
      href="/library/disease/HIV/vincenzi/#table3">Table 3</a>, the
      magnitude of the association between different STD and lack
      of circumcision, when present, is highly variable.</p>

      <p>GUD, mainly chancroid, were associated with the lack of
      circumcision in three studies of patients from an STD clinic
      on Nairobi, Kenya [<a href="#n4">4,5,41</a>]. In two studies
      data involving patients reporting for other STD as a control
      group allow the calculation of relative risks of 1.8
      [confidence interval (CI), 1.2-2.6] for past history of GUD
      [<a href="#n4">4</a>], and 1.6 (CI, 1.30-2.0) for present
      diagnosis of GUD [<a href="#n5">5</a>]. Other authors
      reported that they found less circumcised men among patients
      with GUD than expected, given the frequency of circumcision
      in the local population [<a href="#n42">42,43</a>].</p>

      <h3 class="topic">Interpreting the data: faith or
      evidence?</h3>
      <hr size="1" />

      <p>Several considerations apply for the interpretation of the
      current evidence relating STD and HIV to the lack of
      circumcision.</p>

      <h4>Susceptibility versus infectivity</h4>

      <p>Interpreting the evidence requires a distinction between
      susceptibility and infectivity. Only one partner study [<a
      href="#n18">18</a>] allowed the analysis of a potential
      association between the infectivity of HIV-infected men and
      the lack of circumcision <a
      href="/library/disease/HIV/vincenzi/#table1">(Table 1)</a>.
      In the other partner studies, the distinction between
      infective and susceptible men was not performed. If the lack
      of circumcision increased male susceptibility or infectivity
      but not both, mixing data on male-to-female and
      female-to-male transmission would lead to dilution bias
      because of the lack of specificity in the recorded cases of
      transmission (whatever the direction), whereas only cases of
      female-to-male transmission (for the study of male
      susceptibility) or only cases of male-to-female transmission
      (for the study of male infectivity) are of interest.</p>

      <p>Studies of STD other than HIV were performed on men only.
      In these studies, positive associations have always been
      related to an increased susceptibility to STD for
      uncircumcised men. However, for some STD such as herpes,
      infection might have occurred a long time before data
      collection. The study of men's susceptibility ideally
      requires the inclusion of new infections only.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, the portal of entry for pathogens and
      the type of clinical presentation vary according to the STD
      under study. The former may influence the mechanisms of
      sexual transmission and the potential role of circumcision.
      It is unclear what the portal of entry is for HIV, but for
      pathogens responsible for GUD and balanitis the portal of
      entry and the location of symptoms is the external epithelium
      of the penis (shaft, glans and foreskin). An attempt should
      be made to distinguish two different potential mechanisms of
      association between GUD and/or balanitis and the lack of
      circumcision: differential recovery from genital symptoms or
      differential susceptibility to infection.</p>

      <h4>Assessment of behaviours and adjustment for
      confounding</h4>

      <p>The main limitation to interpreting most results is the
      poor assessment of sexual behaviour and other potential
      confounders, such as hygienic practices between circumcised
      and uncircumcised men. Circumcision in Africa, where the
      majority of the studies on risk factors for HIV infection
      have been conducted, is highly related to religious and
      ethnic characteristics. It is possible that ethnic groups
      performing ritual circumcision have different sexual
      behaviours from those who do not, and therefore, different
      risks of being infected with HIV, due to factors other than
      circumcision status. An attempt to adjust for potential
      confounding factors related to sexual behaviour was made in
      only four studies searching for risk factors for HIV
      infection [<a href="#n4">4,5,17,24</a>]. In such
      circumstances, alternative explanations for observed
      associations between circumcision status and HIV infection
      can hardly be excluded.</p>

      <h4>Selection bias</h4>

      <p>The comparison groups (men without STD under study) should
      be exposed to STD agents in a similar manner as the group
      with STD to infer any causal association. This was attempted
      only in the Kenyan studies [<a href="#n4">4,5</a>], where
      cases and non-cases were exposed to the same group of
      prostitutes with high HIV infection rate.</p>

      <p>Most of the studies, conducted among STD clinic attenders,
      assumed that circumcised and uncircumcised men used these
      health facilities in the same way, but socioeconomic and
      cultural factors may differ between the two groups. It is
      possible that circumcised men seek care in circumstances
      different from uncircumcised men; for example, in cases of
      severe genital symptoms such as GUD, for any minor symptom,
      or for an `at risk' sexual contact even without symptoms. Of
      circumcised men are overrepresented among patients with minor
      symptoms (who often serve as controls), the association
      between the lack of circumcision and STD would be
      overestimated if not spuriously generated.</p>

      <h4>Misclassification of exposure</h4>

      <p>In many studies, men's circumcision status was assessed by
      physical examination. In a few studies, assessment of
      circumcision status was not specified or relied on
      self-report. Only two authors studied the reliability of
      self-reports. Among 1304 Australian men [<a
      href="#n35">35</a>], 98.% gave an accurate report of their
      circumcision status, whereas in the United States [<a
      href="#n28">28</a>], 17.7% of uncircumcised men and 8.4% of
      circumcised men misclassified themselves. The potential
      effects of differential and non-differential
      misclassification on epidemiological associations have been
      illustrated elsewhere [<a href="#n44">44</a>].</p>

      <h4>Measure of association</h4>

      <p>OR and their CI were usually reported to measure the
      association between the lack of circumcision and HIV
      infection. However, relative risks (RR) always provide lower
      estimates of association. From one Kenyan cross-sectional
      study [<a href="#n6">6</a>] the adjusted OR is equal to 5.2
      (CI, 1.6-18.8) but the RR is 3.5 (CI, 2.6-4.8). Since the
      magnitude of the measure of association enforces the
      presumption for causality, the use of OR, when it
      overestimates the RR, may be misleading toward causality.</p>

      <h4>Publication bias</h4>

      <p>Researchers whose studies show `no effect' either do not
      submit their results, or find it difficult to get published
      [<a href="#n45">45</a>]. Such a bias is not confined to an
      examination of circumcision and HIV status, but cannot be
      excluded since the present article relies on published
      reports.</p>

      <p>In summary, lack of distinction between susceptibility and
      infectivity, inadequate control for confounding variables,
      potential selection bias and misclassification of exposure,
      inappropriate choice of a comparison group, and publication
      bias may lead to under- or overestimation of the association.
      It is difficult to predict the net effect of these sources of
      bias. Furthermore, the magnitude of the association, when
      present, varies strongly between studies and its crude
      measure is overestimated in some reports by the use of OR
      instead of RR. The results of observational studies conducted
      to date, therefore, require cautions interpretation, and one
      has to find the middle ground between faith and evidence.</p>

      <h3 class="topic">Implications for public-health
      interventions</h3>
      <hr size="1" />

      <p>Assuming that there is an association between circumcision
      and HIV transmission, the magnitude of the benefit should be
      balanced with the expected medical complications, the
      acceptability and the cost of the medical intervention before
      any public-health decision can be reached. A wide range of
      decisions are possible ranging from maintaining the practice
      wherever it already exists to advocating wide-spread mass
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>Male circumcision is not without medical side-effects;
      with regard to newborn circumcision, septic complications may
      occur in poor hygienic settings, although to our knowledge no
      systematic data has been collected. Complications are likely
      to be even more problematic in adolescent and adult
      circumcision, possibly causing pain, haemorrhage, and healing
      problems. Thus, adult and, in some settings, newborn
      circumcision may generate more harm than benefit. The onus is
      therefore to produce adequate evidence of safety before a
      supposedly protective intervention is implemented [<a
      href="#n46">46</a>].</p>

      <p>For the reasons discussed above, the quantification of a
      potential benefit, if any, that could be expected from male
      circumcision vis &iuml;&iquest;&frac12;is HIV transmission,
      is highly problematic. The lack of consistency between
      results, the limitations of studies reported to date, the
      critical time lag between large-scale implementation of
      circumcision and any measurable effect, and more decisively,
      the lack of a coherent model for the facilitation of HIV
      transmission in uncircumcised men make attempts to calculate
      attributable risks in different populations rather
      inaccurate.</p>

      <p>Besides potential benefits to be obtained and the safety
      of a public-health intervention, it is important not only to
      examine its acceptability and feasibility, but also to
      compare these characteristics with those of alternative
      interventions. The acceptability of a new surgical
      intervention on the male reproductive tract is likely to be
      problematic in settings where the religious and sociocultural
      context usually outweighs public-health considerations.
      Behavioural changes, at least as important as those required
      for the adoption of condoms, and a general shift in social
      norms will clearly be required to introduce male circumcision
      as a new general practice. Furthermore, operational
      requirements needed to introduce neonatal, adolescent or
      adult circumcision are likely to be considerable. In many
      cases, such undertaking will require mass communication
      programmes for public education, training of overburdened
      health-care personnel, and supplies necessary for the
      surgical procedure.</p>

      <p>Given limited public-health resources, the ratio of
      benefits and costs and the range of culturally acceptable
      alternative interventions, such as condom promotion for the
      control of HIV and STD, have to be considered in each
      setting.</p>
      <br />
       

      <h3 class="topic">Proposal for future research</h3>
      <hr size="1" />

      <p>In addition to differentiating susceptibility from
      infectivity, and assessing a potential indirect mechanism
      through which lack of circumcision could enhance HIV
      transmission via increased rates or duration of STD, it is
      necessary to consider potential confounding factors. Clearly,
      an association between circumcision status and HIV infection
      may result, in whole or in part, from their mutual dependence
      on patterns of sexual activity or, for instance, on hygienic
      behaviours. To our knowledge no systematic data have been
      collected on the latter in order to establish possible
      differences between circumcised and uncircumcised men.
      However, anecdotal evidence suggest that such differences may
      exist in some cultural contexts, as indicated in a recent
      study of urban men in Rwanda [<a href="#n47">47</a>].</p>
      <img align="right" src="vincenzi-fig1.gif" alt="Figure 1"
      hspace="20" /> 

      <p><span><b>Fig. 1.</b> Schematic representation of different
      mechanisms through which the lack of circumcision could
      operate for the facilitation of HIV transmission, STD,
      sexually transmitted diseases.</span></p>

      <p>Figure 1 illustrates some of the possible mechanisms
      through which the lack of circumcision could operate for the
      facilitation of HIV transmission. Based on our present
      knowledge, research priorities might focus on a better
      understanding of the biological mechanisms through which the
      lack of circumcision could enhance STD and HIV transmission.
      Animal and primate research could assist in this endeavour.
      Studies of the association between circumcision status and
      sexual and hygienic behaviours in different populations,
      using both quantitative and qualitative methods, should
      highlight the strength of potential confounding effects.</p>

      <p>Among the sexually acquired diseases that need further
      study of their potential association with circumcision,
      priority should be given to GUD for several rasons. First,
      previous studies provide more arguments for an association
      between the lack of circumcision and GUD than between the
      lack of circumcision and urethritis. Second, a potential
      association between the lack of circumcision and duration of
      genital symptoms might be stronger for GUD than for
      urethritis. Third, one of the mechanisms through which a
      potential association between the lack of circumcision and
      HIV infection could operate is a suspected association
      between GUD and HIV infection. The assessment of an indirect
      effect requires the assessment of the two underlying direct
      effects (lack of circumcision --&gt; GUD, and GUD --&gt;
      HIV). Simultaneously obtaining both assessments within the
      same study would probably be difficult. Fourth, GUD are more
      common than HIV infection in some parts of the world.
      recruitment of cases may therefore be easier to determine for
      GUD than for HIV infection.</p>

      <p>Most of the published reports of epidemiological studies
      rely on data retrospectively recorded from STD clinic
      attenders. Seeking medical care may be related to
      sociocultural variables and severity of symptoms, both of
      which may be related to circumcision. In particular, the
      sociocultural and behavioural background of men without STD
      in these settings might be different from those with a STD.
      Other male population groups, such as employees in a factory,
      would be interesting to study. As STD prevalence in these
      populations may be low, large study samples may be needed to
      allow the identification of risk factors for STD
      acquisition.</p>

      <p>Case-control studies allow a more careful choice of
      controls than cross-sectional studies. Controls should be
      chosen as individuals without STD but who are exposed to STD
      as are the cases. Cases and controls should have similar
      sexual behaviours during the investigated period, including
      the number and type of partners, condom use and frequency of
      sexual contacts. The recruitment of male partners of women
      diagnosed with the STD under study may help to control that
      men with and without the STD were exposed to the
      pathogen.</p>

      <p>Longitudinal studies imply the prospective followup of
      circumcised and uncircumcised men who were equally exposed to
      STD/HIV, and a complete recording of each STD/HIV occurrence.
      Results of such studies are reliable only if the follow-up is
      achievable for almost all individuals included.</p>

      <p>Intervention studies would imply mass circumcision in
      well-defined male populations, and the evaluation of the
      potential benefits for these populations (and their partners)
      in terms of avoided infections. Following newborn
      circumcision, the important time-lag between implementation
      and its measurable impact (if any) will complicate the
      conduct of such studies. If a causal link exists, adolescent
      and adult circumcisions may delay the spread of HIV infection
      more immediately than newborn circumcision. However, for the
      reasons discussed above, it is suggested that such studies be
      discouraged.</p>
      <br />
       

      <h3 class="topic">Conclusion</h3>
      <hr size="1" />

      <p>The potential public-health benefits of male circumcision
      have been greatly discussed in the past 50 years, often in a
      passionate and emotional manner. However, relatively few
      studies have been carried out and those that have, present
      conflicting results. The major criticism of most of the
      studies preformed to date is the lack of attention given to
      potential confounding factors, which could be related to both
      circumcision status and risk of sexually transmitted
      infections, such as sexual behaviour or differences in
      hygienic practices, or differential use of specific health
      facilities. As Poland [<a href="#n48">48</a>] noted, "We must
      remember that circumcision is not performed randomly."</p>

      <p>Therefore, further efforts are still required to quantify
      the relative risk associated with the lack of male
      circumcision. Some of this can be achieved by using
      observational designs which better address the limitations
      discussed above. Laboratory and primate research might also
      continue to provide useful information.</p>

      <p>As the safety, expected benefits, feasibility and
      acceptability of mass circumcision are all questionable,
      neither public-health interventions nor intervention studies
      appear to be defensible options before there is stronger
      evidence from observational studies in different settings
      that show lack of male circumcision may be a genuinely
      independent risk factor for the transmission of HIV.</p>
