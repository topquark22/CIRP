      <p class="summary"><span class="sum"><b>Summary:</b></span>
      Public health authorities have long believed that the
      preponderance of AIDS cases in Africa are attributable to
      &lsquo;heterosexual transmission&rsquo;; most people silently
      assume this rubric to indicate penile&ndash;vaginal
      intercourse only. Recent epidemiologic analyses suggest that
      the majority of HIV cases in sub-Saharan Africa may be due to
      non-sterile health care practices. The present paper reviews
      the anthropological, proctologic, and infectious disease
      literature, and argues that both homosexuality and
      heterosexual anal intercourse are more prevalent in Africa
      than has traditionally been believed. The authors hypothesize
      that perhaps the majority of HIV transmission not accounted
      for by iatrogenic exposure could be accounted for by
      unsuspected and unreported penile&ndash;anal intercourse.
      Given the authors&rsquo; findings, properly conducted studies
      to measure this HIV transmission vector, while controlling
      for iatrogenic exposure confound, are clearly warranted in
      Africa and in countries with similar epidemiologic
      characteristics.</p>

      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p class="text1">Public health authorities have long believed
      that almost all cases of AIDS in African adults are
      attributable to &lsquo;heterosexual transmission&rsquo; a
      rubric tacitly understood to refer to penile&ndash;vaginal
      intercourse. This default assumption is reinforced by
      time-honoured denial of penile&ndash;anal practices in
      Africa. Recent reassessment of epidemiologic evidence
      indicates that a substantial amount, if not the
      preponderance, of HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa is
      of iatrogenic origin<sup><a href="#n1">1,2</a></sup>. In this
      communication, we review evidence from several sources to
      support our contention that the majority of HIV transmission
      not accounted for by iatrogenic exposure could be accounted
      for by unsuspected and unreported homosexual and heterosexual
      penile&ndash;anal practices. We conclude that properly
      conducted studies to measure the contribution to HIV
      transmission of this underrecognized sexual vector are
      clearly warranted in Africa and in countries with similar
      epidemiologic characteristics.</p>

      <p class="text2">In this analysis, we review published
      evidence about anal intercourse in sub-Saharan Africa, using
      sources from the anthropological, physiological, and
      epidemiological literature. Our aim is to emphasize its
      presence and importance and to encourage its assessment in
      infectious disease studies.</p>

      <h4>Anthropological reports</h4>

      <p class="text1">Recently published anthropological reports
      document the long and diverse history of homosexuality in
      multifarious African cultures<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>.
      The authors opine that European views of Africans as
      primitive, and hence &lsquo;natural&rsquo; people fostered
      the empirically unfounded view of exclusively heterosexual
      practices in Africa. In the mid-19th century, anecdotal
      reports of anal intercourse in Africa blamed foreign
      (especially European and Arabic) influences, or domestic
      import, especially by neighbouring tribes. The authors, who
      also provide an appendix with terms for same-sex partners in
      many indigenous languages, note that anthropologists, when
      confronted with the reality of homosexuality in Africa,
      deliberately avoided reporting it for fear of undermining
      European preconceptions. Anthropologists were aware, for
      example, of homosexual marriages which entailed
      &lsquo;brideprice&rsquo; paid to the boy-bride&rsquo;s
      parents, but remained silent about such unorthodox practices.
      Distilling information from numerous anthropological reports,
      including early 17th century observations of homosexuality in
      Africa by the Portuguese and reports of homosexual marriages
      among Angolans (noting that &lsquo;sodomy was rampant among
      the people of Angola&rsquo;, Ref. 3, p 147), the authors
      conclude that it was not homosexuality which was imported to
      Africa by Europeans but, rather, its intolerance. Not only
      did this fail to discourage such behaviours but, more
      importantly, encouraged secrecy and denial by Africans.
      Despite the 1865 conjecture by David Livingstone that the
      monopolization of women by tribal leaders led sexually
      dispossessed men to homosexual behaviour in what is now
      Zimbabwe, the accounts of contemporary homosexual behaviour
      across sub-Saharan Africa indicate a striking proportion of
      bisexual behaviour by males. For example: in 1925 Angola,
      Falk estimated that 90% of the male population was
      behaviourally bisexual and 3.5% exclusively homosexual<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup>. It is noted by the authors that in
      many African cultures, it is marriage and reproduction that
      are universally required, not heterosexual attraction.</p>

      <p class="text2">Homosexuality in Africa is a virtually taboo
      subject. Secrecy and misreporting characterize its treatment
      by observers<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>. Teunis, for
      example, found his study subjects in Dakar &lsquo;by
      employing that gaze that gay men recognize from one another
      across many different countries&rsquo; (p 175), and reported
      that there is much bisexuality among married men, as well as
      a smaller group of men with feminine mannerisms who
      apparently practise largely or exclusively receptive anal
      intercourse. He reported homosexual cultures in different
      parts of Africa, as did others<sup><a
      href="#n3">3,6</a></sup>. Specific instances include reports
      of homosexual sex between Kenyan truck drivers and teenage
      boys<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>, and anal intercourse in
      Zimbabwe<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>. Epprecht<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> discussed the history of male
      homosexuality in Lesotho, examining early and mid 20th
      century homosexual events, including same-sex marriage
      ceremonies. Halperin<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> noted
      the informal &lsquo;male wife&rsquo; practice in South
      African migrant mining camps. Earlier, Fumento<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> noted that the American homosexual
      press reported on the ease with which visitors can find
      homosexuals in Africa (many of whom are bisexual).</p>

      <p class="text2">Although it should not be news that prison
      life frequently entails violence and homosexuality, there
      have been recent news reports of South African prison gangs
      using anal rape by HIV seropositives to punish
      disobedience<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>; of course, the
      insertive partner must be sufficiently aroused sexually to
      mete out the punishment.</p>

      <p class="text2">Anecdotal internet anthropology may be
      gleaned from an all-African homosexual website<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> that provides myriad news and
      personal tales of homosexuality in Africa, including &lsquo;a
      whole village of gay men dressed as women&rsquo; in Somalia;
      &lsquo;Botswana women said the problems of guys going gay is
      a matter of concern with others alleging that they have lost
      their boyfriends who instead opted for gayism&rsquo; (sic);
      &lsquo;The gay person is looked at primarily as a
      &lsquo;&lsquo;gatekeeper&rsquo;&rsquo;. . . the link between
      this world and the other world&rsquo; in Burkina Faso; a
      medical researcher in Kenya is quoted as saying: &lsquo;Men
      having sex with men is not only common among young people,
      but fashionable&rsquo;; and many more. In most cases, the
      male tales refer to behavioural bisexuality.</p>

      <p class="text2">Perhaps the most important anthropological
      report of homosexual behaviour in Africa is
      Lockhart&rsquo;s<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup>, who studied
      street boys in Mwanza, Tanzania (a city with a 11.8% adult
      HIV prevalence). Such a study should raise researchers&rsquo;
      index of suspicion for seeking self-reports of, especially,
      receptive anal intercourse, irrespective of sex. The boys in
      Mwanza, aged eight to 20, report having anal intercourse with
      other street boys, as part of initiation rites (i.e., forced
      receptive anal intercourse, by a gang of boys) into street
      boy culture and, following acceptance into the street life,
      occasionally awakening from sleep to find themselves being
      anally penetrated. Prostitution was rare; anal intercourse
      was placed in context of belonging to the group, as well as
      an exercise of power. Anal intercourse with older men known
      or not known to the street boys was also reported and often
      attributed to prison rape. By age 18, all boys also reported
      heterosexual sex; unfortunately, no information regarding
      heterosexual anal intercourse is provided. None of the boys
      considered their same-sex intercourse to be a homosexual
      act<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup>.</p>

      <h4>Evidence from pathology: gay bowel syndrome and other
      conditions</h4>

      <p class="text1">Nearly half a decade before identification
      of what would be known as AIDS, Sohn and Robilotti<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> published their classic paper
      &lsquo;The gay bowel syndrome&rsquo;, in which they catalogue
      the symptomatology of male receptive anal intercourse.
      Symptoms included both infectious (e.g. anal condyloma,
      <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i>-positive stools, rectal
      gonorrhoea, and hepatitis-A markers) and non-infectious
      pathologies (e.g., anal fistulas/ fissures, haemorrhoids).
      The authors note &lsquo;there are certain physical findings
      which, while not absolutely diagnostic, should alert the
      examiner to the possibility of homosexuality&rsquo; and refer
      to anal warts as well as other signs, such as diminished anal
      sphincter tone. The authors also note that many of the
      homosexual patients reported sex with women or were even
      married, but also that 10% of patients with anal condylomata
      denied proctogenital sex. Although both hepatitis and
      dysentery infections are common in Africa, they are
      attributed to contaminated water or food and to substandard
      hygienic practices often noted in developing countries. These
      infections are almost never assumed to derive from
      oral&ndash;anal sexual contact. Because careful scrutiny of
      the available African literature suggests signs of &lsquo;gay
      bowel syndrome&rsquo; even in heterosexual women ostensibly
      frequently engaging in receptive anal intercourse (see
      below), researchers&rsquo; index of suspicion for evidence of
      such practice should be raised. Apparently, first mention in
      the medical literature was the late 19th century observation
      by Haberlandt<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> of male
      homosexual prostitutes of Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania):
      &lsquo;Most of them get rectal problems, which they seek to
      hide in the beginning through kerchief pluggings and
      applications of perfume&rsquo; (p 64). More recent reports
      include the description, in a cohort of 300 patients admitted
      to a hospital in Nigeria<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup>, of
      anal fistulas, anal fissures, and haemorrhoids (this despite
      a presumably colon-friendly African diet compared with that
      of New York City homosexual men). Notably, the male-to-female
      ratio was 4.5:1 for haemorrhoids; 6.5:1 for anal fistulas;
      and 2:1 for anal fissures. The authors were unable to explain
      the lopsided sex ratio. It was, in addition, noted that
      because of the near ubiquity of stool parasites, any
      association of parasites with haemorrhoids was incidental. A
      later survey of the general population in Nigeria<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> found a 2.4% prevalence of anal
      fistulas (all in men), 23.8% prevalence of anal fissures
      (equally distributed by sex), and a 13.7% prevalence of
      haemorrhoids. Another report on a series of patients in
      Nigeria with fistulas<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> noted
      the presence in several cases of lax anal sphincteric tone.
      Fistulas have also been attributed to anal sexual abuse of
      children in Nigeria<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">In theory, the anal pathologies recorded in
      medical reports could be attributed to infectious disease, or
      to trauma, not related to anal intercourse. However, the
      finding that 11% of anal squamous cell carcinomas from a
      South African sample contained human papillomavirus (HPV)
      type 16 DNA<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> points to the
      presence of anal intercourse. Although the 11% prevalence,
      unspecified as to sex of the donors, was lower than
      prevalence from samples obtained in Switzerland, the United
      Kingdom, and Poland, the level was consistent with prevalence
      of HPV type 16 in South African cervical cancer biopsies.
      Other African studies have also reported case studies of
      rectal, anal, or perianal condyloma<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup> or their complications<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">In a 1981 sample of pregnant black women in
      South Africa, gonorrhoea infection was established by
      standard culture and confirmatory testing in 11.7% of the
      1200 women<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup>. Of the 140
      infected women, rectal cultures were positive in 41.6%. Thus
      4.8% of the sample was diagnosed with rectal gonorrhoea.
      Predictably, given belief about strict heterosexuality in
      Africa, the authors report their belief that anal intercourse
      is rare in their patient population. Such an attitude, if
      pervasive among clinicians in Africa, may explain the dearth
      of sexually transmitted infections studies in Africa that
      include rectal culture or examination.</p>

      <h4>Epidemiological reports</h4>

      <p class="text1">Studies of self-reported behaviours
      perceived as pejorative or as socially undesirable
      undoubtedly contain misreports<sup><a
      href="#n25">25&ndash;27</a></sup>. There is ample evidence of
      such under-reporting, particularly of homosexual or anal
      intercourse behaviours, in North American and European
      surveys. Given our understanding of social mores in
      sub-Saharan Africa and given criminal codes against such
      practices in most of these countries, one expects such
      behaviours to be less likely to be reported than in North
      America or Europe; thus blanket denials of anal intercourse
      in surveys from Africa probably reflect cultural reluctance,
      as well as (foreign?) researchers&rsquo; low index of
      suspicion and, perhaps, personal reluctance. As for
      reluctance among Africans, Falk<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup>, referring to male homosexual
      behaviour of the Wawihe tribe of Angola, observed in 1923:
      &lsquo;. . . while the act is permitted, speaking about it is
      considered disgusting&rsquo; (p 168).</p>

      <p class="text2">Studies in both North America and Europe
      have shown that use of specific technologies usually result
      in either the detection of misreport<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup> or increased likelihood that
      subjects admit to experience with receptive anal intercourse;
      for example, one study reports that women were 800% more
      likely to admit having experienced anal intercourse to a
      computer questionnaire than to a human interviewer<sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup>. Unfortunately these approaches have
      not been widely used in Africa. However, when South African
      prostitute diary recordings of sexual behaviour were compared
      with their recalled behaviour frequencies (the latter is more
      commonly used when studying sexual behaviour in Africa), the
      diaries led to a frequency of anal intercourse 387% (with
      partners) to 400% (with clients) higher than the estimate
      produced by recall estimates. Although other sexual acts were
      also underreported with the recall estimate, for clients anal
      intercourse was the most underestimated<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">Immunological abnormalities were reported in
      eight of 10 South African &lsquo;self-confessed
      homosexuals&rsquo; examined in 1983 (p 119)<sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup>. In a 1985 report on &lsquo;slim
      disease&rsquo; in Uganda, it was noted that the first
      reported positive human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III
      cases occurred in Tanzanian traders, who reported having both
      heterosexual and homosexual activity (without any query
      regarding the details of those activities)<sup><a
      href="#n32">32</a></sup>. More recently, 42% of a sample of
      South African truck drivers admitted to engaging in
      heterosexual anal sex<sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup>.
      Fourteen percent of prostitutes studied in a Kenyan sample
      admitted to anal intercourse (in addition, 3% admitted to
      injecting drug use)<sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup>. Nearly
      half (42.8%) of prostitutes in a South African sample
      admitted engaging in anal sex; their HIV prevalence was
      61.3%, compared with 42.7% in prostitutes who denied anal
      sex<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup>. Nine percent of male and
      female students in a Tanzanian study reported that anal
      intercourse was their first sexual act<sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup>, while 18% of males (and 44% of
      females) in a Senegalese survey reported homosexual
      experience<sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup>. Twelve percent of
      female college students in a Togo study reportedly had
      experienced anal intercourse<sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup>.
      In Zimbabwe, 35% of a large representative sample<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> of persons aged 18&ndash;27 reported
      having engaged in anal intercourse in the preceding two
      months.</p>

      <p class="text2">In a multicentre study in sub-Saharan
      Africa, female prostitutes were asked about anal intercourse
      with their most recent client, and allowed to respond in both
      a direct (yes/no) and in a vague manner (&lsquo;women
      reporting several types of intercourse without specifying
      what they were&rsquo;, p S64). Few of the women (0 to 4%)
      responded directly. Allowed to answer indirectly, 2&ndash;11%
      answered affirmatively, with higher rates in cities with
      higher HIV prevalences<sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup>.
      Regrettably, these prostitutes were not queried about longer
      time frames than last client.</p>

      <p class="text2">In a multicentre study evaluating the
      effects of a spermicidal cream on HIV transmission in African
      prostitutes, the baseline self-reported anal intercourse
      rates were associated with seroconversion risk on a location
      basis (the authors did not provide correlations for
      individual anal intercourse risk of seroconversion, or even
      discuss the issue of anal intercourse rates being associated
      with seroconversion risk<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup>). In
      Durban, South Africa, the baseline anal intercourse rate was
      41% (the HIV seroconversion rate at that location was
      16&ndash;26 per 100 womanyears; the range reflects rates in
      the two spermicidal conditions), in Cotonou, Benin, the
      baseline anal intercourse rate was 8% and seroconversion rate
      8&ndash;11%, and in Abidjan, C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire (Ivory
      Coast), the baseline anal intercourse rate was
      &lsquo;55%&rsquo;, and seroconversion rate 0&ndash;7%. The
      admitted anal intercourse rate had climbed to 75% at the time
      of follow-up in the South African sample, but no such data
      were provided for the other sites.</p>

      <p class="text2">In a Zambian prison<sup><a
      href="#n41">41</a></sup>, 8.4% of inmates admitted to having
      experienced homosexual anal intercourse, &lsquo;although
      indirect questioning suggested a much higher figure&rsquo; (p
      1388), and all such men reported active heterosexual
      relationships outside of prison (none used condoms for
      homosexual anal intercourse). Finally, in a Nigerian prison,
      53% of the men reported sex with men while imprisoned<sup><a
      href="#n42">42</a></sup>. The street boys of Tanzania
      reported a near universality (98.7%) of receptive anal
      intercourse<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup>, consistent with
      earlier studies cited by the investigator.</p>

      <h4>Discussion</h4>

      <p class="text1">Our inquiry into the available, admittedly
      sparse, published literature suggests that anal intercourse
      is much more common in the populations living in sub-Saharan
      Africa than customarily suspected or reported by clinicians
      and researchers. Africans, like people from the rest of the
      world, apparently have significant experience with homosexual
      and heterosexual anal intercourse. Indeed, as noted above, in
      some African samples, prevalence might actually be higher
      than typically reported elsewhere in the world. What is
      noteworthy about male homosexuality in Africa is its most
      common form of expression: bisexuality. If such men have anal
      intercourse with women, or if the integrity of
      cervico-vaginal epithelium in their female partners is
      compromised by genital ulcer diseases, especially syphilis,
      the efficient sexual transmission of HIV is undoubtedly
      facilitated.</p>

      <p class="text2">We found no evidence for some practices
      reported from North America and Europe, such as
      &lsquo;fisting&rsquo; or similar parasexual procedures that
      enhance HIV transmission<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup>.
      However, tribal enemas are part of traditional medicine in
      southern Africa; in some tribes such enemas are administered
      as often as 50 to 100 times annually and may contain toxic
      substances which can inflict colon damage<sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup>, possibly enhancing HIV
      transmission.</p>

      <p class="text2">With the possible exceptions of cities like
      Johannesburg and Cape Town in South Africa, the presence of
      gay venues offering multipartnered sex that were important
      for rapid HIV transmission in New York City and in San
      Francisco are apparently absent in sub-Saharan Africa.
      Consequently, there are probably few African men who have
      experienced the accumulation of hundreds of partners
      frequently reported in North American and European studies,
      particularly in the early days of the AIDS epidemic<sup><a
      href="#n11">11,27</a></sup>. This putative difference may
      limit the magnitude of &lsquo;sexual&rsquo; HIV transmission
      in Africa. Good studies need to be conducted, particularly in
      light of reports such as Falk&rsquo;s in the 1920s: a
      physician caring for miners told Falk that one of his male
      patients presented &lsquo;with a totally ripped, bleeding
      anus&rsquo; (p 189) after a night of prostitution with 45
      clients<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">Given recent reassessment of AIDS
      epidemiology in parts of Africa, behaviours most relevant to
      its transmission there (and probably in much of the Third
      World) seem less likely to be sexual than a consequence of
      unhygienic practices and medical care. Intriguingly, the
      virtual gender parity in the distribution of AIDS cases in
      Africa is consistent not only with suspected health care
      transmission<sup><a href="#n2">2</a>,<a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup>, but with presumably widespread male
      bisexuality<sup><a href="#n45">45</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">The purpose of this presentation is to
      present evidence that, despite consistent denials to the
      contrary, homosexuality and heterosexual anal intercourse may
      be common in sub-Saharan Africa, and that African AIDS cases
      not attributable to health care exposures may well be due
      primarily to anal intercourse. We suspect that modern day
      denial of heterosexual anal intercourse is exacerbated by the
      exigencies of AIDS propaganda and politics (&lsquo;It&rsquo;s
      everybody&rsquo;s disease&rsquo;).</p>

      <p class="text2">That persons of reproductive age with
      healthy genitals are not likely to acquire HIV from
      unprotected penile&ndash;vaginal intercourse<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup> is substantially supported by
      Greenhead and colleagues<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup>;
      they show that, in punch biopsies of vaginal and cervical
      tissue inundated with HIV for six to 24 hours, HIV was unable
      to penetrate or infect healthy vaginal or cervical tissue.
      Notably, intestinal tissue subjected to similar treatment was
      readily infected, an observation which is consistent with
      known ease of HIV transmission via anal intercourse. Of
      course, women who are manifestly unhealthy, such as those
      with syphilitic chancres compromising the integrity of the
      vagina, run a significant risk from vaginal
      intercourse<sup><a href="#n47">47,48</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">In one respect, the epidemiology of AIDS in
      Africa might be similar to that in the First World:
      injections and anal intercourse appear to be the primary
      conduits for HIV transmission<sup><a
      href="#n25">25&ndash;27</a>,<a href="#n49">49</a></sup>, a
      major difference being that parenteral transmission in the
      First World stems from conscious sharing of needles for
      injecting illicit drugs, whereas in Africa and, likely, other
      Third World venues, much transmission seemingly results from
      iatrogenic exposure with its inadvertent sharing of medical
      sharps.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is noteworthy that the street boys of
      Tanzania, nearly all of whom reported receptive anal
      intercourse, reported that AIDS could be transmitted by
      sexual intercourse, but all denied its transmission via their
      own receptive anal intercourse, because that practice did not
      involve a woman<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup>. Failure of
      public health messages to differentially warn about the known
      dangers of anal, as opposed to vaginal, intercourse has a
      seemingly political rather than scientific origin. Political
      correctness and its ally, gullibility, has led to acceptance
      of the socially desirable but undocumented claim by some
      clinicians and researchers that neither homosexuality nor
      heterosexual anal intercourse occurs frequently in
      sub-Saharan Africa. The time has come to conduct proper
      scientific studies to assess the true magnitude not only of
      iatrogenic HIV transmission, but of its specific sexual
      routes.</p>
