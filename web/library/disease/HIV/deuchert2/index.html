      <h2>Plausible and Implausible Parameters for Mathematical
      Modeling of Nominal Heterosexual HIV Transmission</h2>

      <p>E-mail: <a

      <p><sup>a</sup>From the Department of International Economic
      Policy, <a href="http://www.uni-freiburg.de/index_en.php"
      target="_blank">University of Freiburg</a>, Germany (E.D.),
      and School of Social Sciences, <a

      of Paisley</a>, United Kingdom (S.B.)</p>

      <h4>Purpose</h4>

      <p>Several mathematical models simulate a HIV/AIDS epidemic
      by using the assumption that heterosexual transmission is the
      major or sole transmission mode. The validity of these models
      has been unclear. To understand the validity of these models,
      empirical estimates for relevant model parameters are needed
      that can be compared with parameters used in mathematical
      models.</p>

      <h4>Methods</h4>

      <p>A brief review of per-contact transmission probabilities
      based on HIV-discordant, monogamous couples is provided, and
      sources of bias in transmission efficiency estimates are
      discussed. Average number of partnerships and the
      distribution of partnerships are estimated for seven
      sub-Saharan African countries. Distribution parameters are
      fitted to the Poisson distribution, negative binomial
      distribution, and the discrete Pareto (Zipf) distribution,
      using the maximum likelihood method. The Pearson
      &chi;<sup>2</sup> test statistic is used to measure goodness
      of fit, and the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria are
      also provided. To balance the reported number of
      partnerships, missing number of prostitutes is estimated.
      These empirical estimates for relevant model parameters are
      compared with parameters used in representative models of
      nominal heterosexual HIV transmission in Africa.</p>

      <h4>Results</h4>

      <p>Reported transmission efficiencies (unadjusted for
      competing exposures that inflate estimates) per sexual
      episode range from 0.0003 to 0.0012. Average number of
      partnerships is less than 1.5 in all countries. The discrete
      Pareto distribution fits the data better than the Poisson or
      negative binominal distribution. In almost all countries,
      female reported number of partners follows a discrete Pareto
      distribution. To close the sex disparity gap in number of
      partnerships, between 0.13% and 0.69% of the female
      population would need to be classified as prostitutes.
      Comparing these estimates with the parameter values used in
      existing mathematical models shows that existing models use
      grossly inflated per contact transmission efficiencies or
      rely on implausible assumptions regarding contact frequency,
      which results in implausibly high per-partner transmission
      rates. Assumptions regarding average number of partners are
      too high, and the distribution of partnerships is not
      supported by available data. <span class="yellow">As a
      consequence, existing mathematical models overestimate
      nominally heterosexually transmitted HIV infection in
      sub-Saharan Africa.</span></p>

      <h4>Conclusions</h4>

      <p>Existing models of nominal heterosexual HIV transmission
      for sub-Saharan Africa rely on assumptions inconsistent with
      empirical evidence. Simulations have not accurately portrayed
      the epidemiological situation in sub-Saharan Africa, and
      conclusions drawn from these models should be interpreted
      with great caution. To realistically simulate HIV spread in
      sub-Saharan Africa's general population nominally due to
      heterosexual HIV transmission, parameter values should be
      based on the most accurate data.</p>
