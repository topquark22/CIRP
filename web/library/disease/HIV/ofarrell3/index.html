      <h2>Sexual behaviour in Zulu men and women with genital ulcer
      disease.</h2>

      <p><b>O'Farrell N, Hoosen AA, Coetzee KD, van den Ende
      J</b></p>

      <p>City Health STD Clinic,<br />
       King Edward VIII Hospital,<br />
       Durban.</p>

      <p><b>OBJECTIVE--</b>To investigate patterns of sexual
      behaviour in men and women with genital ulcer disease (GUD)
      and their relevance to HIV-1 transmission.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS--</b>A sexual behaviour questionnaire was
      administered by the same interviewer to all participants who
      were also entered into a study of the microbial aetiology of
      GUD.</p>

      <p><b>SETTING--</b>City Health Sexually Transmitted Diseases
      Clinic, King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban, South Africa.</p>

      <p><b>PARTICIPANTS--</b>100 Zulu men and 100 Zulu women.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS--</b><span class="yellow">36 (%) of men and 36
      (%) of women had continued with sexual intercourse despite
      GUD</span>. Patients with donovanosis and secondary syphilis
      were more likely than those with other causes of GUD to have
      intercourse despite ulcers. During swab collection bleeding
      was observed from ulcers in 59 women and 26 men. Prostitutes
      were not identified and were rarely named as source contacts.
      Men had more sexual partners (190) than women (122) during
      the previous three months. Condom use was minimal. Men who
      migrated between urban and rural areas appeared to have the
      most sexual partners. Urban women had more partners than
      women from rural areas.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS--</b>Men and women with GUD are practising
      riskful sexual behaviour and could benefit from behaviour
      modification programmes. In this community men who travel
      between urban and rural areas and who present late with GUD
      that bleeds easily are probably the most important
      high-frequency HIV transmitter core group. A significant
      potential risk of blood to blood contact during sexual
      intercourse exists in patients with GUD.</p>
