      <p>Abstract:</p>

      <p>This study evaluated risk factors associated with
      prevalent HIV-1 infection among pregnant women in a
      semi-rural but densely populated area surrounding the town of
      Butare in Rwanda. Overall seroprevalence was 9.3% in 5690
      pregnant women who sought antenatal care at one of five
      health centres. Factors associated with higher seroprevalence
      of HIV-1 included history of multiple sexual partners,
      history of at least one sexually transmitted disease (STD),
      relatively high socioeconomic status (SES), being unmarried,
      young age at first pregnancy, and low gravidity. Women who
      had used oral contraceptives, smoked more than one cigarette
      per day, <span class="yellow">whose partners were
      circumcised</span>, and had had sex to support themselves
      were also at higher risk of being infected. A history of
      blood transfusion in the past 5 years was not associated with
      HIV-1 infection. History of multiple sexual partners, history
      of STD, high household income, <span class="yellow">partner
      circumcision</span>, and past oral contraceptive use remained
      strongly associated with HIV-1 infection even when
      simultaneously controlling for other covariates. Among
      legally married women who lacked sexual behaviour risk
      factors, history of STD, high SES, young age at first
      pregnancy, and low gravidity were significantly associated
      with HIV-1 seroprevalence.</p>
