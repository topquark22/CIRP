          A Longitudinal Study of Human Immunodeficiency Virus
          Transmission by Heterosexual Partners
        </div>

        Heterosexual Transmission of HIV</i>

      <p class="text1"><b>ABSTRACT</b></p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Background</i> Worldwide, the predominant
      mode of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission is
      heterosexual intercourse, but the risk of heterosexual
      transmission and the effectiveness of measures to prevent it
      are not well defined.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Methods</i> We conducted a prospective
      study of HIV-negative subjects whose only risk of HIV
      infection was a stable heterosexual relationship with an
      HIV-infected partner. Every six months the subjects were
      interviewed, tested for HIV, and counseled about safe sexual
      practices.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Results</i> A total of 304 HIV-negative
      subjects (196 women and 108 men) were followed for an average
      of 20 months. During the study, 130 couples (42.8 percent)
      ended their sexual relationships, most often because of the
      HIV-infected partner's illness or death. Of the 256 couples
      who continued to have sexual relations for more than three
      months after enrollment in the study, only 124 (48.4 percent)
      used condoms consistently for vaginal and anal intercourse.
      Among these couples, none of the seronegative partners became
      infected with HIV, despite a total of about 15,000 episodes
      of intercourse. Among the 121 couples who used condoms
      inconsistently, the rate of seroconversion was 4.8 per 100
      person-years (95 percent confidence interval, 2.5 to 8.4).
      Eleven couples refused to answer questions about condom use.
      The risk of transmission increased with advanced stages of
      HIV infection in the index partners (P&lt;0.02) and with
      genital infection in the HIV-negative partners (P&lt;0.04).
      Withdrawal to avoid ejaculation in the vagina had a
      protective effect in uninfected women (P&lt;0.02).</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Conclusions</i> <span
      class="yellow">Consistent use of condoms for heterosexual
      intercourse is highly effective in preventing the
      transmission of HIV.</span> Among couples not using condoms
      regularly, the risk of HIV transmission varies widely.</p>
