      <p><b>BACKGROUND.</b> Mathematical models of the AIDS
      epidemic have not been able to give accurate predictions
      about the size of the epidemic because it is not possible to
      obtain sufficiently accurate measurements of the factors that
      enable HIV transmission. The uncertainties inherent in models
      of the AIDS epidemic appear to limit their relevance to
      epidemiologists. However, it is shown here that the
      uncertainties need not prevent models being used to make
      reliable decisions about which preventive strategy will be
      most effective.</p>

      <p><b>METHOD.</b> A range of strategies are simulated in a
      model of the AIDS epidemic. The simulations are repeated as
      the value of what seems to be the most important uncertain
      factor, is varied. The effect of this variation on the
      effectiveness of each strategy is noted. In principle, the
      process could be repeated whilst all other uncertain factors
      are varied as well.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS.</b> Although varying one uncertain factor
      created enormous variation in the size of the epidemic, it is
      remarkable that for most preventive strategies the relative
      effectiveness of the strategies was barely altered. Hence for
      the most part the ranking of strategies in order of
      effectiveness is not affected by the area of uncertainty
      explored here. The results also highlight the potential
      effectiveness not only of general condom promotion, but also
      the use of circumcision and spermicides and general screening
      or targetted screening in sexually transmitted disease
      clinics.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS.</b> Epidemiological modelling may
      accurately rank the effectiveness of interventions although
      it may fail to predict the size of the epidemic.</p>
