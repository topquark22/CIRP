      <h4>Summary</h4>

      <p class="abstract"><b>Background</b> The probability of
      HIV-1 transmission per coital act in representative African
      populations is unknown. We aimed to calculate this
      probability overall, and to estimate how it is affected by
      various factors thought to influence infectivity.</p>

      <p class="abstract"><b>Methods</b> 174 monogamous couples, in
      which one partner was HIV-1 positive, were retrospectively
      identified from a population cohort in Rakai, Uganda.
      Frequency of intercourse and reliability of reporting within
      couples was assessed prospectively. HIV-1 seroconversion was
      determined in the uninfected partners, and HIV-1 viral load
      was measured in the infected partners. Adjusted rate ratios
      of transmission per coital act were estimated by Poisson
      regression. Probabilities of transmission per act were
      estimated by log-log binomial regression for quartiles of age
      and HIV-1 viral load, and for symptoms or diagnoses of
      sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the HIV-1-infected
      partners.</p>

      <p class="abstract"><b>Results</b> The mean frequency of
      intercourse was 8&middot;9 per month, which declined with age
      and HIV-1 viral load. Members of couples reported similar
      frequencies of intercourse. The overall unadjusted
      probability of HIV-1 transmission per coital act was
      0&middot;0011 (95% CI 0&middot;0008-0&middot;0015).
      Transmission probabilities increased from 0&middot;0001 per
      act at viral loads of less than 1700 copies/mL to
      0&middot;0023 per act at 38 500 copies/mL or more
      (p=0&middot;002), and were 0&middot;0041 with genital
      ulceration versus 0&middot;0011 without (p=0&middot;02).
      Transmission probabilities per act did not differ
      significantly by HIV-1 subtypes A and D, sex, STDs, or
      symptoms of discharge or dysuria in the HIV-1-positive
      partner.</p>

      <p class="abstract"><b>Interpretation</b> <span
      class="yellow">Higher viral load and genital ulceration are
      the main determinants of HIV-1 transmission per coital act in
      this Ugandan population.</span></p>

      1149-53</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p class="text1">The probability of HIV transmission per
      sexual act of vaginal intercourse, or infectivity (&gamma;),
      has been estimated from prospective studies of HIV-discordant
      partners or male contacts with prostitutes.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> Published estimates of transmission
      probabilities per act vary from &gamma;=0&middot;0001 to
      0&middot;0014 in US and European studies of discordant
      couples,<sup><a href="#n2">2-6</a></sup> and to
      &gamma;=0&middot;002 in Thai couples.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> However, higher transmission
      probabilities (&gamma;=0&middot;056-0&middot;100 per act)
      have been reported among men who had contacts with
      prostitutes in Thailand<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> and
      Kenya.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> The higher transmission
      probabilities associated with commercial sex might be
      attributable to the presence of other sexually transmitted
      diseases (STDs), which are thought to increase infectivity of
      or susceptibility to HIV,<sup><a href="#n2">2,8,9</a></sup>
      or to possible errors in reported contact frequency. Other
      factors that increase transmission include lower CD4 counts
      or AIDS in the HIV-positive index partner, and anal
      intercourse.<sup><a href="#n2">2,5,8,9</a></sup>
      Male-to-female HIV transmission is usually more efficient
      than female-to-male transmission in US and European
      populations, but the small numbers of HIV-positive female
      index partners limit conclusive sex-specific estimates of
      transmission probabilities per sex act.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2-5,10,11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">There are no data on per-contact probability
      of transmission from representative heterosexual couples in
      sub-Saharan Africa, and there is little information on the
      efficiency of transmission associated with HIV-1 viral
      subtypes.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> The eastern and
      southern African HIV epidemic is predominantly caused by
      HIV-1 subtypes A, C, and D, and the rapid progression of the
      epidemic in these parts of Africa might, in part, be
      associated with greater infectivity of these HIV-1
      subtypes.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> We assessed this
      possibility by examining transmission probabilities for
      subtypes A and D in Uganda. Conversely, some have postulated
      that the slower evolution of the HIV epidemic in western
      Africa might be due to the higher proportion of less
      transmissable recombinant HIV-1 subtypes in that
      region.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> To address these
      issues, we estimated the per-contact probability of HIV-1
      transmission among monogamous, heterosexual HIV-1-discordant
      couples in rural Rakai District, Uganda, in which the HIV-1
      epidemic is due to viral subtypes A and D. Estimates of HIV
      transmission probabilities rely on the accuracy of reports of
      the frequency of sexual intercourse,<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> and previous studies have not assessed
      the reliability of such data. Therefore, we also assessed the
      intracouple reliability of reports of sexual frequency and
      examined factors such as age, sex, and viral load, which
      might be associated with frequency of intercourse.</p>

      <h4>Participants and methods</h4>

      <h5>Participants</h5>

      <p class="text1">Data were collected between November, 1994,
      and October, 1998, in a community-randomised trial of STD
      control for AIDS prevention in the rural district of
      Rakai.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> The original trial
      enrolled 15127 individuals aged 15-59 years, who were
      followed up in their homes every 10 months.</p>

      <p class="text1">Among the 15127 participants, 8898 were
      married or in a consensual union, and information was
      requested on the identity of their partners. However, to
      maintain confidentiality, linkage of members of couples was
      not done during the course of the study. After completion of
      the trial in 1998, we linked members of couples and
      identified 415 couples who, at enrolment, were
      HIV-1-discordant (ie, one member of the couple was
      HIV-1-positive whereas the other was HIV-1-negative).<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> Both members of 174 such couples
      reported that they were monogamous and that the
      HIV-1-negative partner reported no extramarital partners
      during the period of observation. Data from these 174
      monogamous couples were used to estimate the probabilities of
      HIV-1 transmission per coital act, since it was assumed that
      the only source of infection in the HIV-1-negative partner
      would be the linked HIV-1-positive partner. The information
      on usual frequency of intercourse had been collected from
      both members of the couples, but for these analyses we used
      the sexual frequency information reported by the
      HIV-1-positive partner.</p>

      <p class="text1">Participants were enrolled as individuals,
      gave written informed consent at the time of enrolment, and
      were asked to give consent again at each follow-up visit. The
      consent form guaranteed complete confidentiality of the
      information provided. Voluntary HIV counselling and testing
      was offered, and condoms were promoted and provided free of
      charge by the project. In keeping with Ugandan governmental
      policy,<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> receipt of HIV
      results was encouraged but not mandatory. Individual HIV
      results were kept strictly confidential, but recipients were
      encouraged to share their results with their sexual partners.
      Involuntary disclosure of results is not permitted under
      Ugandan governmental policy. The trial was reviewed and
      approved by institutional review boards at the Uganda Virus
      Research Institute, the AIDS Research Subcommittee of the
      Uganda National Council for Science and Technology, Columbia
      and Johns Hopkins University human subjects review boards,
      and the National Institutes of Health Office for Protection
      from Research Risk. Safety during the trial was assessed by
      an independent data safety and monitoring board.</p>

      <h4>Methods</h4>

      <p class="text1">At each 10-month contact, biological samples
      were collected, and interview information obtained on
      sociodemographic characteristics and sexual behaviours,
      including the number of partners and use of condoms.
      Additionally, participants were asked about the usual
      frequency of intercourse with each partner. The specific
      question was: "When you have/had relationships with this
      partner, how frequently did you usually have intercourse, per
      day, per week and per month?". This information was used to
      estimate the number of coital acts per follow-up period.
      Information was also obtained on symptoms suggestive of STDs
      such as genital ulcers, discharge, or dysuria during the
      preceding period of risk.</p>

      <p class="text1">During the trial, participants were asked to
      provide a blood sample which was tested for HIV-1 by two
      different ELISAs (Vironostika HIV-1, Organon Teknika,
      Charlotte, NC, USA; and Cambridge Biotech, Worcester, MA,
      USA) with confirmation of discordant ELISAs by western
      blotting (HIV-1 Western Blot, Bio-Merieux-Vitek, St Louis,
      MO, USA). Serology was done for syphilis (Toluidine Red
      Unheated Serum Test [TRUST], New Horizons, Columbia, MD,
      USA), and TRUST-positive samples were confirmed by
      treponemal-specific tests (<i>Treponema pallidum</i>
      haemagglutination assay [Sera-Tek, Rujibero, Tokyo, Japan],
      or fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test [IFA Test
      System, Zeus Scientific, Raritan, NJ, USA]). Herpes simplex
      virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection was detected by an
      enzyme-linked immunodot assay.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> and
      <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> were detected by ligase chain
      reaction on urine samples (LCx Probe System, Abbott
      Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA). In women, self-collected
      vaginal swabs were used for culture of <i>Trichomonas
      vaginalis</i> (InPouch TV culture, BioMed Diagnostics, San
      Jose, CA, USA), and bacterial vaginosis was detected by
      quantitative morphology of gram-stained slides.</p>

      <p class="text1">The HIV-1 viral load for HIV-1-positive
      partners in discordant relationships was quantified by
      reverse-transcriptase PCR by use of an Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor
      1.5 Assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ, USA),
      which reliably quantifies the predominant Ugandan HIV-1
      subtypes A and D. HIV-1 subtypes were determined by peptide
      competition serotyping assay for V3-loop peptides of HIV-1
      subtypes A-F and O.18 The sample for the viral load assay was
      the one taken from the index HIV-1-positive individual at the
      10-month visit before detection of the seroconversion in the
      partner.<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup> This sample
      approximates to the HIV-1 viral load about 5 months before
      infection of the HIV-1-negative partner, assuming infection
      occurred uniformly throughout the interval of risk. Couples
      in whom no seroconversion occurred were matched to the
      seroconverting couples by age (to within 5 years), and sex of
      the HIV-1-positive and HIV-1-negative partners. The viral
      load assay in the HIV-1-positive partners of persistent
      discordant couples was determined for the sample obtained
      closest in time to that of the matched seroconverting
      partners. Thus, the viral loads of the HIV-1-positive
      transmitting partners were matched for age, sex, and time to
      the viral loads of the HIV-1-positive non-transmitting index
      partners. Repeat measurements of viral load were available
      for 43 non-transmitting, HIV-1-positive partners, so we used
      the mean of two or more viral loads to obtain a better
      measure of the mean exposure of the uninfected partner during
      the period of risk.</p>

      <p class="text1">Antiretroviral drugs were not available in
      Uganda at the time of the study. The efficacy of
      trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole prophylaxis for symptom-free
      HIV-1-infected individuals was not yet established, and
      because of concerns about resistance, the Ugandan Ministry of
      Health did not approve routine prophylaxis. Isoniazid
      prophylaxis for tuberculosis could not be provided because we
      were unable to exclude patients with active tuberculosis in
      this rural setting, and use of isoniazid in cases of active
      disease would rapidly select for resistant mycobacteria. The
      study provided STD treatment and general health care.</p>

      <h4>Statistical analysis</h4>

      <p class="text1">The statistical analysis first examined the
      reliability of the sexual frequency information reported by
      each member of a couple. We determined the within-couple
      differences in reported frequency of intercourse, and mean
      differences were assessed by paired t tests. We also
      estimated mean frequency of intercourse by sex, age, and
      viral load of the HIV-1-positive partner. The number of sex
      acts over the follow-up period was estimated from the
      intercourse frequency per month reported by the
      HIV-1-positive partner, multiplied by the number of months of
      follow-up for each couple, and then summed over all couples.
      In the Poisson regression,<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup>
      adjusted rate ratios of transmission per act were estimated,
      incorporating covariates for sex of the HIV-1-positive
      partner, quartiles of age (15-24, 25-29, 30-34, and
      <u>&gt;</u>35 years), quartiles of viral load (&lt;1700,
      1700-12499, 12500-38 500, and &gt;38 500 copies/mL), and STD
      symptoms and diagnoses in the HIV-1-positive partner.</p>

      <p class="text1">The probability of HIV-1 transmission per
      sex act was estimated as follows: the probability of
      transmission in the "i"th couple (Pi), depends on the number
      of acts during the follow up period (ni), and is
      1-(1-&gamma;)<sup>ni</sup>, where the infectivity (&gamma;),
      is the probability of transmission per act.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,20</a></sup> Overall infectivity and 95% CI were
      estimated without adjustment for covariates. Allowing the
      infectivity to depend on covariates (eg, quartiles of age and
      viral load) through a complementary log-log link leads to the
      regression model [log-log (1-P)]=log n<sub>i</sub> +
      b<sub>0</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub>, where
      b<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>1</sub> are vectors of regression
      coefficients and covariates, respectively. This model was
      fitted by use of statistical methods for generalised linear
      models, specifically binomial regression with a complementary
      log-log link and offset term log n<sub>i</sub> (SAS
      Institute, Cary, NC, USA).<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup>
      Various regression models were fitted with several
      covariates, including quartiles of age and HIV-1 viral load,
      sex, STD symptoms (genital ulcer disease, or discharge or
      dysuria), and STD diagnoses of the HIV-1-infected partner.
      Sex-specific models were also fitted for HIV-1-positive male
      circumcision status, and for HIV-1-positive female diagnoses
      of bacterial vaginosis and trichomonas. Covariates
      significant at p&lt;0&middot;1 were included in final models.
      These include single covariate models (separately for
      quartiles of age or viral load), and combined covariate
      models with both age and HIV-1 viral load, as well as
      combined models for genital ulcer disease and viral load.
      Goodness of fit was assessed by &chi;<sup><a
      href="#2">2</a></sup> test relative to a saturated model.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>

      <p class="text1">Among the 174 HIV-discordant monogamous
      couples, the HIV-1-positive partners had a median age of
      29&middot;0 years (mean 30&middot;2), and a median viral load
      of 12 476 copies/mL. In 97 couples, the male partner was
      HIV-1-positive, 17 of whom transmitted the virus to their
      wives (17&middot;5%). In 77 couples, the woman was the
      HIV-1-positive partner, 21 of whom transmitted HIV-1 to their
      husbands (27&middot;3%). HIV-1-infected men were
      significantly older than infected women (mean ages
      34&middot;0 years and 27&middot;1, respectively;
      p&lt;0&middot;0001).</p>

      <p class="text1">The mean reported frequency of intercourse
      was 8&middot;9 (median 8&middot;0) acts per month in the
      whole population. Among the 97 couples in which the man
      tested HIV-1 positive first, the infected men reported a mean
      of 8&middot;3 (SE 0&middot;70) acts of intercourse per month,
      and their HIV-1-negative female partners reported 8&middot;8
      (0&middot;62) acts per month (p=0&middot;49). In the 77
      couples in which the woman tested HIV-1 positive first, the
      infected women reported 9&middot;7 (0&middot;76) acts per
      month, and their HIV-1-negative male partners reported
      9&middot;8 (0&middot;62) acts per month (p=0&middot;67).
      Thus, there was relatively good agreement in the sexual
      frequency independently reported by both members of couples.
      There were no significant differences in the frequency of
      intercourse reported by infected men versus infected women
      (p&gt;0&middot;20). As shown in table 1, the frequency of
      intercourse declined with older age, although the overall
      trend was not significant (p=0&middot;2). Coital frequency
      was 10&middot;0 per month for ages 15-24, compared with
      7&middot;4 per month for individuals older than 35 years
      (p=0&middot;06). Among HIV-1-infected individuals, coital
      frequencies declined with higher viral loads: the mean
      frequency of intercourse was 10&middot;4 acts per month in
      individuals with viral loads of less than 1700 copies/mL,
      whereas the frequency was 7&middot;9 among those with viral
      loads greater than 38 500 copies/mL (p=0&middot;10).</p>

      Table 1: <b>Frequency of intercourse and relative risk of HIV
      transmission</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Table 1 shows the rate ratio of transmission
      per coital act estimated from Poisson regression. The rate
      ratio of transmission was lower for HIV-1-positive men than
      for HIV-1-positive women, although this difference was not
      significant. Compared with HIV-1-infected individuals aged
      35-59, the risk of transmission risk per sex act was higher
      among younger people aged 15-24 and 25-29 years. Although
      these point estimates were not significant, a 2 test for
      trend was significant (p=0&middot;04). Compared with
      individuals with HIV-1 viral loads of less than 1700
      copies/mL, the adjusted rate ratios showed a dose response
      relation at higher viral loads (table 1). Genital ulcer
      disease in the HIV-1-positive partner was associated with an
      increased risk of transmission per act (table 1), but other
      STD symptoms or diagnoses in the HIV-1-infected partners were
      not associated with an increased risk of transmission
      (results not shown). The risk of transmission was not
      significantly affected by the circumcision status of
      HIV-1-positive male partners. All of these couples were
      married or in a stable consensual union; 161 (92&middot;5%)
      had never used condoms, 11 (6&middot;3%) reported occasional
      condom use, and only two (1&middot;2%) reported consistent
      use. Thus, the effects of condom use on transmission risk
      could not be assessed in these monogamous couples.</p>

      <p class="text1">The overall probability of transmission per
      coital act, unadjusted for covariates, was 0&middot;0011
      (95%CI 0&middot;0008-0&middot;0015). Table 2 shows the
      probabilities of HIV-1 transmission per coital act (&gamma;),
      estimated from the complementary log-log binomial model for
      quartiles of age and HIV-1 viral load, and genital ulcer
      disease. The probability of transmission per act was highest
      for younger individuals aged 15-24 years and 25-29 years, and
      decreased at older ages. The transmission probability per act
      increased significantly with HIV viral load. At all viral
      loads, individuals aged 15-24 and 25-29 years had higher
      transmission probabilities per act than individuals older
      than 30 years, and in all age groups, the probability of
      transmission per act increased with viral load, but this
      association was most striking among the individuals younger
      than 30 years.</p>

      <p class="text1">HIV-1 subtyping was available for 155
      infected individuals. 31 were infected with subtype A
      (20&middot;0%), 103 subtype D (66&middot;4%), and the
      remaining 21 (13&middot;5%) had an atypical V3 subtype, which
      showed complex binding patterns. The transmission
      probabilities per coital act were 0&middot;0022 with subtype
      A, 0&middot;0019 with subtype D, and were lower with the
      atypical viruses (&gamma;=0&middot;0012). These differences
      were not significant (p=0&middot;26).</p>

      <p class="text1">The probability of transmission per act from

      was 0&middot;0013, compared with a transmission probability
      of 0&middot;0009 per act from HIV-1-positive men to
      HIV-1-negative women (p=0&middot;34). The probability of
      transmission per act was higher if genital ulcer disease was
      reported by the HIV-1-positive partner than if it was not
      (=0&middot;0041 vs =0&middot;0011; p=0&middot;02), and this
      higher transmission probability among individuals with
      ulceration was seen at all viral loads. The presence of
      genital discharge, dysuria, or laboratory STD diagnoses did
      not significantly affect the probability of transmission per
      act (results not shown).</p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p class="text1">The overall probability of transmission per
      coital act of 0&middot;0011 in the Rakai population is within
      the range of transmission probabilities per act
      (0&middot;0001-0&middot;0020), reported from prospective
      studies of European, north American, and Thai heterosexual
      couples.<sup><a href="#n2">2-7</a></sup> Condom use was low
      in the monogamous Ugandan couples, despite the fact that
      condoms and counselling were offered free of charge and
      promoted by the project, 56% of HIV-1-positive partners in
      these discordant relationships had requested and received HIV
      counselling, and 25% stated that they had informed their
      partners. This finding is consistent with previous Rakai
      studies that showed low condom use within marriage.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> In contrast, European, US, and Thai
      investigations found frequent condom use among
      HIV-1-discordant couples.<sup><a href="#n3">3-7</a></sup> The
      European and US epidemics are predominantly caused by HIV-1
      subtype B, the Thai epidemic by subtypes E and B, and the
      Ugandan epidemic by subtypes A and D. Therefore, since the
      transmission probabilities per act of sexual intercourse in
      these populations are similar, the generalised HIV-1 epidemic
      in Uganda is unlikely to be caused by a greater infectivity
      of subtypes A and D.</p>

      <p class="text1">We did not see a difference in the
      probability of transmission per act between HIV-1 subtypes A
      and D. Although transmission per act seemed to be lower with
      atypical V3 loop viruses, this association was not
      significant. We do not yet have genomic sequence data on
      these atypical viruses, so we cannot determine whether the
      atypical V3 loop represents A or D, non-A/D, or possibly
      recombinant viruses. Nevertheless, the finding of a possibly
      lower transmission probability per act in individuals with
      atypical viruses is compatible with the hypothesis that
      atypical and possibly recombinant HIV-1 viruses might be less
      infectious than viruses with typical V3 loop
      sequences.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">Ours and other estimates of transmission
      probabilities per coital act among heterosexual couples are
      much lower than those reported for contacts with prostitutes
      in Thailand and Kenya.<sup><a href="#8">8,9</a></sup>
      However, the Thai estimates were based on a cross-sectional
      study of prevalent HIV-1 among young military conscripts, and
      ascertained the life-time frequency of sexual contacts with
      prostitutes retrospectively.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>
      Recall of the frequency of commercial sexual contacts was
      likely to be subject to error, and under-reporting of the
      number of contacts could lead to overestimation of the
      per-contact risk. The Kenyan estimate was derived from a
      subgroup of men attending a STD clinic who reported a single
      contact with a sex worker.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>
      These estimates could also be biased by under-reporting of
      contact frequency. Alternatively, estimates from stable
      heterosexual couples might not reflect the probability of
      infection from a single unprotected act of intercourse with a
      randomly selected, high-risk partner, such as a
      prostitute.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> Some have suggested
      that coitus with prostitutes could be particularly hazardous
      owing to concurrent STDs or STD symptoms in the woman or her
      client.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="yellow">We found a higher
      transmission probability per act among individuals who
      reported genital ulceration</span>, but we did not see an
      increased probability of transmission per coital act among
      those with serological evidence of syphilis or HSV-2, and
      laboratory diagnoses of current gonorrhoea, chlamydia,
      bacterial vaginosis, or trichomonas infections, or among
      those reporting discharge or dysuria. With the exception of
      genital ulceration, the absence of an STD cofactor effect has
      been seen in previous analyses of HIV-1-discordant
      couples,<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> and the frequent
      HIV-1 exposure risk in such couples could possibly obscure an
      association between STDs and the per-contact probability of
      transmission. Additionally, our study had limited power to
      detect STD cofactor associations. Because STD diagnoses were
      based on samples obtained at the visit preceding the period
      of seroconversion risk, some infections such as gonorrhoea
      and chlamydia were too infrequent to assess, and symptom
      reporting embraced the whole period of risk. Therefore, STDs
      or symptoms at the exact time of seroconversion cannot be
      accurately determined. Also, serological tests for syphilis
      and HSV-2 reflect cumulative infections, so initial
      seroconversion (or HSV-2 recurrence) might not coincide with
      the timing of HIV-1 transmission.</p>

      <p class="text1">There was substantial heterogeneity in
      transmission probabilities in the Ugandan population:
      transmission probabilities per coital act were highest in
      younger individuals, and increased strikingly with HIV-1
      viral load. Frequency of intercourse cannot explain the
      change in infectivity with age because this factor was
      controlled for in the models. Higher infectivity could
      possibly be due to biological factors such as cervical ectopy
      in younger women which might facilitate HIV-1 transmission.
      Partial immunity in older HIV-1-positive individuals or
      selective resistance to infection associated with repeated
      prior HIV-1 exposure in older HIV-1-negative partners might
      also be factors. Intercourse among younger people might be
      associated with more genital trauma, but we have no direct
      data on this issue. Anal intercourse is associated with a
      higher probability of transmission per sexual act,<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> but anal intercourse is not practised
      in this population (fewer than 1% of individuals reported
      anal sex, and anorectal STDs are not seen). Other
      investigators have reported that the probability of HIV-1
      transmission per sexual contact is higher among people who
      are immunocompromised or who have lower CD4 counts,<sup><a
      href="#n2">2,5,9-11</a></sup>and this possibility is
      consistent with our finding of higher transmission
      probabilities per coital act associated with increased HIV-1
      viral loads.</p>

      <p class="text1">Studies of discordant couples in Europe and
      the USA generally report higher male-to-female transmission
      efficiency than female-to-male, although these investigations
      had few female HIV-1-positive index partners.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2-5</a></sup> By contrast, we found a higher
      transmission probability per act from women to men than from
      men to women, which, although not significant, was consistent
      with previous incidence data from Rakai among
      HIV-1-discordant couples <sup><a href="#n15">15,22</a></sup>
      and in the general population.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup> Similarly, higher female-to-male
      transmission has been reported from other less-developed
      countries<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> Several African
      studies show that HIV-1 prevalence and incidence are higher
      in young women than in young men,<sup><a
      href="#12">12</a></sup> but these data suggest that the
      sex-specific differentials in HIV-1 prevalence are unlikely
      to be caused by sex differences in the efficiency of HIV-1
      transmission.</p>

      <p class="text1">The estimates of transmission probabilities
      per coital act rely on the accuracy of the information on
      sexual frequency (over-reporting of coital frequency leads to
      underestimation of the per-contact risk, and under-reporting
      of sexual frequency leads to overestimation of risk per sex
      act). Other studies of transmission probabilities per act
      have not assessed the reliability of the number of reported
      sex acts, and commonly use grouped data on sexual frequencies
      in analysis. We believe the reported frequencies of
      intercourse in our study are reliable since there was
      agreement in the number of sex acts independently reported by
      partners in these monogamous relationships, which suggests
      consistency of reporting within couples, as has been seen in
      other studies.<sup><a href="#n24">24,25</a></sup> Also,
      reported sexual frequency declined with age, as is seen in
      most populations,<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> and the
      frequency of intercourse is compatible with that reported in
      other eastern African rural societies.<sup><a
      href="#26">26,27</a></sup> Thus, we have no evidence to
      suggest that the data on sexual frequency introduced bias
      into the estimates of probabilities of transmission per sex
      act.</p>

      <p class="text1">The overall, unadjusted probability of HIV-1
      transmission per coital act is 0&middot;0011 in this Ugandan
      population, and greater infectivity of predominant HIV-1
      viral subtypes is unlikely to account for the explosive HIV-1
      epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. <span
      class="yellow">Transmission probability per act varies
      greatly with the HIV-1 viral load of the HIV-1-infected
      partner, which suggests that interventions to reduce viral
      load could reduce transmission.</span><sup><a
      href="#n15">15,28</a></sup> <span class="yellow">Younger age
      and genital ulceration also increased the probability of
      transmission per act.</span></p>
