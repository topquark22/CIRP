                               Abstract:
OBJECTIVE:  To examine the relationship between HIV infection 
and circumcision.  METHODS:  An analysis of two studies done in
New York City's Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Clinics.  
Study No. 1 is a case-control study of 352 men attending 2 STD 
clinics from 8/87-3/88.  Study NO. 2 is a cross-sectional study 
of 1,374 men attending 2 STD clinics from 12/86 to 12/88.  All 
study participants were interviewed.  Circumcision status was 
determined by self-report (both studies) and by physical exam 
in Study No. 1.  RESULTS:  The prevalence of circumcision status
by physical exam in Study No. 1 was 39.1%.  In Sudy No. 2 the 
prevalence of circumcsino by self-report was 52.0%.  The 
differences in circumcision rates can be explained both by the 
racial compositions of the two studies and by misclassification 
in those who were circumcised (17.7% vs 8.4%).  The prevalence of
HIV infection in Study No1 was 18.2%, and in Study No. 2 was 13.2%.
Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, race, homosexuality,
number of sexual partners, drug use, diagnosis and circumcision 
status (physical exam and self-report) was done for both study 
populations.  There was no association between circumcision status 
and HIV infection.  CONCLUSIONS:  In two studies in NYC STD clinics,
with a total of 1,726 men, no independent relationship was found 
between circumcision status and HIV infection.
