      <h2>Issues associated with the introduction of
      circumcision<br />
       into a non-circumcising society</h2>

      <p class="text1">A team lead by Kebaabetswe propose the
      introduction of infant circumcision in Botswana, based
      on:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>a survey of its acceptability to Batswana (people of
        Botswana)</li>

        <li>its practice in certain Western nations, and</li>

        <li>its alleged value in preventing HIV infection.<sup><a
        href="#n1">1</a></sup></li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text2">There are several medical, psychological,
      sexual, social, ethical, and legal problems with this
      proposal.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="head">Medical
      effects</span><br />
       Male neonatal circumcision is not an innocuous procedure.
      There are many complications ranging from trivial to life
      threatening. Complications generally include bleeding,
      infection, and surgical accident, including penile necrosis
      and penile amputations.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      Bleeding or infection can progress to death.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3 4</a></sup> It is difficult to control
      complications with mass circumcisions.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> Circumcision excises significant
      amounts of nerve bearing penile skin and mucosa, especially
      the ridged band structure near the mucocutaneous
      boundary.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> The protective
      effects of circumcision against HIV remain
      controversial.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> UNAIDS has not
      accepted circumcision as a useful public health measure.</p>

      <p class="text2">In neighbouring South Africa, many children
      are infected with HIV.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> This is
      attributed to unsafe health care.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision creates an open wound through
      which infection may proceed.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> It
      is not clear that safe aseptic circumcisions can be delivered
      in Botswana. It is possible that mass circumcision may worsen
      the epidemic.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="head">Psychological
      effects</span><br />
       Psychological manifestations of circumcision have been an
      area of study at Bond University.</p>

      <p class="text2">Neonatal circumcision is an intensely
      painful, traumatic, and stressful operation.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> General anaesthesia is unsafe in the
      new-born. Available methods of anaesthesia are only partially
      effective.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> Circumcised
      infants show hypersensitivity to pain suggestive of
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> Our study of the incidence of PTSD
      in the Philippines found extensive PTSD in circumcised
      boys.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> PTSD secondary to
      neonatal circumcision has been documented in adult
      males.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> Victims of trauma tend
      to re-enact their trauma either on themselves or others in a
      cycle of violence.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup>
      Circumcised males may rely on psychological defence
      mechanisms such as rationalisation and denial, and strongly
      avoid thoughts, feelings, or conversations about
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">There are additional concerns. The state of
      the phallus is closely related to a man&rsquo;s sense of
      wellbeing.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> Men who were
      circumcised neonatally may feel unhappy about being
      circumcised, experience significant anger, sadness, feeling
      incomplete, cheated, hurt, concerned, frustrated, abnormal,
      and vio-lated. In addition, circumcised men may suffer from
      resultant low self esteem,<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup>
      which frequently can result in a host of disordered
      behaviours.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision may be difficult to eradicate
      from a society once it is introduced. In addition, to the
      re-enactment described above,<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup>
      Goldman reports that circumcised men tend to defend the
      practice.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> Circumcised doctors
      tend to develop intellectual arguments to support genital
      cutting.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> Fathers who are
      circumcised may adamantly insist on a son&rsquo;s
      circumcision in an emotional defence against their own
      painful feelings of grief for a lost body part and reduced
      sexual function.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> Kebaabetswe
      <i>et al</i> (p 217) reported that, &lsquo;&lsquo;Being
      circumcised was the only significant predictor for a man who
      would definitely or probably circumcise a male
      child.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="head">Sexual
      effects</span><br />
       As noted above, circumcision excises large amounts of skin
      and mucosa from the penis. The removal of the prepuce
      tightens the remaining skin and makes it relatively immobile.
      Since stimulation of the sex nerves normally occurs by
      movement of the mobile skin, this further desensitises the
      penis,<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> perhaps even more than
      the removal of the ridged band of erogenous nerves noted by
      Taylor.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> Excision of sexual
      nerve endings necessarily reduces sensory input. A decrease
      in sensation may therefore decrease the sexual
      response.<sup><a href="#n19">19 20</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Male circumcision also may adversely affect
      female sexual response. A survey of women found that they
      were markedly less likely to have an orgasm with a
      circumcised partner.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="head">Social
      effects</span><br />
       There has been little study of social problems that may
      occur when entire cohorts of males are circumcised and
      consequently most of the men in a society bear physical and
      psychological wounds associated with circumcision. We might
      expect more dependence on alcohol to relieve the symptoms of
      PTSD. Low self esteem may generate a feeling of shame. Shame
      may generate problems with relationship dissatisfaction,
      poorer health, depression, drug use, and loneliness.
      In-creased sexual incompatibility and marital problems in
      circumcised societies might be expected as a result of
      reduced penile sensory input, increased sexual dysfunction,
      PTSD, and low self esteem among circumcised men.<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup> Increased antisocial behaviour may
      also be expected. Thus, we might expect to see higher levels
      of domestic violence, rape, child sexual abuse, suicide, and
      theft.<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="head">Human rights</span><br />
       The fight against HIV-AIDS requires the careful protection
      of human rights.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> Among these
      human rights one finds the rights to security of the person
      and protection from degrading treatment. The unnecessary
      excision of normal human tissue<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup>
      from unconsenting minor children is an obvious violation of
      the security of the person.</p>

      <p class="text2">Through amputation of erogenous tissue,
      circumcision necessarily diminishes sexual sensation and
      function as described above and may constitute degrading
      treatment.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="head">Ethics</span><br />
       Doctors have a duty of care to behave in an ethical fashion.
      Among other requirements, they are expected to respect the
      human rights of their child patients.<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> Circumcision has been shown to be a
      violation of the child&rsquo;s human rights and, clearly,
      many ethical doctors are unwilling to carry out destructive
      circumcisions on normal, healthy boys. The British Medical
      Association recognises the right to conscientious objection
      to the performance of circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="head">Law</span><br />
       Male circumcision is not unlawful, but valid consent must be
      obtained. This may be a problem in the case of circumcision
      per-formed on unconsenting minors, in the absence of any
      medical indication. Cases involving the right of parents to
      consent to the non-therapeutic surgical ster-ilisation of a
      child have been heard in several nations.<sup><a
      href="#n25">25 26</a></sup> The cases agree that, in the
      absence of any medical indication, parents are not empowered
      to consent to the non-therapeutic, irreversible, surgical
      alteration of their child&rsquo;s genitals. In the absence of
      a valid consent, a circumcision may constitute an
      assault.<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="head">Conclusion</span><br />
       The value of male circumcision in preventing HIV infection
      remains unclear. Non-sterile circumcisions may increase the
      risk. The proposal by Kebaabetswe and colleagues for the
      introduction of circumcision into Botswana is seriously
      flawed, and is irresponsible in failing to place the emphasis
      on safe sex practices. As described here, there are many
      medical, sexual, psychological, social, human rights,
      ethical, and legal aspects that must be considered. Reliance
      on circumcision to prevent HIV transmission is wishful
      fantasy, and can only result in a calamitous worsening of the
      HIV-AIDS epidemic.</p>

      <p class="text2">Once started, circumcision tends to persist
      even when the need is over. Circumcision was introduced more
      than 100 years ago in Western nations on the grounds than it
      would prevent masturbation, which would prevent mental and
      emotional illness. That, of course, is no longer believed,
      but the practice of circumcision persists and has proved
      difficult to eradicate although progress is being made. The
      incidence of circumcision is declining in Western nations.
      The Department of Health of the Philippines is trying to
      discourage circumcision (called
      &lsquo;&lsquo;tule&rsquo;&rsquo;) in that nation where it has
      persisted.<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup> The practice of
      neonatal circumcision in certain Western countries such as
      the United States does not constitute a valid reason for
      introducing neonatal circumcision in Botswana.</p>

      <p>Extreme care must be taken in a decision to introduce
      circumcision into a society.</p>
