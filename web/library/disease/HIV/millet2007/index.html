      <p><b>Abstract:</b><br />
       Objective: To examine characteristics of circumcised and
      uncircumcised Latino and black men who have sex with men
      (MSM) in the United States and assess the association between
      circumcision and HIV infection</p>

      <p>Methods: Using respondent-driven sampling, 1154 black MSM
      and 1091 Latino MSM were recruited from New York City,
      Philadelphia, and Los Angeles. A 45-minute computer-assisted
      interview and a rapid oral fluid HIV antibody test (OraSure
      Technologies, Bethlehem, PA) were administered to
      participants.</p>

      <p>Results: Circumcision prevalence was higher among black
      MSM than among Latino MSM (74% vs. 33%; P &lt; 0.0001).
      Circumcised MSM in both racial/ethnic groups were more likely
      than uncircumcised MSM to be born in the United States or to
      have a US-born parent. Circumcision status was not associated
      with prevalent HIV infection among Latino MSM, black MSM,
      black bisexual men, or black or Latino men who reported being
      HIV-negative based on their last HIV test. Further,
      circumcision was not associated with a reduced likelihood of
      HIV infection among men who had engaged in unprotected
      insertive and not unprotected receptive anal sex.</p>

      <p>Conclusions: In these cross-sectional data, there was no
      evidence that being circumcised was protective against HIV
      infection among black MSM or Latino MSM.</p>
