      <h3>Abstract</h3>

      <p><b>Objectives:</b> Previous studies have shown that HIV
      can be transcytosed across epithelial cell line barriers;
      however, there is no information concerning primary
      epithelial cells. Our objectives were to determine if primary
      epithelial cells have the ability to harbor and transmit HIV
      and to determine if primary epithelial cells can transcytose
      HIV.</p>

      <p><b>Methods:</b> For HIV transmission, primary prostate
      epithelial cells (PrEC) and two epithelial cervical carcinoma
      cell lines, ME-180 and CaSKI, were inoculated with HI and
      washed. Various concentrations of resting or activated
      CD8-depleted PBMCs were added before or after the epithelial
      cells were trypsinized.</p>

      <p>Supernatants were monitored every 2 days for HIV
      expression using a p24 ELISA. DNA PCR was performed on the
      pot-trypsinized epithelial cells to evaluate proviral
      integration. For HIV transcytosis, the epithelial cells were
      cultured on 0.4 mM transwell filters until confluent (day 7).
      Cell-free HIV (LAI; MOI .001) or cell-associated (18 hours,
      TNF a-induced OM10.1 cell line) HIV was added to the apical
      side. The basolateral medium was sampled for HIV p24.</p>

      <p><b>Results:</b> Without trypsinization, HIV was recovered
      by day 3 from ME-180 and CaSKI cell lines and by day 7 from
      the PrEC cells y activated PBMCs but not by resting PBMCs.
      For all epithelial cells, at least 5 [times] 105 activated
      PBMCs (2 PBMCs to 1 epithelial cell) were required for HIV
      recovery. Trypsinization of the epithelial cells resulted in
      a loss of recoverable HIV from PEC, but not ME-180 and CaSKI
      cells, even though all transiently had provirus. We next
      explored HIV transcytosis. PrEC developed a tight-junction
      monolayer as seen by high transepithelial resistance (433 W
      [times] cm2). CaSKI cells developed a moderate tight-junction
      monolayer (50 W [times] cm2), while the ME-180 cells failed
      to make a tight-junction monolayer. Consequently, cell-free
      HIV was readily transcytosed through ME-180 cells by 1 hour
      and through CaSKI cells by 2 hours. Cell-associated virus
      began to transcytose through ME-180 and CaSKI cells by 24
      hours. Importantly, PrEC did not transcytose cell-free or
      cell-associated HIV.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusions:</b> Both primary and immortalized
      epithelial cells have the capacity to transiently sequester
      HIV, but primary (PrEC) cells are incapable of transmissin.
      Further, formation of a tight-junction monolayer by PrEC did
      not allow transcytosis of cell-free or cell-associated HIV.
      <span class="yellow">Collectively, these data suggest that
      the in vivo mucosal epithelial barrier protects against HIV
      transmission, and that factors, such as STDs, affecting the
      integrity of transepithelial tight-junctions may allow viral
      entry and thus have implications for sexual
      transmission.</span></p>
