      <h2>Neonatal circumcision does not reduce HIV/AIDS infection
      rates</h2>

      <h4>D Sidler, J Smith, H Rode</h4>

      <p class="text1">Non-therapeutic, non-religious circumcision
      is the surgical procedure most commonly published
      about,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> but substantive
      indications are lacking. Since its introduction to the USA
      during the Victorian period, when it was thought that it
      prevented masturbation,<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> medical
      justifications for the procedure progressed to prevention of
      various infective conditions (sexually transmitted diseases,
      penile and cervical cancer) and controlling of the sexual
      drive. Recent Joint United Nations Programme on
      HIV/AIDS/World Health Organization (UNAIDS/WHO) policy
      proposes male circumcision for the prevention of
      HIV/AIDS.<sup><a href="#n3">3,4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">HIV/AIDS in Africa is mainly spread by
      multiple concurrent heterosexual relationships,<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> compounded by female
      subjugation<sup><a href="#n6">6,7</a></sup> and
      poverty.<sup><a href="#n8">8,9</a></sup> Condoms, although
      highly protective, are infrequently used, particularly among
      circumcised males.<sup><a href="#n10">10,11</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The HIV/AIDS crisis demands extraordinary
      curtailment measures. It is, however, questionable how
      circumcision, and particularly neonatal circumcision, could
      achieve such a goal. A rational and critical analysis of the
      scientific evidence<sup><a href="#n12">12-14</a></sup> ought
      to conclude that non-therapeutic infant circumcision is
      merely the medicalisation of an old ritual that should not,
      in the 21st century, be advocated as prevention strategy for
      HIV/AIDS. Repeated publications of matching opinions do not
      necessarily lead to solid scientific evidence and
      policies.</p>

      <p class="text2">They rather suggest that the peer review
      process of journal publication may be unreliable.<sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup> Information overload can cause
      limitations, for example influencing expert and public
      opinion with ideological and pseudoscientific content.<sup><a
      href="#n16">16-18</a></sup> This context and such therapeutic
      misconceptions contribute to circumcision still being
      practised as a non-therapeutic infant procedure. This mainly
      applies to English-speaking countries, where circumcision
      appears to have become a medicalised ritual. In contrast, in
      Europe non-therapeutic circumcision is not the norm.</p>

      <p class="text2">Many reviews<sup><a
      href="#n19">19-21</a></sup> question the necessity of
      non-therapeutic infant circumcision, showing it to have
      neither short- nor long-term medical benefits. It has been
      suggested that parents should be granted responsibility and
      final decisionmaking authority after having thoroughly
      considered all the relevant facts.<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> The reported increase in demand for
      preventive circumcision, long before publication of results
      of the three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in South
      Africa,<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> Kenya<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup> and Uganda<sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup> that have shown that circumcision is
      partially protective against HIV, suggests that informed
      proxy consent, within the context of the HIV/AIDS epidemic
      and the prevalence of poverty and ignorance, has to be
      seriously questioned.<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup> The
      desperate hope and need for action of people ravaged by
      HIV/AIDS, rather than solid scientific evidence, may be
      driving the increased demand for preventive circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">A recent Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
      and WHO report<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> confirms
      previous reports that circumcision does not prevent sexually
      transmitted diseases (STDs).<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup>
      Teens 15 years and older in the USA have the highest rate of
      STDs in any industrialised country and half will contract a
      sexually transmitted disease by age 25, despite two-thirds of
      young males having been circumcised. Such reports suggest
      that the social experiment of circumcision to prevent STDs,
      including HIV, has already failed in the USA, which has the
      highest rate of non-therapeutic infant circumcision in
      industrialised countries and the highest rate of HIV in the
      developed world.<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> Before the
      three controversial RCTs<sup><a href="#n22">22-24</a></sup>
      were published, a Cochrane Systematic Review<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup> concluded that there was
      insufficient evidence to suggest use of mass circumcision to
      prevent HIV/AIDS. Irrespective of this review, advocates of
      mass roll-out of prophylactic circumcision repeatedly
      published the benefits of infant non-therapeutic circumcision
      and either omitted to mention the Cochrane Systematic Review
      or misrepresented it.<sup><a href="#n29">29-31</a></sup>
      Since the Cochrane Collaboration&rsquo;s Review, infant
      non-therapeutic circumcision in South Africa has become
      illegal,<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup> making the
      discussion of forced infant circumcision moot, at least in
      this country.</p>

      <p class="text2">Research ethics committees appear to have
      accepted research proposals such as that of Auvert <i>et
      al.</i><sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> without considering
      the historical context within which non-therapeutic
      circumcision became so prevalent in English-speaking
      countries. Omitting the Cochrane Systematic Review in the
      research protocol and final publication raises serious
      concern. Similarly, peerreviewed journals have repeatedly
      accepted papers that omit contradictory evidence. A journal
      reviewer for the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>,
      <i>JAMA</i>, <i>Archives of Disease in Childhood</i> and
      <i>Pediatrics</i> stated under oath that he had never
      accepted any paper attempting to demonstrate the inefficacy
      of infant circumcision as a prevention tool.<sup><a
      href="#n33">33</a></sup> It therefore becomes increasingly
      important to question the many and similar scientific and
      media publications promoting the benefit of mass roll-out of
      circumcision as a strategy for prevention of HIV/ AIDS.</p>

      <p class="text2">The use of mass circumcision to curb HIV in
      Africa is illadvised, and may worsen the crisis while
      expending scarce resources that could be applied better for
      more effective preventive measures. Neonatal non-therapeutic
      circumcision to combat the HIV crisis in Africa is neither
      medically nor ethically justifiable on the basis of current
      medical evidence or universally recognised ethical and human
      rights principles. The call for neonatal non-therapeutic
      circumcision for prevention of HIV by some members of the
      Catholic Church<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup> suggests
      misunderstanding of the local context, and supporting genital
      surgery on newborn boys but discouraging the more effective
      preventive measure of condom use lacks logic.</p>

      <p class="text2">Neither an explanation for the outcome of
      the three RCTs nor evidence that they are applicable and
      repeatable in real-world situations exists.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> No field test has been performed to
      test the theory or to analyse its effectiveness, cost and
      complications. To roll out a new programme based on limited
      evidence, implying to the African public that circumcision
      could reduce the male likelihood of contracting HIV by 50 -
      60%, is inconclusive and misleading.<sup><a
      href="#n34">34,35</a></sup> Coercing adults and forcing
      infants to be circumcised is unethical. Safe-sex campaigns
      could accomplish much greater reductions in infection
      frequency, as was successfully achieved in Brazil, Thailand
      and Uganda, where three mainly non-circumcising countries
      reduced the HIV epidemic through the ABC approach
      (abstinence, be faithful, condomise) alone.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Australian Federation of AIDS
      Organizations (AFAO) concurs that male circumcision has no
      role in the Australian HIV epidemic.<sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup> There is no demonstrated benefit of
      circumcision in men who have sex with men. Consistent condom
      use, not circumcision, is the most effective means of
      reducing female-to-male transmission, and vice versa; and
      African data on circumcision are context-specific and cannot
      be extrapolated to the Australian epidemic. Comparing
      Australia to America, they conclude: &lsquo;The USA has a
      growing heterosexual epidemic and very high rates of
      circumcision. Circumcision does not prevent HIV &ndash; in
      high prevalence areas, it <i>reduced the risk</i> of
      female-to-male transmission. HIV acquisition rates were
      nevertheless high in both the circumcised and the
      non-circumcised groups involved in the trials.&rsquo; The
      Royal Australasian College of Physicians policy statement on
      circumcision could not recommend circumcision to help stop
      the epidemic: &lsquo;How much circumcision could contribute
      to ameliorate the current epidemic of HIV is
      uncertain.&rsquo;<sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The French Conseil National du SIDA issued a
      report<sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup> to clarify the issues
      following the mass media reporting and misreporting of the
      three African RCTs. &lsquo;The studies are generating debate
      among the scientific community and are also raising a number
      of questions with regard to its implementation and role in
      terms of public health strategy. Implementation of male
      circumcision as part of a draft of preventative measures
      could destabilize health care delivery and at the same time
      confuse existing prevention messages. The addition of a new
      tool could actually cause a result opposite to that which was
      originally intended.&rsquo;<sup><a
      href="#n37">37</a></sup></p>

      <h3>Circumcision could increase the risk of HIV</h3>

      <p class="text1">Promoting circumcision might worsen the
      problem by creating a false sense of security and protection
      and therefore undermining safe sex practices and condom usage
      among men and their partners.<sup><a
      href="#n39">39,40</a></sup> If the 50 - 60% protective effect
      the RCTs claim is true, and if all African males were to be
      circumcised over the next 15 years, the number of infections
      would only be reduced by 8% and related deaths by 1%.<sup><a
      href="#n40">40,41</a></sup> Men who have sex with men are not
      protected from HIV, even if they are circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n42">42-44</a></sup> Furthermore, the role of
      commercial sex workers and sexual networks has not been
      adequately addressed in plans to stop the epidemic.<sup><a
      href="#n45">45,46</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Another serious concern is the breakdown of
      sexual socialisation of the youth, coupled with the
      continuous erosion of the role that circumcision initiation
      schools once played. A norm appears to be emerging where
      circumcision is increasingly regarded as a gateway and right
      to unprotected sex<sup><a href="#n47">47,48</a></sup> rather
      than a marker for assuming responsibility in sexual
      behaviour. This should give pause for thought concerning the
      practical efficacy of research, which shows some medical
      benefit to circumcised males in the form of protecting them
      against HIV while discarding the attendant socialisation
      within the customary context.</p>

      <p class="text2">Further cause for concern is the
      confirmation of a preliminary report stating that women have
      an up to 60% increased cumulative risk of contracting HIV
      over the period of 24 months if their male partner is HIV
      positive and has been circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n49">49,50</a></sup> Female opinion has generally been
      disregarded in the debate on male circumcision as a method
      for HIV prevention. Informal discussions with women reveal a
      range of concerns, preferences and views that researchers and
      governments would do well to consider before drawing up plans
      for rolling out a national mass circumcision programme.
      African women are concerned that such a programme will give
      their male partners another excuse not to use condoms.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11,51</a></sup></p>

      <h3>Potential complications and harms from
      circumcision<sup><a href="#n52">52</a></sup></h3>

      <p class="text1">Risks and harms of circumcision have to be
      considered before any mass circumcision programme could be
      adopted. A neonatal circumcision complication rate of 20.2%
      was found in Nigeria;<sup><a href="#n53">53</a></sup> risks
      of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and
      other infections in newborns increase;<sup><a
      href="#n54">54-57</a></sup> and even deaths and severe
      complications resulting in lifelong disability have
      occurred.<sup><a href="#n58">58</a></sup> Meatal stenosis
      affects 5 - 10% of circumcised infant males. Sexual
      side-effects and sensitivity loss,<sup><a
      href="#n59">59,60</a></sup> as well as psychological
      consequences including an infant analogue of post-traumatic
      stress syndrome<sup><a href="#n61">61,62</a></sup> and
      addictive behaviours,<sup><a href="#n63">63</a></sup> are
      some more controversial claims. Whether controversial or not
      these claims need to be carefully considered, particularly in
      the context where neonatal circumcision is performed without
      analgesia or anaesthesia.<sup><a href="#n64" />64</sup></p>

      <h3>A &lsquo;social vaccine&rsquo;</h3>

      <p class="text1">Education, female economic independence,
      safe sex practices and consistent condom use are proven
      effective measures against HIV transmission. Such a strategy
      dropped the HIV adult prevalence rate in Uganda from over 30%
      in 1992 to 14% in 1995 to below 8% in 2000.<sup><a
      href="#n65">65</a></sup> Consistent condom use reduces
      lifetime risk of contracting HIV by 20%,<sup><a
      href="#n66">66</a></sup> as opposed to 8% for
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n40">40,41</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">It is the responsibility of those who insist
      on circumcision as a globalised roll-out for HIV prevention
      to prove that circumcision will not cause any short- or
      long-term harm. Such responsibility would imply registration
      of all circumcisions for HIV prevention and the collection of
      data, particularly of complications, including the rate of
      HIV acquisition of male and their female partners. Such
      responsibility would mean lifelong follow-up.</p>

      <p class="text2">Parents should not be misled into thinking
      that the results of studies performed on adult African males
      could be extrapolated to health policy for newborns. It is
      unprecedented and unethical for a prophylactic surgery to be
      offered as a &lsquo;health benefit&rsquo; to parents of
      newborns to reduce the risk of a disease acquired in
      adulthood for which there are safer, less invasive, less
      expensive, and proven prevention methods available.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> Newborns are not sexually active and
      not at risk of sexually contracted diseases. Furthermore, by
      the time today&rsquo;s newborns are sexually active, a
      vaccine or other methods of treating the disease may be
      available. They may prefer to retain their foreskin and as
      adults choose vaccination and safe sex practices, including
      using condoms.</p>

      <p class="text2">Infant circumcision is not a common African
      tradition. To our knowledge the Coptic Christians and black
      Jews in Ethiopia and Eritrea are the only African peoples who
      practise neonatal circumcision. Each circumcising African
      tribe has a specific and very different technique and ritual
      of circumcision. The introduction of an Americanised neonatal
      circumcision could be considered cultural and religious
      interference, and even be construed as medical
      colonisation.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p class="text2">Male non-therapeutic infant circumcision is
      neither medically nor ethically justified as an HIV
      prevention tool. Circumcision is not equivalent to successful
      immunisation, is being practised with decreasing frequency in
      English-speaking countries, and is becoming illegal in South
      Africa under the new Children&rsquo;s Act.<sup><a
      href="#n32">32</a></sup> There are far more effective
      prevention tools costing considerably less and offering
      better HIV reduction outcomes than circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Finally, the WHO and UNAIDS appear to be
      basing these multi-million-dollar prevention programmes on
      limited and in some instances biased information. In order to
      prevent confusion and parents making misguided decisions on
      behalf of their infants, and to offer effective help in
      alleviating the suffering that is being created by HIV/AIDS,
      a much broader review process would be called for. Such a
      process would involve more objective scientific opinion, and
      the involvement of a representative panel of African experts,
      such as paediatric surgeons and neonatologists.</p>
