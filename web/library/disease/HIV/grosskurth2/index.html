      <h2>Impact of improved treatment of sexually transmitted
      diseases on HIV infection in rural Tanzania: randomised
      controlled trial.</h2>

      <p>A randomised trial was done to evaluate the impact of
      improved sexually transmitted disease (STD) case management
      at primary health care level on the incidence of HIV
      infection in the rural Mwanza region of Tanzania. HIV
      incidence was compared in six intervention communities and
      six pair-matched comparison communities. A random cohort of
      about 1000 adults aged 15-54 years from each community was
      surveyed at baseline and at follow-up 2 years later.
      Intervention consisted of establishment of an STD reference
      clinic, staff training, regular supply of drugs, regular
      supervisory visits to health facilities, and health education
      about STDs. 12,537 individuals were recruited. Baseline HIV
      prevalences were 3.8% and 4.4% in the intervention and
      comparison communities, respectively. At follow-up, 8845
      (71%) of the cohort were seen. Of those initially
      seronegative, the proportions seroconverting over 2 years
      were 48 of 4149 (1.2%) in the intervention communities and 82
      of 4400 (1.9%) in the comparison communities. HIV incidence
      was consistently lower in the intervention communities in all
      six matched pairs. Allowing for the community-randomised
      design and the effects of confounding factors, the estimated
      risk ratio was 0.58 (95% CI 0.42-0.79, p = 0.007). No change
      in reported sexual behaviour was observed in either group.
      <span class="yellow">We conclude that improved STD treatment
      reduced HIV incidence by about 40% in this rural
      population.</span> This is the first randomised trial to
      demonstrate an impact of a preventive intervention on HIV
      incidence in a general population.</p>
