      <h2>Lack of Autodisable Syringe Use and Health Care
      Indicators Are Associated With High HIV Prevalence: An
      International Ecologic Analysis</h2>

      <p><b>Purpose</b><br />
       A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that unsafe
      health care is an important factor driving the human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa.
      We investigate whether nonuse of autodisable syringes and
      other health care indicators predict national HIV
      prevalence.</p>

      <p><b>Methods</b><br />
       These ecologic analyses use countries as study units in
      descriptive analyses and regression analyses. Two sets of
      observations are used: (i) all low- and
      lower-middle&ndash;income countries, and (ii) all sub-Saharan
      African countries with available data.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b><br />
       In the descriptive analysis, health care indicators (health
      expenditures, vaccination coverage, and use of autodisable
      syringes) have a U-shaped relationship with HIV prevalence in
      the larger sample. Greater density of physicians is
      associated with lower HIV prevalence. In sub-Saharan Africa,
      antenatal care coverage is associated with increasing HIV
      prevalence. In regression analyses, nonuse of autodisable
      syringes is associated robustly with greater HIV prevalence
      in all models. For the larger sample, greater HIV prevalence
      also is associated with higher Gini Index, less female
      economic activity, less urbanization, and less percentage of
      Muslims. In sub-Saharan Africa, tetanus vaccination coverage
      has a U-shaped association with HIV prevalence. Low physician
      density and percentage of Muslims are associated with HIV
      prevalence. Other economic and health care indicators and
      epidemic age are not significant correlates of HIV
      prevalence.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusions</b><br />
       <span class="yellow">This analysis adds to the other sources
      of evidence for health care transmission of HIV (in
      sub-Saharan Africa and regions with similar epidemiologic
      characteristics) by showing that health care indicators
      (failure to use autodisable syringes and greater tetanus
      coverage) are associated robustly with greater HIV
      prevalence.</span> We recommend that resources be reallocated
      to address health care transmission of HIV/acquired
      immunodeficiency syndrome.</p>
