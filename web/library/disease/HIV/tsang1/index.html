      <h2>Salivary lysozyme and related parameters of a
      predominantly Chinese, HIV-infected cohort in Hong Kong.</h2>

        <p><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> To evaluate the salivary lysozyme
        concentration, flow rate and pH of a predominantly Chinese,
        HIV-infected group in Hong Kong, and to compare with an
        equal number of age and gender-matched HIV-free
        individuals.</p>

        <p><b>STUDY DESIGN:</b> A prospective longitudinal study
        over a 12-month period of 32 predominantly Chinese, male,
        HIV-infected group in a hospital setting in Hong Kong.
        Whole saliva collection by expectoration, lysozyme
        evaluation by 'lysoplate method'; pH and flow rate
        evaluation using standard methods and correlation with
        other clinical parameters using regression analysis.</p>

        <p><b>RESULTS:</b> The flow rate and the pH of saliva were
        lower compared with HIV-free, healthy individuals (both P
        &lt; 0.0001) and salivary lysozyme concentration of the
        HIV-infected group was 23% higher compared with the
        HIV-free group (P &lt; 0.001), though there was no
        significant difference between the lysozyme output (P &gt;
        0.05) expressed as mug min-1. On multiple regression
        analysis, intravenous drug users had a higher salivary
        lysozyme concentration compared with the homosexual group
        (P = 0.0015) though other variables investigated were not
        significantly related to the salivary lysozyme
        concentrations.</p>

        <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The significant changes in the flow
        rate, pH value and lysozyme concentration of whole saliva
        of the HIV-infected individuals as compared with the
        HIV-free, healthy individuals, may be due to the disease
        itself or a combination of factors including the
        medications used in the disease management.</p>
