      <p><b>Accepted</b> January 2004</p>

      <p><b>Objective</b> To observe recent trends in human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence in antenatal clinic
      attendees to determine if previously noted falls in HIV
      prevalence are occurring on both sides of the Kenyan-Ugandan
      border.</p>

      <p><b>Design</b> An ecologic study was conducted at the
      district level comparing HIV prevalence rates over time using
      data available through reports published by the Kenyan and
      Ugandan Ministries of Health and UNAIDS.</p>

      <p><b>Methods</b> Sentinel sites were compared with respect
      to population, ethnicity, language group, and the prevalence
      of circumcision practice. The prevalence of HIV found at each
      sentinel site was recorded for the years 1990&ndash;2000 and
      analysed visually and by conducting bivariate
      correlations.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b> Ethnographic analysis revealed a wide mix
      of ethnic and language groups and circumcision rates on both
      sides of the border. All sentinel surveillance sites in
      Uganda showed trends towards decreasing HIV prevalence, with
      three of five sites showing statistically significant
      declines (r = 0.87, 0.85, 0.86, <i>P</i> 0.05). In contrast,
      all of the surveillance sites in Kenya showed trends toward
      increasing HIV prevalence, with two of the five sites showing
      statistically significant increases (r = 0.62, 0.84, <i>P</i>
      0.05).</p>

      <p><b>Conclusions</b> The declines in HIV prevalence
      occurring in Uganda are not being seen in geographically
      proximal districts of Kenya. <span class="yellow">No obvious
      differences in ethnic groupings or their associated
      prevalence of circumcision appeared to explain these
      differences.</span> This suggests that decreasing HIV
      prevalence in Uganda is not due to the natural course of the
      epidemic but reflects real success in terms of HIV control
      policies.</p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text1">Despite the generally bleak picture
      presented by the devastating spread of human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV) in Africa over the last decade, there is now
      evidence appearing that in some countries the size of the
      epidemic may be decreasing. Reports from Uganda and Zambia
      have shown declining prevalence rates in sentinel surveys of
      pregnant women since the mid-1990s, especially in younger age
      groups.<sup><a href="#n1">1,2</a></sup> In Uganda these
      decreases have been accompanied by concomitant delays in
      sexual initiation, decreases in casual sex among young
      people, and increased condom use.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> A recent study has now also described
      an observed decrease in HIV incidence in a cohort of nearly
      7000 people in rural southwestern Uganda.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> Questions remain, however, as to what
      is driving these downward trends. It is possible that the
      decrease in Uganda simply shows that the peak (epidemic)
      prevalence of HIV is higher than the endemic prevalence of
      the disease and that this reflects only the maturing of
      epidemic. However, it may also be possible that these
      decreases reflect a real success of HIV control programmes in
      Uganda and that these programmes should be looked at more
      closely to provide lessons for other countries where HIV
      prevalence continues to increase.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      author.</p>

      <p class="text2">Kenya, with whom Uganda shares a border, has
      not seen these sorts of decreases in HIV prevalence.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5,6</a></sup> Estimates for the end of 2001
      suggest that approximately 15% of the general population in
      Kenya is infected with HIV,<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>
      versus only 5% in Uganda,<sup><a href="#n7">7,8</a></sup>
      which is much the reverse of the situation 10 years ago.
      Kenya has several sentinel surveillance sites which are
      situated in the Western highlands, close to Lake Victoria,
      which are in close proximity to the border with Uganda.
      Similarly Uganda has several sites in the eastern part of the
      country which are close to the Kenyan border, which share
      roughly the same geographical location. These sites represent
      a mix of ethnic and language groups on both sides of the
      border, and are located on the major transportation routes
      through the region. If the changes in HIV prevalence which
      are being seen for Uganda as a whole are due to natural
      changes in the course of the epidemic, one would expect to
      see them also occurring to some extent in neighbouring
      districts in Kenya. Therefore, we thought it useful to
      compare trends in HIV prevalence from sites on either side of
      this border, to get an indication if these changes are due to
      epidemiological or political (i.e. health policy) changes
      over the last decade.</p>
      <br />
       

      <h3>Methods</h3>

      <p class="text1"><b>Setting</b><br />
       Kenya and Uganda are countries in East Africa which have
      been known to be affected by generalized epidemics of HIV
      since the mid-1980s. Their common border begins on the shores
      of Lake Victoria and extends approximately 500 km to the
      border of Sudan. Kenya has an estimated population of 31
      million people and Uganda has 24 million people.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5,7</a></sup> Both are categorized as low-income
      countries with GNP per capita figures of between $US 300 and
      400. Both are ethnically diverse countries with more than 40
      distinct ethno-cultural groups living within their
      borders.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Data sources</b><br />
       HIV surveillance data have been available for each country
      since the early 1990s. In the year 2000 Kenya had 2 urban
      sites and 14 rural sites reporting data and Uganda had 13
      rural sites and 2 urban sites. Anonymous, unlinked prevalence
      surveys for HIV conducted once per year with antenatal clinic
      attendees has been recommended by UNAIDS as a relatively
      inexpensive way to acquire good epidemiological data on the
      course of the disease in low-income countries.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> The number of women tested in each
      site varies from year to year. In the year 2000, the Ugandan
      survey results were based on sample sizes of between 250 and
      600 women per site.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> No sample
      size information was available from Kenya.</p>

      <p class="text2">Sentinel surveillance sites in Kenya and
      Uganda from 1990 to 2000 were accessed through the UNAIDS web
      site.<sup><a href="#n5">5,7</a></sup> These data were
      compared with the most recently available national HIV/AIDS
      surveillance reports from each country to ensure accuracy and
      completeness.<sup><a href="#n6">6,8</a></sup> Five sites in
      eastern Uganda were chosen (Tororro, Mbale, Pallisa, Jinja,
      and Soroti) because of their proximity (&lt;150 km) to the
      border with Kenya (Figure 1). All sites are located in the
      Eastern province of Uganda in the highland area, except for
      Jinja, which is located in Busoga province and is a port on
      Lake Victoria. Similarly, five sites within 150 km of the
      border were chosen from Kenya. Busia, Kakamega, and Mbale
      (Vihiga) are located in Western province. Kitale is in Rift
      Valley province and Kisumu is a port on Lake Victoria in
      Nyanza province. For comparative purposes, the median values
      for all rural sites in Kenya and Uganda were also
      analysed.</p>

      <p class="text2">Simple population and ethnographic
      information was compiled for each site to ensure that there
      were no obvious confounding patterns between the Uganda and
      the Kenya group of sites which would lead to differences in
      HIV rates over time. Specifically, data on the district
      population, population of the principal town, major ethnic
      groups or groups and the language family of these groups were
      compiled.<sup><a href="#n10">10&ndash;12</a></sup> As well,
      information from published sources was compiled regarding the
      practice of circumcision in each ethnic group,<sup><a
      href="#n13">13&ndash;17</a></sup> as this has been shown to
      be associated with HIV prevalence in ecological
      studies.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Data analysis</b><br />
       The percentages of all pregnant women who tested positive
      for HIV for each year were entered in Excel 98 (Microsoft
      Corp. Seattle, Washington) and graphed to show trends over
      time. The significance of these observed trend were then
      tested by conducting bivariate correlations to look for
      significant associations between increasing year and HIV
      prevalence for each site using SPSS software (SPSS Base 10.0,
      Chicago, IL) This method was chosen as we did not have sample
      size information which would have allowed us to perform a
      &chi;<sup>2</sup> test of trend.</p>
      <br />
       

      <h3>Results</h3>

      <p class="text1">A summary of the population and ethnographic
      characteristics of the 10 surveillance sites is shown in
      Table 1. The Ugandan sites represented districts which varied
      in size between 434 000 people to just over 1 million. One
      site, Pallisa, did not have a principal town with over 15 000
      people. The largest principal town of the Uganda sites was
      Jinja, the second largest city in Uganda, with just over 87
      000 people. The districts sampled by these sites represent
      12.4% of the Ugandan population. Similarly, the Kenyan
      sentinel sites represented districts of between 346 000 and
      1.2 million people in size. One of the sites, Mbale (Vihiga),
      did not have a principal town larger than 15 000 people and
      the largest municipal population was that of Kisumu, Kenya's
      third largest city with 273 000 people. The districts sampled
      by these sites represent approximately 7.6% of the Kenyan
      population although it is probably more, given that we were
      unable to find reliable figures for the district populations
      of Kisumu or Kitale.</p>

      geographical proximity to each other are experiencing
      significantly different recent trends in HIV prevalence in
      antenatal clinic attendees. These differences do not seem to
      result from clear differences in ethnic or language groupings
      and therefore can likely be assumed to be independent of any
      predominant risk behaviours which could predispose one or
      more groups to HIV infection. The trends also appear to be
      independent of the levels of circumcision in an ethnic group,
      a factor which previously had been used to explain the high
      prevalence of HIV found in East Africa.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> This therefore suggests that the
      decreasing prevalence of HIV seen in Uganda is not occurring
      as a natural course of the epidemic, but rather reflects real
      differences in HIV control policies between Kenya and
      Uganda.</p>

      <p class="text2">Serial surveys of HIV prevalence in
      antenatal clinic attendees are a rather crude, but simple and
      inexpensive way to monitor the course of the epidemic. They
      inherently contain several biases which may change over time.
      Early in an epidemic, they tend to overestimate the
      prevalence of HIV in the population, as pregnant women are
      obviously more sexually active than the general population.
      As the epidemic matures and more women have become infected
      for longer periods of time, they will experience decreasing
      levels of fertility which in turn leads to HIV infected women
      becoming less likely to be selected for participation in
      serial surveys.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> Thus in a
      mature epidemic, antenatal surveys will tend to underestimate
      the extent of the epidemic. Given the close geographical
      proximity of these surveillance sites, however, it seems
      unlikely that these biases would be operating in opposite
      directions in Kenya and Uganda.</p>

      <p class="text2">Another explanation for the decreasing
      prevalence seen in Uganda has been the maturing of the
      epidemic. That is, that the stable, or endemic prevalence is
      expected to be less than the epidemic prevalence of the
      disease. This could be because more people are dying from
      infections they acquired more than 10 years ago in Uganda and
      that people in Kenya have not lived with HIV for long enough
      for them to see this increase in mortality. Again, given the
      close geographical proximity and similarly ethnic
      heterogeneity of these communities, it seems unlikely that
      HIV arrived in these areas at a significantly different times
      in the past. This is especially true given that the
      prevalence of HIV in antenatal populations of these sites was
      essentially the same in Kenya and Uganda in the early
      1990s.</p>

      <p class="text2">These differences in rates could also be due
      to a decrease in the number of available susceptible people
      in the population over time as more of them have become
      infected in Uganda. However, HIV is different from many other
      epidemic diseases in that newly susceptible sub-populations
      emerge on a continual basis as young people become sexually
      active. If the pool of susceptible people is becoming smaller
      in Uganda, this can only be possible if the newly sexually
      active population has changed their behaviour to limit their
      risks for acquiring HIV. Published studies agree that this is
      probably happening in Uganda, and likely reflects some
      success of the Ugandan HIV prevention strategy, and not a
      natural course of the epidemic.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,19</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The lack of an effect
      of circumcision prevalence on HIV prevalence is interesting,
      and runs counter to recent explanations of why HIV prevalence
      is so high in Kisumu.</span><sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup>
      While Kisumu did have the highest prevalence of HIV found in
      any site among the lowest levels of circumcision, other high
      prevalence sites in Kenya, such as Busia have high levels of
      circumcision. <span class="yellow">As well, most of the
      Ugandan sites are home to ethnic groups where circumcision is
      not practised and their HIV prevalence rates have been
      decreasing.</span> These findings do not suggest that
      circumcision does not offer some degree of protection from
      HIV infection, but rather demonstrates that reductions in the
      spread of HIV are possible even in populations with low
      circumcision rates.</p>

      <p class="text2">So, if the size of the HIV epidemic is
      decreasing in Uganda, but not in Kenya, and it appears due to
      differences in policy, what types of policies may be
      responsible? Currently, both countries have national AIDS
      control commissions, which set policy for their respective
      HIV/AIDS programmes. However, the Ugandan AIDS Commission was
      established in 1986 within the office of the President,
      whereas it took until 1999 for a similar high-level body, the
      National AIDS Control Council to be established in
      Kenya.<sup><a href="#n6">6,20</a></sup> Thus, from the
      beginning of the epidemic there was a higher level of senior
      government commitment to combating HIV in Uganda. Through a
      combination of government and non-governmental organizations,
      Uganda has been more successful in developing preventive
      healthcare services for HIV, primarily voluntary counselling
      and testing (VCT), as well as services to provide care and
      support for those who test positive.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> The first AIDS Information Centre
      (AIC) opened in Kampala in 1990 in order to provide better
      access to VCT services. By 1993, AIC branches had been set up
      in three other centres, including two of the sites included
      in this study, Jinja and Mbale. As of 1999 AIC had provided
      counselling and testing to nearly 400 000 clients in Uganda
      through four independent sites and over 35 satellite sites in
      hospitals and health centres.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21,22</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In contrast, VCT for HIV in government
      health facilities in Kenya has only been widely promoted
      since 2001, beginning with the publication of national VCT
      guidelines. One of the largest VCT development programmes in
      Kenya, run by the US Centers for Disease Control, had
      provided VCT services to nearly 13 000 clients by the end of
      2001.<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> National figures for
      VCT services are not available, but access is generally
      considered to be poor.<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">VCT services in Uganda have also been
      supported by the efforts of The AIDS Support Organization
      (TASO), a non-governmental organization which has been
      providing social and psychological support and medical care
      to over 59 000 HIV positive clients since 1987 in Uganda.
      Jinja, Mbale, and Tororro all have TASO branches,<sup><a
      href="#n21">21,25</a></sup> whereas no such supportive
      organization exists in Kenya on such a scale.</p>

      <p class="text2">As well, two large cohort studies have been
      operating in the south-west part of Uganda since the early
      1990s, which may have raised the profile of HIV/AIDS in
      Uganda.<sup><a href="#n3">3,15</a></sup> In the study which
      showed declining incidence of HIV, the authors raised the
      possibility that the very existence of this project may have
      had an effect on reducing risk behaviour in their
      cohort.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> It is possible that
      this effect has been seen even in districts outside of the
      study area. Finally, the death of a prominent musician,
      Philly Lutaaya, who publicly announced he was suffering from
      HIV in 1988, probably has helped to raise awareness and
      decrease the stigma associated with HIV in Uganda.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21,26</a></sup> The Philly Lutaaya
      Initiative/People with HIV/AIDS Initiative was founded in his
      memory shortly after his death in order to help HIV positive
      people tell others about their condition.<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup> All of these initiatives likely have
      made the general population of Uganda more aware of the
      spread of HIV in their community and perhaps more responsive
      to risk reduction messages.</p>

      <p class="text2">Both countries have developed public
      education programmes,<sup><a href="#n6">6,19</a></sup> but
      &lsquo;quiet &lsquo; promotion and distribution of condoms,
      and school- and village-based health education programmes are
      thought to be widely available in Uganda,<sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> while their availability in Kenya is
      not known. Of note, in 1997, President Moi of Kenya stopped
      the planned implementation of a sex education programme in
      schools in response to pressure from religious
      leaders.<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup> No improvements in
      treatment services for sexually transmitted infections have
      been noted over the last 10 years in Uganda<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> but have been reported for in two
      cities in Kenya, not included in this study.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Whether a cause or an effect of these
      successes, Uganda has been more successful in securing
      funding for its efforts, as it had an estimated budget of $US
      4.8 million for HIV/AIDS in 2001, versus $US 1.8 million in
      Kenya.<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">This study has several limitations. Firstly,
      it assumes that serial surveys conducted in Kenya and Uganda
      followed the same methodologies and were free from systematic
      biases. However, we have no details about the data collection
      from each of these sites, except that these countries have
      agreed to participate in surveillance systems recommended by
      UNAIDS. The number of pregnant women surveyed for each year
      was not available, for either country. It is possible that
      smaller numbers being surveyed in Kenya could lead to less
      reliable results. It is likely that the number of women
      tested was set to provide reliable data for national or
      perhaps, regional surveillance, and may not be appropriate
      for a district-level analysis. However, it is unlikely that
      any differential biases would be observed so consistently
      over time.</p>

      <p class="text2">Secondly, if there were reasons why HIV
      positive women would be deferred from attending antenatal
      clinics in Uganda or encouraged to attend antenatal clinics
      in Kenya, a systematic biasing of the data could result. For
      example, if prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTC)
      programmes were more widely available in Kenya than in
      Uganda, more women would probably opt for antenatal care in
      Kenya. However, there is no evidence that either of these
      possibilities have arisen. PMTC programmes have only become
      feasible on a large scale since the publication of the HIV
      NET 012 trial in 1999<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> and
      remain to be widely implemented in both countries.</p>

      <p class="text2">Thirdly, it is still possible that
      significant differences exist in risk behaviours or other
      factors that protect against HIV transmission in the
      districts sampled in Uganda versus those in Kenya. These
      factors would need to have been in place before any
      government-sponsored interventions could begin to operate,
      and could have imposed a limit to the potential extent of the
      epidemic in these areas. Lower levels of multiple sexual
      partners, or polygyny could be such a factor. A lower
      prevalence of herpes simplex virus, type 2 (HSV-2) in the
      Ugandan population compared with Kenya could be another. The
      only published prevalence studies for HSV-2 in Kenya and
      Uganda found similarly high rates of infection in both
      countries, although the studies were conducted 8 years apart
      and may not be directly comparable.<sup><a
      href="#n31">30,31</a></sup> Trend data for HSV-2 infections
      are not available for either country.</p>

      <p class="text2">Finally, this study assumes that the sexual
      behaviours and cultural practices are more similar within
      individual ethnic groups than that between different groups
      living in the same country. Further it assumes that
      populations living in each surveillance site reflect the
      behaviour and practices of the local dominant ethnic group.
      These generalizations ignore the mix of ethnic groups that
      live in each of the districts sampled, but seem reasonable in
      the absence of district-level information about these
      factors.</p>

      <p class="text2">In summary, the Ugandan approach to dealing
      with HIV has involved many different players: community
      groups, non-governmental organizations, research groups, as
      well as government. While Kenya has also tried to develop a
      similar broad-based approach to HIV prevention and care, it
      appears to have started much later and has been less
      successful in disseminating its programmes and messages
      widely. While further research will help to define the
      differences in HIV services, programming, and risk behaviours
      between Kenya and Uganda, it seems unlikely that any single
      policy decision or programme will be able to explain the
      differences in HIV prevalence trends which we have observed.
      However, further research may be able to determine which
      aspects of the Ugandan approach have been most closely linked
      with falling HIV prevalence and incidence, and which aspects
      could be used as models for other countries in sub-Saharan
      Africa.</p>
