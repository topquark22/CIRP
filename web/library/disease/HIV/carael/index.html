      <p>Abstract:</p>

      <p>From February to June 1986, 150 heterosexual couples with
      at least one HIV-seropositive member were recruited in the
      'Centre Hospitalier de Kigali', Kigali, Rwanda. Of the 138
      HIV-seropositive couples in whom both members were tested,
      124 (90%) were sexual unions between two antibody-positive
      partners, illustrating the high efficiency of the
      heterosexual transmission of HIV. A comparison of these 124
      couples with 150 HIV-seronegative couples showed that, in the
      husbands, seropositivity is significantly associated with
      sexual contacts with prostitutes and history of sexually
      transmitted disease (STD) within the past 2 years.
      Seropositive wives were less likely to be in their first
      marriage and reported more episodes of STD than seronegative
      ones. Seropositive couples were similar to seronegatives in
      their history of blood transfusion, <span class="yellow">male
      circumcision</span> and overall use of contraception but not
      in their use of oral contraceptive pills, which was more
      frequent; they were more often in polygamous unions.
      Discriminant analysis showed that STD, sexual contacts with
      prostitutes and the number of previous unions are the most
      powerful independent variables associated with the
      seropositivity of the couples. Most of the risk factors for
      the couples were the risk factors for the husband, suggesting
      that in most cases the husband acquired the HIV infection and
      passed it to his wife.</p>
