      <h2>Association between HIV-2 infection and genital ulcer
      diseases<br />
       among male sexually transmitted disease patients in The
      Gambia.</h2>

      <h4>P&eacute;pin, J., Quigley, M., Todd, J., Gaye, I.,
      Janneh, M., Van Dyck, E., Piot, P., and Whittle, H.</h4>

      <p>Abstract:<br />
       <a href="http://www.mrc.gm/" target="_blank">Medical
      Research Council Laboratories</a>,<br />
       Fajara,<br />
       The Gambia.</p>

      <p><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> To investigate whether genital ulcer
      diseases are cofactors which enhance the transmission of
      HIV-2 in West Africa.</p>

      <p><b>DESIGN:</b> A cross-sectional study of 435 men
      presenting with a sexually transmitted disease (STD).</p>

      <p><b>SETTING:</b> The outpatient clinic of the Medical
      Research Council Laboratories, a primary care facility in
      Fajara, a suburb of Banjul, the capital city of The Gambia
      (West Africa).</p>

      <p><b>PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS:</b> Six hundred and twenty-four
      men presenting with a genital complaint, of whom 443 had an
      STD. Eight of the men with an STD were excluded from further
      analysis because they were HIV-1-infected (five patients) or
      had indeterminate Western blot patterns (three patients). The
      remaining 21 HIV-2-infected and 414 seronegative men
      constituted our study-group.</p>

      <p><b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:</b> Participants were questioned
      about previous STD and behavioural and demographic
      characteristics. A physical examination was performed and
      serum collected for measurement of antibodies against
      Haemophilus ducreyi and Treponema pallidum.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> HIV-2-infected men were more likely than
      HIV-seronegative participants to have previously had a
      genital ulcer [odds ratio (OR), 3.00; 95% confidence interval
      (Cl), 1.18-7.60] and to have antibodies against T. pallidum
      (OR, 5.95; 95% Cl, 2.10-16.91), or H. ducreyi (OR, 4.59; 95%
      Cl, 1.71-12.33). Circumcised patients with residual foreskin
      were more likely to be HIV-2 infected than patients with
      complete circumcision. HIV-2-seropositive patients were six
      times more likely to have generalized lymphadenopathy than
      their seronegative counterparts.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> <span class="yellow">Our data suggest
      that genital ulcerative diseases, such as syphilis and
      chancroid, are probably cofactors that increase the
      transmission of HIV-2 in West Africa, and that HIV-2
      infection frequently results in generalized
      lymphadenopathy.</span></p>
