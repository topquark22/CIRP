      <h2>Rolling out male circumcision as a mass HIV/AIDS
      intervention seems neither justified nor practicable</h2>

      <p class="text1">Two articles<sup><a href="#n1">1,2</a></sup>
      published in this issue address male circumcision (MC).</p>

      <p class="text2">Connolly <i>et al.</i><sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> show in a national survey that MC,
      whether pre-pubertal or post-pubertal, has no protective
      effect on acquisition by males of HIV infection as measured
      by prevalence.</p>

      <p class="text2">Sidler <i>et al.</i><sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> state that neonatal MC continues to be
      promoted without adequate justification as a medicalised
      ritual, via an HIV prevention rationale. They caution that
      for MC to be a therapeutic as opposed to a non-therapeutic
      procedure, it is necessary to gather more corroborative and
      consistent evidence of its benefit, consider the potential
      harms (psychological, sexual, surgical and
      behavioural/disinhibition), examine the ethical implications,
      and examine effectiveness and efficiency (costs and benefits)
      at the population and societal levels. They point out that MC
      is not just a technical surgical intervention &ndash; it
      takes place in a social context that can radically alter the
      anticipated outcome. At the 2008 International AIDS
      Conference<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> in Mexico cultural,
      political and educational issues raised by the intervention,
      such as decreased condom use and marginalisation of women,
      were hotly debated. Some cultural interpretations may view MC
      as a licence to have unprotected sex. A case in point is
      Swaziland, where men are flocking to be circumcised with the
      understanding that this means they no longer need to use
      other preventive methods (e.g. wear condoms or limit the
      number of sexual partners).<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The 2003 Cochrane review<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> of observational studies of MC
      effectiveness concluded that there was insufficient evidence
      to support it as an anti-HIV intervention. Three randomised
      controlled trials (RCTs) from South Africa, Kenya and Uganda
      in 2006 - 2007 show a protective effect of MC. However,
      Garenne<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> has subsequently shown
      from observational data that there is considerable
      heterogeneity of the effect of MC across 14 African
      countries. Despite the South African RCT showing a protective
      effect, he reports for the nine South African provinces that
      &lsquo;there is no evidence that HIV transmission over the
      period 1994 - 2004 was slower in those provinces with higher
      levels of circumcision&rsquo;. Interestingly, in both Kenya
      and Uganda, where two of the RCTs were done, a protective
      effect of MC was observed, but a harmful effect was observed
      in Cameroon, Lesotho and Malawi. The other eight countries
      showed no significant effect of MC.</p>

      <p class="text2">These somewhat discordant findings are
      difficult to interpret. While RCTs are theoretically strong
      designs, it is conceivable that their findings are not
      generalisable beyond their settings. Furthermore, there have
      been no trials of neonatal MC. Study flaws such as inability
      to obtain double blinding, and loss to follow-up in RCTs, may
      effectively degrade their quality to that of observational
      studies. Meanwhile other disturbing findings referred to by
      Sidler <i>et al.</i> are emerging, including the reported
      higher risk for women partners of circumcised HIV positive
      men, disinhibition, urological complications, relatively
      small effect sizes of MC at the population level, and
      relative cost-inefficiency of MC.</p>

      <p class="text2">Not all objections to MC as an HIV
      intervention have to do with evidence of effectiveness or
      cost. Sidler <i>et al.</i> raise ethical objections. Owing to
      the current climate of desperation with regard to the HIV
      epidemic, evidence in favour of MC frequently seems
      overstated. This reduces the scope for informed consent and
      autonomy for adult men considering the procedure. Further
      problems arise in the case of neonates whose parents may be
      considering the procedure. Whereas informed consent is at
      least possible for adult men, it is clearly not possible for
      neonates. Parents can only guess what the child&rsquo;s
      wishes would be if he were presented with the information
      they have at their disposal. If it could be shown that
      circumcision was necessary in the neonatal period, parental
      consent on behalf of the neonate would be justified. But
      since no valid surgical indications for circumcision exist in
      this period, and the future benefit to the child in respect
      of HIV avoidance is not relevant before sexual debut, the
      duty of parents may well be to err on the side of caution,
      and defer the procedure until the child can make an
      autonomous decision. In the absence of compelling
      indications, a procedure such as circumcision could also be
      seen as a violation of the child&rsquo;s right to bodily
      integrity. Furthermore, the ethical principle of
      non-maleficence cannot be upheld as there are clear harms
      attached to this practice, to which Sidler <i>et al.</i>
      refer in their article. Lastly, at a societal level MC may be
      unjust insofar as it could compete for resources with more
      effective and less costly interventions<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> and disadvantage women.</p>

      <p class="text2">Despite a strong pro-circumcision lobby
      driven by enthusiasts who have been promoting MC as an (HIV)
      intervention for many years, and impatience expressed by
      protagonists about the long delay after the 2006 - 2007 RCT
      results and the UNAIDS/WHO policy recommendations<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> of March 2007, few mass campaigns have
      been launched in African countries.</p>

      <p class="text2">Given the epidemiological uncertainties and
      the economic, cultural, ethical and logistical barriers, it
      seems neither justified nor practicable to roll out MC as a
      mass anti-HIV/AIDS intervention.</p>
