      <h2>HIV and circumcision in South Africa</h2>

      <p><b>C.A. Connolly<sup>1</sup>, O. Shisana, L. Simbayi, M.
      Colvin.</b></p>

      <p><sup>1</sup>Medical Research Council, Durban, South
      Africa; <sup>2</sup>Human Sciences Research Council, Cape
      Town, South Africa</p>

      <p><b>Background:</b> HIV infection remains highly prevalent
      in South Africa. Male circumcision has been shown to be
      protective for the acquisition of HIV in other African
      countries. It is important to determine if this association
      is evident in South Africa.</p>

      <p><b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional, national
      household-based survey was conducted using second-generation
      surveillance procedures, weighted data adjusted for sample
      design was used. A total of 2585 males over the age of 15
      were administered questionnaires and provided specimens for
      HIV testing.</p>

      <p><b>Results:</b> Circumcision was reported by 916 (35.4%)
      of male participants. HIV prevalence among circumcised males
      was 10.7% and among uncircumcised males was 12.1%, p = 0.9.
      Blacks were less likely to be circumcised (28.8%) compared to
      other racial groups, 42.6%, p = 0.002. <span
      class="yellow">When the data was stratified by racial group,
      circumcised Blacks showed similar rates of HIV as
      uncircumcised Blacks, (OR: 0.8, p = 0.4).</span> however
      other racial groups showed a strong protective effect, (OR:
      0.3, p = 0.01). The age of circumcision differed by racial
      group. Among Blacks, 37% were circumcised above the age of 12
      compared to 6% among other racial groups. When the data are
      further stratified by age of circumcision, there is a slight
      protective effect between early circumcision and HIV among
      Blacks, OR: 0.7, p = 0.4.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusion:</b> <span class="yellow">In general,
      circumcision offers slight protection.</span> The effect is
      much stronger in other racial groups than in blacks. This
      racial difference cannot be explained by age of
      circumcision.</p>
