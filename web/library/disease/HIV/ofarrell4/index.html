      <p>It remains unclear why there is such marked variation in
      the severity of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      epidemic between African countries. The prevalence of HIV
      infection has reached high levels in many parts of southern
      Africa but in most countries of West Africa the levels are
      much lower. Although there is good evidence that sexually
      transmitted infections (STIs) and genital ulcers in
      particular facilitate heterosexual transmission of HIV, there
      is little comparative STI data from the African countries
      worst affected by HIV infection. A MEDLINE search covering
      the period 1966 to August 2000 using the keywords "sexually
      transmitted diseases", "genital ulcers" and "Africa" was
      performed to identify factors that might be relevant to the
      spread of HIV infection in countries with the highest
      prevalences of the virus. In the countries worst affected by
      HIV infection, the proportions of men and women with STI who
      had genital ulcers lay in the ranges 45-68% and 13-68%,
      respectively. The proportions were much lower in countries of
      West Africa than in those of southern Africa. The African
      countries worst affected by HIV infection should adopt a more
      specialized approach to STI control than hitherto and
      specifically target the high incidence of genital ulceration.
      Locally, technical STI committees should draw up
      country-specific guidelines taking into account the
      prevalence of the various causes of genital ulceration. In
      these countries, national AIDS control programmes and donor
      agencies should develop a specific focus for decreasing the
      incidence of genital ulcer disease.</p>
