      <blockquote>
        <p class="text1">Differences between the epidemiology of
        AIDS cases in Africa and that in Western societies have
        prompted speculation regarding risk factors that may be
        unique to Africa. Because of the age and sex distribution
        of AIDS cases in Africa, emphasis has been placed on sexual
        transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Factors
        thought to influence this sexual transmission include
        (<i>1</i>) promiscuity, with a high prevalence of sexually
        transmitted disease; (<i>2</i>) sexual practices that have
        been associated with increased risk of transmission of AIDS
        virus (homosexuality and anal intercourse); and (<i>3</i>)
        cultural practices that are possibly connected with
        increased virus transmission (female "circumcision" and
        infibulation). Other nonsexual cultural practices that do
        not fit the age distribution pattern of AIDS but may expose
        individuals to HIV include (<i>1</i>) practices resulting
        in exposure to blood (medicinal bloodletting, rituals
        establishing "blood brotherhood," and possibly ritual and
        medicinal enemas); (<i>2</i>) practices involving the use
        of shared instruments (injection of medicines, ritual
        scarification, group circumcision, genital tatooing, and
        shaving of body hair); and (<i>3</i>) contact with nonhuman
        primates. At the current time promiscuity seems to be the
        most important cultural factor contributing to the
        transmission of HIV in Africa.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">The recent spread of AIDS throughout Africa
      raises the question of whether the mode of transmission of
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Africa is different
      from that in the United States and other Western countries.
      Although there is widespread seropositivity to HIV in Central
      and East Africa [<a href="#n1">1,2</a>] and to the related T
      cell-lymphyocytic virus Type III (STLV-III<sub>AGM</sub>) in
      West Africa [<a href="#n3">3</a>], the absence of risk
      factors of intravenous drug abuse and homosexuality points to
      patterns of transmission that are different from those in
      Western society. The difference is especially apparent
      because the male-to-female ratio of affected individuals is
      ~1:1 in Africa vs. 19:1 in the United States and Europe [<a
      href="#n4">4</a>]. This report briefly examines cultural
      practices that may contribute to the spread of AIDS in Africa
      and highlights areas that require further research.</p>

      <p class="text2">Any hypothesis that attempts to account for
      the equal sex distribution of AIDS cases in Africa must take
      into account the apparent age distribution of the disease.
      Cases are found in infants (who presumably acquire the
      disease from their mothers) and in sexually active adults.
      Although data for young children are still incomplete, AIDS
      cases have been reported only infrequently among those age
      groups, except in cases of blood transfusions. (Earlier
      reports of HIV seropositivity in children [<a
      href="#n5">5</a>] may have been the result of nonspecific
      reactions [<a href="#n6">6</a>].) Hence emphasis has been
      placed on sexual transmission of HIV. Factors thought to
      influence sexual transmission in Africa include (<i>1</i>)
      sexual promiscuity, with a high prevalence of sexually
      transmitted disease (STD); (<i>2</i>) sexual practices that
      have been associated with a high degree of transmission of
      HIV (homosexuality and anal intercourse); and (<i>3</i>)
      cultural practices that are possibly connected with increased
      virus transmission (female "circumcision" and infibulation).
      Other nonsexual cultural practices that do not fit the age
      distribution of AIDS but may expose individuals to HIV
      include (<i>1</i>) practices resulting in exposure to blood
      (medicinal bloodletting, rituals establishing "blood
      brotherhood," and possibly ritual and medicinal enemas);
      (<i>2</i>) practices involving the use of shared instruments
      (injection of medicines, ritual scarification, group
      circumcision, genital tattooing, and shaving of body hair);
      and contact with nonhuman primates.</p>

      <h3>Female circumcision and Infibulation</h3>

      <p class="text1">It seems to be relatively difficult to pass
      HIV during normal vaginal intercourse. Only 10% of habitual
      heterosexual contacts of hemophiliacs with AIDS become
      seropositive [<a href="#n7">7</a>]. Thus, it has been
      proposed that heterosexual transmission is somehow enhanced
      in Africa. Of course, even with a low rate of
      transmissibility, large numbers of sexual contacts will place
      a promiscuous individual at high risk for acquiring the
      infection. Enhanced heterosexual transmissibility may not
      required for explanation of the equal sex ration among AIDS
      cases in Africa if it is assumed that the virus originated
      and was spread in the promiscuous heterosexual population.
      The same type of "epidemiologic accident" may account for HIV
      transmission in the promiscuous homosexual and drug addict
      populations in the West. However, it has been proposed that
      heterosexual transmission is, in fact, enhanced in Africa
      because of the widespread practice of female circumcision [<a
      href="#n8">8,9</a>].</p>

      <center>
        <img src="Fig1.gif" alt="Map of female excision areas" /> 

        <p><b>Figure 1.</b> Distribution of female excision
        (hatched area) and infibulation (cross hatched area) in
        Africa (see [<a href="#n1">1</a>] [<a
        href="#n4">4</a>]).</p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Female circumcision is a euphemism for
      female genital mutilation. Although it is usually performed
      at or shortly before puberty in Africa, female circumcision
      has little relation to the practice of male circumcision and
      is not usually an initiation rite per se. Three types of
      female circumcision occur in Africa. The most extreme, termed
      infibulation or <i>pharaonic circumcision</i>, involves
      partial closure of the vaginal orifice after excision of
      varying amount of tissue from the vulva, In its extreme form,
      all of the mons veneris, labia majora and minora, and
      clitoris are removed and the involved areas closed by means
      of sutures or thorns. After the operation the thighs are
      strapped together for 4&mdash;8 weeks, with complete
      occlusion of the introitus being prevented by the insertion
      of a matchstick or other wooden object. A more moderate form
      of female circumcision is <i>excision</i>, which involves
      removal of the clitorus and part of the labia minora. The
      mildest form, <i>Sunna circumcision</i> is circumferential
      excision of the clitoral prepuce [<a href="#n10">10</a>].
      Another practice that involves female genital mutilation is
      making "gishiri cuts," which are incisions on the vaginal
      wall and presumably serve the same purpose as female
      circumcision [<a href="#n11">11</a>]. In may cases of
      infibulation and occasional cases of excision, the vaginal
      opening must be cut open by the husband (defibulation) in
      order for childbirth (or in severe cases, sexual relations)
      to occur. After childbirth the woman is often sewn up
      again.</p>

      <p class="text2">In premodern times there were various
      "ritual" explanations for the practice of female
      circumcision. However, the practice continues in modern
      Christian and Muslim Africa. When it can be afforded,
      infibulation now is often performed in hospitals (primarily
      in northwestern Africa [<a href="#n12">12</a>]), so a
      "ritual" or "traditional" explanation for the practice seems
      less likely. One recent theory proposes that the practice is
      an effort by males (and lineages) to curtail female sexual
      pleasure and hence illicit sexual liasons, thereby increasing
      certainty regarding paternity [<a href="#n13">13</a>]. In
      rural tribes where female circumcision occurs, it is nearly
      universal in the female population; however, its prevalence
      is decreasing in urban areas [<a href="#n11">11</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Female circumcision has been postulated to
      increase the likelihood of AIDS transmission via increased
      exposure to blood in the vaginal canal [<a href="#n8">8</a>].
      The presumed explanation is that the small introitus, the
      presence of scar tissue (which may cause tissue friability),
      and the abnormal anatomy of a mutilated vagina would
      predispose to numerous small (or large) tears in the mucosa
      during intercourse. These tears would tend to make the
      squamous vaginal epithelium similar in permeability to the
      columnar mucosa of the rectum, with increased absorption of
      secretions (and virus). A less likely explanation involves
      sexual intercourse shortly at or shortly after the time of
      female circumcision, when open wounds are present.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="Fig2.gif"
        alt="Map of high HIV seropositity areas" />

        high level of seropositivity for human immunodeficiency
        virus.</p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">There are several reasons why female
      circumcision may not be an adequate explanation for enhanced
      heterosexual AIDS transmission. Although the presence of
      lesion in the vagina may increase male-to-female
      transmission, it is unclear how female-to-male transmission
      would be enhanced in this situation. A possible cofactor is
      untreated STD, which could result in the breakdown of the
      mucosal integrity of the male sex organs. [<a
      href="#n4">4</a>]</p>

      <p class="text2">Another major problem is the lack of
      correspondence of the distribution of AIDS and that of female
      circumcision (figure 1). Infibulation occurs mainly in the
      Arabian peninsula, isolated areas of West Africa, the Horn of
      Africa, the Sudan and northen Kenya&mdash;areas that are not
      known at present as "AIDS areas." Thus, infibulation is not
      correlated with AIDS transmission. Excision is performed in
      sub-Saharan Africa (both in West Africa and in East Africa)
      but not in most areas of Central Africa. The only area in
      Zaire that is affected is in the north.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although data are sketchy [<a
      href="#n10">10</a>, <a href="#n11">11</a>, <a
      href="#n14">14</a>], female circumcision is not practiced in
      areas with the highest level of HIV seropositivity. From
      evidence presently available, these areas of high
      seropositivity are eastern Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi, western
      Uganda, northwestern Tanzania, and northern Zambia [<a
      href="#n1">1</a>, <a href="#n3">3</a>, <a href="#n5">5</a>,
      <a href="#n15">15-32</a>] (figure 2). There is some overlap
      of areas in which excision is performed and areas with a
      lower degree of seropositivity, including parts of Zaire,
      Kenya, Central African Republic, and Tanzania. Likewise,
      areas of STLV-III<sub>AGM</sub> seropositivity overlap with
      areas where excision is performed in West Africa. However, if
      female circumcision is an important determinant of AIDS
      transmission, it is difficult to understand why parts of
      Central Africa where levels of AIDS are highest and where
      AIDS was first described do not practice female
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">It must be stressed that data are incomplete
      for these areas. Traditional anthropologists tend to pursue
      details of sexual practices in their studies, and various
      political upheavals have made work in the regions involved
      difficult in recent times. There is also a definite problem
      in data collection by foreigners (especially male foreigners)
      on this topic.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is possible that population movements
      have introduced the practice of female circumcision into
      urban areas where it was previously not found. In fact, it is
      not clear that increasing westernization and urbanization
      have reduced the practice of female circumcision. For
      example, except for the Luo, the practice is still widespread
      in urban areas of Kenya. This pattern may begin to change now
      that President Arap Moi has spoken against the practice; in
      contrast former President Jomo Kenyatta felt that excision
      was a traditional part of Kikuyu life [<a
      href="#n33">33</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Questions relating to female circumcision
      that require further research include the following:
      (<i>1</i>) Is there a correlation of female AIDS cases with
      circumcision? (<i>2</i>) Is viral antigen present more often
      and at higher levels in vaginal secretions of circumcised
      than noncircumcised women? (<i>3</i>) Is the degree of
      trauma, bleeding, and mucosal tearing associated with
      intercourse greater in women who are circumcised than in
      those who are not? (<i>4</i>) What is the degree of female
      circumcision in Central Africa? (<i>5</i>) Does the
      distribution of population groups (i.e., tribes) that have
      high rates of seropositivity correlate with the distribution
      of population groups that practice female circumcision?
      Needless to say, the study of many of those issues would be
      extremely difficult from both technical and political
      standpoints.</p>

      <h3>Promiscuity</h3>

      <p class="text1">Promiscuity, especially the total number of
      sexual partners, is correlated with AIDS in both the United
      States and Africa [<a href="#n34">34,35</a>]. Although
      generalizations are difficult, most traditional African
      societies are promiscuous by Western standards. Promiscuity
      occurs both premaritally and postmaritally. For instance in
      the Lese of Zaire, there is a period following puberty and
      before marriage when sexual relations between young men and a
      number of eligible women are virtually sanctioned by society.
      The father of a woman may judge the suitability of the man on
      the basis of the perceived willingness to invest in his
      daughter [<a href="#n36">36</a>]. In the so-called
      "matrilineal belt" centered in south-central Africa, there is
      an especially high degree of adolescent promiscuity and
      uncertainty about paternity. This situation has probably
      contributed to the prominent family role of the mother's
      brother. For example family wealth is inherited by offspringe
      of the maternal uncle rather than by patrilineal descendents
      from the husband. That is, wealth is passed on to a known
      biologic relative, rather than to the offspring of a wife who
      may or may not be biologic kin. Matrilineal inheritance thus
      may reduce societal pressure to prevent promiscuity;
      matrilineal societies are often promiscuous societies [<a
      href="#n37">37</a>]. However, promiscuity is correlated not
      only with matrilineal societies. Many patrilineal African
      societies are promiscuous as well.</p>

      <p class="text2">There is a high prevalence of female
      sterility (30%-50%) in may areas of sub-Saharan Africa,
      especially in central Africa [<a href="#n">38</a>]. The
      distribution of infertility is patchy in affected areas.
      Regions of low fertility border on areas of high fertility.
      For example in two neighboring districts in the Sudan, the
      local infertility rates vary from 3.2% to 42.5% [<a
      href="#n38">38</a>]. This primary sterility is thought to be
      due to high levels of STDs that result in pelvic inflammatory
      disease in young women [<a href="#n39">39</a>]; transmission
      of STDs is presumably enhanced by promiscuity. It is of
      interest that the "infertility belt" is in areas with a high
      prevalence of antibody to AIDS virus, which also may be
      related to promiscuity.</p>

      <p class="text2">As people leave rural villages and migrate
      to urban areas, the general level of promiscuity usually
      increases. This increase may be attributable in part to the
      relaxation of traditional village values but appears to be
      due primarily to the destitution of poor migrant women, who
      may become prostitutes, and to the greater mobility and
      rootlessness of young male migrants and soldiers. Unlike some
      Asian societies, traditional African societies have no
      apparent pattern of ritual prostitution, and it is unlikely
      that women who become prostitutes for purely monetary reasons
      would be tolerated in traditional surroundings. Increased
      prosmiscuity is especially common among upper- and
      middle-class urban men, who can afford the services of
      prostitutes.</p>

      <p class="text2">As has been noted previously, levels of STDs
      are generally high in Africa [<a href="#n4">4</a>]; this fact
      may reflect both casual attitudes toward sex and high levels
      of promiscuity as well as the lack of easily available
      treatment. Prostitutes are important in the transmission of
      STDs in Africa [<a href="#n40">40</a>] and may be important
      in the transmission of AIDS both in the West and in Africa
      [<a href="#n41">41</a>]. Schuster [<a href="#n42">42</a>]
      provides an in-depth treatment of the lives of Zambian career
      women who preceive themselves as better off trading sex for
      favors and expensive gifts than marrying; contemporary urban
      life provides wives with little of the traditional support
      systems of the village, and the lives of married women are
      isolated, bleak, and improvished [<a href="#n">41</a>] It is
      perhaps significant that the first cases of AIDS in Central
      Africa were reported by in upper class Zaireans seeking
      medical treatment in Europe [<a href="#n14">14</a>]. Except
      for a few rural areas (e.g., Ruwanda and western Uganda),
      AIDS in Africa may be commoner in urban centers [<a
      href="#n1">1</a>, <a href="#n43">43</a>], and the mass of
      increased promiscuity in urban areas is in accord with this
      possible trend. However, not enough data are available on
      either the presence of AIDS in rural areas or sexual patterns
      of urban and rural areas for the establishment of definite
      correlations.</p>

      <p class="text2">Population movements in Africa contribute to
      the "sexual mixing" of various African groups and may be
      related to the spread of AIDS. The entire Central African
      area (and indeed the whole of sub-Saharan Africa) is
      experiencing large shifts in population. Some patterns have
      existed for long periods, such as the movement of Arabic and
      Nilotic peoples into the northern part of Central Africa [<a
      href="#n44">44</a>]. The long-term movement of rural
      population into urban areas is also continuing. Other more
      recent trends include the movement of migrant workers from
      Zaire and Rwanda to neighboring countries (e.g., to the
      copper belt in Zambia), the movement of armies on the
      Uganda-Tanzania border, and the presence of large numbers of
      refugees, especially from Uganda. It is probably significant
      that AIDS cases seem to have been present in Africa only
      since the 1970s [<a href="#n15">15</a>, <a
      href="#n45">45</a>, <a href="#n46">46</a>]--a time frame that
      correlates with the intensification of urbanization and
      population shifts.</p>

      <p class="text2">The relative efficiencies of HIV
      transmission from male to female and from female to male are
      still unclear. If these efficiencies are equal and
      prostitutes represented the major reservoir of HIV infection,
      a higher male-to-female ratio of cases would be expected
      since each prostitute has many sexual contacts. However, it
      is unlikely that female promiscuity is confined to
      "professional" prostitutes, especially in urban areas [<a
      href="#n42">42</a>]. It is also possible that the
      male-to-female transmissibility of HIV is higher than
      female-to-male transmissibility, presumably because of the
      higher concentration of HIV in semen than in cervical
      secretions [<a href="#n47">47</a>]. Both of these factors
      would tend to produce a more equal sex ratio among cases of
      HIV infection.</p>

      <p class="text2">Data from a high-infertility area of Uganda
      indicate that the rate of carriage of gonorrhea is 8.9% among
      men and 18.3% among women. (These values are in contrast to
      the corresponding carriage rates of 4.2% and 2.4% found in a
      low-infertility area [<a href="#n48">48</a>].) Hence
      gonorrhea rates in this high-infertility region tend to be at
      least as high in women as in men. Of course, data on
      gonorrhea and other STDs are not strictly relevant to HIV
      infection since classical STDs can be successfully treated
      and are more often asymptomatic in women than in men.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although the link between the risk of
      acquiring AIDS and promiscuity seems to be clear at this
      time, there are some unanswered questions: (<i>1</i>) How
      does viral transfer occur from male to female and from female
      to male? (<i>2</i>) Is there a close correlation between AIDS
      and sexual promiscuity in rural areas as well as in urban
      areas, or is the distribution of AIDS in rural Africa due to
      some other factor--e.g., transmission from a nonhuman species
      or via a nonsexual cultural practice? (<i>3</i>) Are the few
      cases of AIDS reported in prepubertal children (e.g., cases
      of "slim disease" in patients aged 9, 11, and 13 years [<a
      href="#n17">17</a>] related to sexual activity? (<i>4</i>)
      Does the spread of HIV seropositivity in Africa track
      movments of migrant laborers, armies, and prostitutes out of
      Central Africa?</p>

      <h3>Homosexuality and Anal Intercourse</h3>

      <p class="text1">Homosexuality is not a part of traditional
      societies in Sub-Saharan Africa [<a href="#n44">44</a>, <a
      href="#n49">49</a>]. The few instances of homosexuality noted
      are related to societal institutions where an older man has
      authority over younger males. In the Bwamba of Central
      Africa, a male teacher of some young boys was reported to
      have exposed his penis and then asked the boys to "blow it
      like a whistle" [<a href="#n50">50</a>]. Homosexuality
      probably also exists to some extent in migrant labor camps,
      where few women are present. These anecdotal accounts do not
      indicate widespread homosexuality like that which seems to
      occur in some societies. Nowhere is traditional African
      society is there the kind of sequential homosexual activity
      between men that is found in urban Western societies.</p>

      <p class="text2">This pattern seems to hold in urban areas of
      Africa. Most Africanists uniformly deny the presence of
      significant homosexual activity, as do Africans themselves.
      It was reportedly difficult to obtain African labor for
      railroad work in East Africa because Africans were revolted
      by the homosexual practices of Indian laborers that they
      refused to work with them [<a href="#n51">51</a>]. It is
      likely that, as elsewhere in the world, there are pockets of
      homosexuality in Africa, but homosexuality does not seem to
      be practiced as overtly and commonly as in other parts of the
      world.</p>

      <p class="text2">The apparent lack of AIDS among homosexuals
      in Africa also supports the absence of significant homosexual
      activity. However, a caveat must be injected here: many field
      workers have noted that it is difficult to obtain accurate
      information on sexual practices that Africans perceive to be
      offensive to Westerners. In addition, homosexuality is
      illegal in many African countries. Moreover, there is a
      common desire for informants to answer any question with the
      answer that the questioner is perceived to want. An accurate
      survey of homosexuality in urban areas has probably never
      been conducted.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although the spread of AIDS in Africa seems
      to be primarily a heterosexual process, studies of the
      frequency and distribution of homosexuality in Africa need to
      be done. Needless to say, such studies would be difficult to
      carry out because of the sociologic and political obstacles
      that have already been mentioned.</p>

      <p class="text2">Another practice that is correlated with the
      acquisition of AIDS in Western societies is anal intercourse.
      There is less information available on anal intercourse than
      on homosexuality. Again, this as a practice whose existence
      is denied by Africanists who specialize in Central African
      societies (e.g., K. Obbo and I. Schuster, personal
      communications) as well as Africans themselves. The only
      significant reports of significant rates of anal intercourse
      are claims made by students of genital mutilation [<a
      href="#n8">8, 9</a>], who state that anal intercourse is used
      of necessity in cases of infibulation. However this practice
      is mostly limited to Arabic-influenced areas rather than
      Central Africa. It must be mentioned that societal
      disapproval of the practices of homosexuality and anal
      intercourse also exists as a result of the prevalence of
      Christianity in Central and East Africa. Catholicism, which
      is one of the strongest forces opposing homosexuality, is
      common in Central Africa, encompassing over 50% of the
      population in Rwanda and eastern Zaire. Any study of the
      practice of anal intercourse would be limited by all of the
      factors mentioned above.</p>

      <h3>Practices Resulting in Exposure to Blood</h3>

      <p class="text1">Bloodletting for medicinal purposes is
      common in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in rural areas. The
      practice involves a practitioner's using an instrument such
      as a razor blade or knife to make cuts deep enough to allow
      blood to flow freely. The practitioner then takes a mixture
      of ashes from leaves and rubs it into the wound, potentially
      exposing himself to the patient's blood. In eastern Zaire the
      cuts are made over the affected organ--e.g., the forehead for
      headache, the abdomen for stomach pains, and the joints for
      arthritis. A conservative estimate is that most people among
      the Lese have bloodletting (chanja) performed at least five
      times per year from infancy onward. Many people have more
      than 100 chanjas performed yearly. (R. Bailey, personal
      communication). The practice is primarily rural but continues
      to some extent in urban areas.</p>

      <p class="text2">Traditional rural healers and midwives also
      are occasionally exposed to blood during their duties.
      African birthing practices can involve a minimum of
      interference (such as the in the !Kung San, where the woman
      gives birth in an isolated area) or active interference
      (e.g., pulling the baby from the uterous by force). Among the
      Efe of Zaire, a woman is assisted by other women, one of who
      inserts her fingers into the vagina periodically to monitor
      the baby's position. After birth, the umbilical cord is cut
      with a hunting arrow [<a href="#n52">52</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Blood brotherhood was formerly a widespread
      practice in much of East and Central Africa, especially along
      pastoral groups such as the Masai of Kenya and Tanzania and
      the Bokongo of Zaire [<a href="#n53">53</a>]. Louis Leakey
      became a blood brother in the Masai tribe in Kenya [<a
      href="#n">54</a>]. This practice has been decreasing in
      recent years. The custom involves exchanging a small amount
      of venous blood via the binding of excisions. This practice
      is typically prevalent among males only, although some
      females have reportedly become "blood brothers" [<a
      href="#n50">50</a>]. A male may become blood brothers with
      several people, but the custom is usually limited to members
      of a person's own tribe. One report identifies a case of AIDS
      possibly acquired from blood brotherhood, but other risk
      factors may have been present [<a href="#n55">55</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">Enemas, usually of local herbs and water,
      are commonly given for both ritual and medicinal purposes in
      Central and Southern Africa. To date AIDS virus has not been
      found in stool, so it is difficult to ascertain a possible
      relation between AIDS transmission and the giving of enemas.
      Piot et al. [<a href="#n45">45</a>] found no correlation of
      the practices with AIDS in Zaire.</p>

      <p class="text2">The above-mentioned practices seem to
      present little opportunity for the transmission of AIDS virus
      on a large scale. However, occasional cases may be related to
      these practices.</p>

      <h3>Practices involving the Use of Shared Instruments</h3>

      <p class="text2">Many researchers have raised the possibility
      that unsterilized or shared needles may be responsible for
      AIDS transmission in Africa. "Injection doctors" are common
      in many third-world countries. These are usually untrained
      traveling practitioners who administer over-the-counter
      parenteral antibiotics. Their practice involves intramuscular
      injections, usually with equipment that is less than
      optimally sterilized, for a wide variety of indications. Many
      in not most of the indications would not be treated with
      antibiotics (oral or parenteral) in developed countries.
      However, clinics and other more formal medical providers in
      developing countries may also reuse improperly sterilized
      equipment (L. Altman, personal communication). A high
      incidence of abscesses related to injections has been
      reported in many countries [<a href="#n56">56</a>].</p>

      <p class="text2">A major difference between drug use by
      addicts in the West and drug administration by injection
      doctors is that iv-drug users inject substances directly into
      the bloodstream and often draw blood back into the syringe to
      ascertain whether the needle is in the vein, whereas
      injection doctors utilize im injection, which involves less
      exposure to blood. (Intravenous-drug abuse in reportedly rare
      in Africa, but insufficient hard data exist on this point.)
      Needle stick injuries can transmit HIV [<a
      href="#n57">57</a>] but this mode of transmission is
      relatively uncommon [<a href="#n58">58,59</a>]. The
      injections administered by injection doctors from
      contaminated syringes are often fairly widely separated in
      time, which makes transmission even less likely. HIV is
      relatively unstable in the environment and is inactivated by
      a number of substances [<a href="#n60">60</a>]. However,
      high-tier virus was found to be infective in a dried state at
      room temperature for 3 days [<a href="#n61">61</a>]. It is
      unknown what relation this finding has to the survival of
      low-titer virus on a syringe.</p>

      <p class="text2">Previous studies have reported no relation
      between AIDS cases and needle exposure [<a href="#n2">2</a>,
      <a href="#n45">45</a>, <a href="#n62">62</a>, <a
      href="#n63">63</a>], but exposure to needles is common among
      both patients and controls. Mann et al. [<a
      href="#n64">64</a>, <a href="#n65">65</a>] recently reported
      a possible correlation between a history of injections and
      AIDS in Zaire. However, as patients with AIDS became sicker,
      they may have sought out injections as a possible cure, with
      a resulting bias in the findings of these authors. Other
      evidence against needles as a major cause of HIV transmission
      includes the relatively low number of childhood AIDS cases
      and the presence of AIDS in upper-class Central Africans who
      do not use unsterilized needles.</p>

      <p class="text2">A subset of practitioners that can spread
      HIV may exists. Further studies on the use of injections in
      AIDS patients are required. It may be possible to culture
      used needles for HIV or to test for transmission by needles
      in a primate model. The whole area of viral transmission by
      inanimate objects is currently poorly understood;
      fortunately, the topic seems amenable to laboratory
      investigation.</p>

      <p class="text2">Other African cultural practices involve the
      use of shared instruments. These practices &ndash;
      scarification, group circumcision, and genital tatooing
      &ndash; are associated with traditional African societies [<a
      href="#n44">44</a>]. As westernization and urbanization
      continue, such practices are becoming increasingly less
      common. Scarification in particular is highly disapproved of
      by missionaries. Colonial governments banned scarification at
      one time, and this prohibition left a negative attitude even
      in postcolonial times. However, it is difficult to generalize
      about any cultural trait in Africa since cultural differences
      differ widely from tribe to tribe.</p>

      <p class="text2">Scarification is probably the commonest of
      all practices involving shared instruments. It is found among
      many groups in West, Central, and East Africa (e.g., Nuba,
      Dinka, Tiv [<a href="#n66">66</a>]). Typically, cuts are made
      for beautification as well as ritual purposes. Linear scars
      are produced by deep cuts with a sharp instrument. For round
      cuts a hooked horn is typically used to life the skin and
      pull it up, and a small razor blade or knife is used to slice
      the raised skin and produce a prominent scar [<a
      href="#n66">66</a>]. Keloid formation is often a desired
      result. Scarification is carried out during multiple
      procedures at different ages throughout childhood, with
      puberty being especially important. The ritual explanation is
      that these scars enforce group affiliation and promote tribal
      integration. The marks vary from tribe to tribe and can
      include both facial markings and body markings as earlobe
      stretching. Possible exposure to virus results from the
      sharing of an instrument to perform the operations. The
      rarity of AIDS in children argues against scarification as a
      significant factor in the transmission of HIV.</p>

      <p class="text2">Another form of scarification involves a
      type of witchcraft in which the subject (often a young
      batchelor) puts a mixture believed to have magic properties
      on a razor blade or knife, unobstrusively approaches an
      unwilling victim (typically) a young woman), and makes an
      incision in the victim's back or arm [<a href="#n50">50</a>].
      In rural Africa razor blades are often difficult to come by;
      thus they are frequently used by more than one individual for
      a number of functions, such as shaving facial or body hair.
      The shaving of body hair has been noted to occur in Rwanda
      and other parts of Central and North Africa for purposes of
      beautification [<a href="#n66">66</a>]. Again, despite the
      constraints of an unstable virus, AIDS transmission may be at
      least theoretically possible, if unlikely.</p>

      <p class="text2">Another variant of scarification includes
      genital tattooing, which is practiced in parts of Central and
      North Africa (e.g., Ashanti; K. Paige, personal
      communication). In females the practice involves repetitive
      insertion of a nonsterilized needle with pigment directly
      into the labia and vaginal wall. Similarly, traditional
      circumcision or subincision practices involve the cutting of
      the foreskin of young males around puberty. These practices
      are often performed at long intervals (10-20 years) in each
      village; thus a relatively large number of individuals of
      varying ages will be operated on at one time. Since one
      instrument is typically used, it is conceivable that viral
      transmission could occur, although the physical constraints
      on viral survival would apply. It should be mentioned that
      "ritual activities are usually performed separately for males
      and females, so that we might expect patterns of transfer to
      be female-to-female and male to male. Further research in an
      area where AIDS antibodies and ritual scarification are
      prevalent may determine whether clustering of cases occurs by
      sex or by age--patterns that might point to nonsexual
      transmission of HIV.</p>

      <h3>Contact with Nonhuman Primates</h3>

      <p class="text2">Isolation of HIV-like viruses from African
      green monkeys and macaques has raised the possibility that
      AIDS has somehow been passed to humans from non-human
      primates. Such transmission could have been an isolated, rare
      event, with HIV evolving independently from a single point of
      origin. It is also possible, though less likely, that such
      transmission occurs relatively frequently and some amount of
      AIDS in Africa is the result of recurrent transmission from
      monkeys. Desrosiers [<a href="#n67">67</a>] has pointed out
      that the low degree (&lt;75%) of sequence homology between
      human T-cell-lymphotropic virus type
      III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus (HTLV-III/LAV) and
      STLV-III<sub>AGM</sub>, argues against recent tranmission of
      viruses from monkeys to humans.</p>

      <p class="text2">The presence in West Africa of
      STLV-III<sub>AGM</sub>, which is different from HIV in
      Central Africa and the West, points to several sources of
      origin of HIV in Africa. However, the extremely high rate of
      mutation of HIV may also be responsible for this viral
      variability.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="Fig3.gif" alt="Map of green monkey habitat" /> 

        <p><b>Figure 3.</b> Distribution of <i>Cercopithecus
        aethiops</i> (see [<a href="#n69">69</a>]).</p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">To date, African green monkeys
      (<i>Cercopithecus aethiops</i>, or vervets) are the only
      species reported to have an AIDS-type virus in the wild [<a
      href="#n68">68</a>]. Hence vervets are the principal suspect
      in the transmission of disease. Although the distribution of
      the vervet's forest-fringe and savannah habitats does not
      overlap perfectly with the currently known distribution of
      AIDS (particularly central Zaire), the degree of overlap is
      generally fairly good (figure 3) [<a href="#n69">69</a>].
      This opportunistic and ecologically adaptable primate species
      is spread widely, if discontinuously, throughout areas of
      high HIV seropositivity.</p>

      <p class="text2">The existence of STLV-III<sub>AGM</sub> is
      wild vervets may be relevant to the situation in humans.
      There is a striking analogy between promiscuity as a risk
      factor in humans and the "promisuous" behavior of vervets.
      Typically, female vervets, unlike baboons, are sexually
      receptive for long periods (many weeks [<a
      href="#n70">70</a>]) and during that time mate with multiple
      male partners, sometimes engaging in dozens of copulations on
      a single day -- activity that may lead to traumatic lesions
      of the vaginal or perineal area. Although vervets do not
      exhibit the large and fragile "sexual swellings common to
      other cercopithecine monkeys (like baboons), vervet perineal
      skin is slightly edematous during the breeding season.
      Exposure to multiple sexual partners may be a factor in the
      spread of STLV-III<sub>AGM</sub> throughout vervet
      populations. However, other factors, such as between-group
      transfer, population structure, and ecologic variables, must
      be studied in order to determine how the virus spreads in
      primates.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although a possible source of exposure of
      humans to monkey virus is bites from monkeys kept as pets,
      the commonest type of exposure to monkeys, including vervets,
      is the hunting of monkeys for meat. In all rural areas and in
      many cities (e.g., Kigali, the capital of Rwanda), smoked
      monkeys are a common food item for sale in markets [<a
      href="#n71">71</a>]. The monkeys are either trapped or shot,
      eviscerated, and prepared for eating by singeing of the hair
      and then smoking of the carcass over a fire. During the
      evisceration process, humans are exposed to blood and
      internal secretions that presumably contain virus. Although
      smoked monkeys are sold throughout sub-Saharan Africa, monkey
      hunting is mainly limited to forested areas. These forested
      areas occur most prominently in Central Africa. Actual
      transmission of virus to humans through this process would
      require a break in the skin for systemic viral absorption.
      Although monkeys are eaten throughout sub-Saharan Africa, it
      is extremely unlikely that the eating of monkeys per se is a
      source of virus exposure. As has been mentioned, it is far
      more likely that any transmission of HIV-like viruses from
      monkeys to humans has occurred as a rare event rather than as
      a recurring transmission pattern.</p>

      <p class="text2">Another source of interspecific transmission
      of AIDS virus could be arthropod vectors. A recent report of
      survival of HIV in bedbugs supports this hypothesis [<a
      href="#n72">72</a>]. Since adequate testing of insect species
      in the wild has not been carried out, it is not clear whether
      vector-borne virus transmission plays an important part in
      the epidemiology of AIDS. Even a low-titer presence in
      insects could be a source of rare transmission between humans
      and nonhuman primates. However, more data are needed on this
      point.</p>

      <p class="text2">Questions that require further study include
      the following: (<i>1</i>) What is the distribution of
      HIV-like viruses in wild primate populations? (<i>2</i>) Do
      monkeys other than vervets (many of them also exhibiting
      promiscuous mating habits [<a href="#n73">73</a>]) also have
      HIV-like viruses in the wild? (<i>3</i>) What is the genetic
      interrelation of primate HIV-like viruses? (<i>4</i>) Do
      areas where vervets are hunted overlap with areas of AIDS
      seropositivity (especially in rural regions)? (<i>5</i>) In
      what monkey tissues is the HIV-like virus present, and are
      humans exposed to these tissues? (<i>6</i>) How easily can
      different HIV-like viruses be transferred between species by
      various routes?</p>
