      <h2>Prevalence of male circumcision and its association with
      HIV<br />
       and sexually transmitted infections in a U.S. navy
      population</h2>

      <h4>A G Thomas, L N Bakhireva, S K Brodine, R A Shaffer</h4>

      <h4>Abstract:</h4>

      <p><b>Background:</b> Lack of male circumcision has been
      found to be a risk factor for HIV and sexually transmitted
      infection (STI) in several studies performed in developing
      countries. However, the few studies conducted in developed
      nations have yielded inconsistent results. Policy regarding
      circumcision of male infants as a prevention measure against
      HIV/STI remains a controversial topic. This study describes
      the prevalence of circumcision and its association with HIV
      and STI in a U.S. military population.</p>

      <p><b>Methods:</b> This is a case-control study of male HIV
      infected U.S. military personnel (n= 232) recruited from 7
      military medical centers and male U.S. Navy controls (n=516)
      from a general aircraft carrier population. Cases and
      controls completed similar self-administered HIV behavioral
      risk surveys. Case circumcision status was abstracted from
      medical charts while control status was reported on the
      survey. Cases and controls were frequency matched on age.
      Multiple logistic regressions were constructed separately to
      evaluate the role of circumcision in the acquisition of HIV
      and STI.</p>

      <p><b>Results:</b> <span class="yellow">The proportion of
      circumcised men did not significantly differ between cases
      (84.9%) and controls (81.8%).</span> Prevalence of
      circumcision among men born in the U.S. was higher (85.0%)
      than those born elsewhere (58.1%). After adjustment for
      demographic and behavioral risk factors lack of circumcision
      was not found to be a risk factor for HIV (OR = 0.9; 95% CI:
      0.51, 1.7) or STI (OR = 1.08; 95% CI 0.52, 2.26). The odds of
      HIV infection were 2.6 higher for irregular condom users, 5
      times as high for those reporting STI, 6.2 times higher for
      those reporting anal sex, 2.8-3.2 times higher for those with
      2-7+ partners, nearly 3 times higher for Blacks, and 3.5
      times as high for men who were single or
      divorced/separated.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusions:</b> <span class="yellow">Although there
      may be other medical or cultural reasons for male
      circumcision, it is not associated with HIV or STI prevention
      in this U.S. military population.</span></p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Comment: This study found that 84.9
      percent of infected males were circumcised as compared with
      81.8 percent of non-infected men were circumcised. This
      difference (3.1%) may not be statistically significance,
      however, it does show a higher percentage of circumcised
      males among those who are infected.]</p>
