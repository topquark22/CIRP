      <p>Recent epidemiological studies have shown fairly
      convincingly that in high-risk populations in sub-Saharan
      Africa, male circumcision is associated with a reduced risk
      of HIV infection. Following a consultation at the XIII
      International AIDS Conference in July 2000 in Durban, there
      was growing interest in such an intervention. This paper
      explores what is known about male circumcision, the risks
      associated with it, its relationship with sexual health,
      including HIV and other sexually transmitted infections
      (STIs), and the potential problems with implementing
      circumcision as an intervention internationally, particularly
      in traditionally non-circumcising communities and those where
      access to medical facilities is limited. <span
      class="yellow">Proponents of male circumcision as an HIV
      prevention strategy are convinced and convincing, but
      circumcision is a surgical procedure with associated risks
      and has strong religious and cultural significance for many
      groups. Hence, there are ethical and practical barriers to
      implementing it as a public health intervention. The evidence
      suggests that circumcision may reduce the risk of infection,
      but circumcision does not appear to have any impact on
      transmission rates from HIV positive men to their partners.
      Until we know why and how circumcision is protective, exactly
      what the relationship is between circumcision status and
      other STIs, and whether the effect seen in high-risk
      populations is generalisable to other groups, the wisest
      course is to recommend risk reduction strategies of proven
      efficacy, such as condom use.</span></p>
