      <p>Heterosexual intercourse accounts for 80% of HIV
      transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. <span
      class="yellow">Factors facilitating cross-infection may
      include sexual practices such as the vaginal use of
      herbs/substances to dry, contract and heat the vagina for
      enhancement of sexual pleasure.</span> The
      behavioural-analytic study investigated the use of different
      types of herbs/substances used by 75 HIV positive and 76
      negative sexually active females and the perceived effects of
      these agents. Individual in-depth interviews were conducted.
      99% of all subjects admitted using herbs/substances mainly to
      contract (94%), dry (58%) and heat (28%) the vagina. There
      was no significant difference in the pattern of use of herbs
      and reasons given for using the agents by HIV positive and
      negative women. 69% of HIV negative and 80% of positive
      subjects had used a mean of 4 difference types of herbs
      and/or substances during the last 5 years. 39% negative and
      25% positive subjects had experienced intra-vaginal pain and
      lower abdominal pains during and after sexual intercourse,
      laceration of the vagina and excessive vaginal secretions
      after using herbs. These effects were attributed to Wankie
      (herb or substance) in 70% of the complaints. 14 HIV positive
      subjects compared with 7 in the negative group had used
      Wankie. <span class="yellow">The role of Wankie and similar
      substances in transmitting HIV cross-infection requires
      further investigations. From the point of view of AIDS
      prevention, expectations of a dry and contracted vagina in
      sexual intercourse may reduce acceptability and use of female
      and male condoms.</span></p>
