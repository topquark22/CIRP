      Human Immunodeficiency Virus</h2>

      <p><b>To the Editor:</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Bailey comments on the association between
      circumcision and reduced rate of acquisition of HIV-1 in male
      subjects in our study of couples discordant for HIV-1 status.
      <span class="yellow">Although circumcision was strongly
      associated with reduced acquisition of HIV-1 in these highly
      exposed couples, additional analyses suggest that
      generalization to the whole population is complicated by
      confounding.</span> (<a href="#n1">1</a>) <span
      class="yellow">In our representative population in Rakai, we
      found that circumcision was associated with a reduced rate of
      HIV-1 acquisition; this was particularly true for
      circumcision performed before puberty. However, this effect
      was mainly due to the lower incidence of HIV-1 among Muslims,
      who constitute the largest group of circumcised males.
      Circumcision was not significantly protective among
      non-Muslim men or in couples in which both partners were
      HIV-1-negative.</span> (<a href="#n1">1</a>) <span
      class="yellow">The 30 African epidemiologic studies mentioned
      by Bailey are mainly cross-sectional investigations with
      inconsistent findings and inadequate control for potential
      confounding. These observational data are difficult to
      interpret, and clinical trials are needed before circumcision
      can be promoted as a means of preventing HIV
      infection.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Fremont-Smith questions the proportion of
      subjects with undetectable viral loads in our study on the
      basis of a comparison with a subgroup analysis from the
      Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (<a href="#n2">2</a>) and a
      previous report that plasma HIV-1 RNA levels tend to be
      higher in sub-Saharan Africa. (<a href="#n3">3</a>)
      Unfortunately, these studies cannot be directly compared with
      ours. Both studies referred to by Fremont-Smith used plasma,
      whereas we used serum. HIV-1 RNA levels in plasma are 30 to
      80 percent higher than those in serum, (<a href="#n4">4</a>)
      so specimens with low levels of HIV-1 RNA in plasma may have
      undetectable levels in serum. Prolonged periods between
      collection, processing, and storage in our study may also
      have lowered viral detection, since the greatest decrease in
      RNA levels occurs within the first six hours after
      collection. However, the overall results remain internally
      valid, since the methods of sample preparation and assay were
      consistent throughout the study. Our estimate of the risk of
      transmission per log (base 10) increment in viral load is
      nearly identical to the risk observed in a study of
      mother-to-infant transmission (<a href="#n5">5</a>) and in a
      study of heterosexual transmission in Zambia (<a
      href="#n6">6</a>); this consistency further supports the
      validity of our measurements of viral levels.</p>
