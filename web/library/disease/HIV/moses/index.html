      <p class="cirp">CIRP NOTE: This is a meta-analysis in which
      the authors analyze and discuss their own earlier work. As
      such it may suffer from severe conflicts of interest and a
      lack of objectivity. This work appeared the same year as the
      independent meta-analysis by <a
      href="/library/disease/HIV/vincenzi/">de Vincenzi and
      Mertens</a>, who reached very different conclusions even
      though they analyzed much of the same data.</p>

      <p><b>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:</b> Whether male
      circumcision reduces the risk of acquiring human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains
      controversial.</p>

      <p><b>STUDY DESIGN:</b> As there have now been a number of
      studies conducted that have examined this issue, we undertook
      to review their findings. Thirty epidemiological studies
      identified in the literature that investigated the
      association between male circumcision status and risk for HIV
      infection were reviewed.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> Eighteen cross-sectional studies from six
      countries reported a statistically significant association,
      four studies from four countries found a trend toward an
      association. Four studies from two countries found no
      association. Two prospective studies reported significant
      associations, as did two ecological studies. In studies in
      which significant associations were demonstrated, measures of
      increased risk ranged from 1.5 to 8.4. The groups in which
      positive associations were found included sexually
      transmitted disease (STD) clinic and hospital patients,
      outpatient clinic and HIV screening clinic attenders,
      long-distance truck drivers, and general community
      members.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b> Potential sources of error, assessment
      of causality, implications of the findings, and future
      research needs are discussed. Because a substantial body of
      evidence links noncircumcision in men with risk for HIV
      infection, consideration should be given to male circumcision
      as an intervention to reduce HIV transmission.</p>
