      <h2>The use and physical effects of intravaginal substances
      in Zairian women</h2>

      <p><b>RC Brown, JE Brown, OB Ayowa</b></p>

      <p>Institut M&eacute;dical Chr&eacute;tien du
      Kasa&iuml;,<br />
       Kananga, Zaire.</p>

      <p>Women in Kananga, Zaire, sometimes insert substances into
      the vagina to enhance sexual pleasure. The objective of this
      study was to ascertain: 1) what intravaginal substances are
      used, 2) the prevalence and frequency of their use, and 3)
      the visible effects they produce on the female genitalia.
      Focus group discussions with women and men were conducted,
      and both prostitutes and non-prostitutes were interviewed
      individually about their sexual preferences and practices.
      The cervices and vaginae of eight women were inspected and
      photographed before and after the insertion of commonly used
      substances. It was found that Kananga residents preferred a
      "dry-tight" vagina during coitus. They named thirty
      substances (leaves and powders) that women insert to produce
      this sensation. Twenty-one of 50 prostitutes (42%), and 17 of
      49 non-prostitutes (35%), had used such intravaginal
      substances. <span class="yellow">Inspection of the genitalia
      showed that five different leaves produced inflammatory
      reactions that lasted up to a week. These genital irritations
      might facilitate the transmission of pathogenic organisms.
      Investigators elsewhere should study the use of intravaginal
      substances and their relationship to sexually transmitted
      diseases.</span></p>
