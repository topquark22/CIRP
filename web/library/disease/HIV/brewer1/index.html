      <h3 class="section">Introduction</h3>

      <p class="text1">There is substantial dissonance between much
      of the epidemiologic evidence and the current orthodoxy that
      nearly all of the HIV burden in sub-Saharan Africa can be
      accounted for by heterosexual transmission and the sexual
      behaviour of Africans. The mounting toll of HIV infection in
      Africa is paralleled by a mounting number of anomalies in the
      many studies seeking to account for it. <span
      class="yellow">We propose that existing data can no longer be
      reconciled with the received wisdom about the exceptional
      role of sex in the African AIDS epidemic.</span></p>

      <h3 class="section">Anomalies in sub-Saharan Africa</h3>

      <p class="text1">Discontinuity between HIV and STIs During
      the 1990s HIV propagated rapidly in Zimbabwe, increasing at
      an estimated rate of 12% annually. At the same time, the
      overall sexually transmitted infections (STI) burden declined
      an estimated 25% and while there was a parallel increase in
      reported condom use by high-risk persons (prostitutes, lorry
      drivers, miners, and young people)<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup>. This example frames the problem: why
      would a relatively low efficiency sexually transmitted virus
      like HIV outrun more efficiently transmitted STI<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup>? In the notable four-cities
      study<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>, many common sexual risk
      factors linked to HIV transmission (eg, high rate of partner
      change, sex with prostitutes, and low condom use) were not
      correlated with HIV prevalence-although some risk markers
      (young age at first coitus or marriage, large age difference
      between partners) and presumed facilitating factors (lack of
      circumcision, genital herpes, and trichomoniasis, but not
      bacterial STI) were. In addition, concurrency of sexual
      partnerships was not correlated with HIV prevalence, yet was
      associated with bacterial STI<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup>.It is of concern that many key sexual
      transmission variables are not associated with a large HIV
      epidemic in Africa, yet do correlate, as expected, with other
      STIs.</p>

      <h4 class="subsection">Transmission efficiency</h4>

      <p class="text1">A study of HIV transmission efficiency in
      Africa, using data from serodiscordant couples<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup>, produced estimates remarkably similar
      to those reported for couples in the developed world<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup>. Observed probabilities presumably
      reflect some of the influence of facilitating factors (eg,
      unorthodox sexual practices, circumcision status, STI
      exposure, etc) recruited to explain the 'turbo effect'<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> noted in Africa's epidemiologic
      context. Recent empiric research casts doubt that such
      co-factors can sufficiently amplify the force of infectivity
      to account for observed trends in the sexual transmission of
      HIV in Africa<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>. The anomalies
      regarding transmission efficiency are well illustrated by a
      recent study in South Africa<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>.
      The authors recognized that, to explain HIV acquisition by
      16-18 year old women in their study, they needed to postulate
      a per partnership transmission probability of 0.92 (0.49,
      assuming double the number of reported partnerships per
      woman). By extension, the per-contact probability of
      transmission would be 0.34, making heterosexual sex in this
      context second only to transfusion in HIV transmission
      efficiency. Similarly, a model developed to assess the impact
      of STI on transmission of HIV posited an extraordinary
      33-fold increase in transmission efficiency of the latter in
      the presence of the former<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup>.</p>

      <h4 class="subsection">Reported sexual activity</h4>

      <p class="text1">Levels of sexual activity reported in a
      dozen general population surveys in Africa<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> are comparable to those reported
      elsewhere, especially in North America and Europe. Perhaps
      more importantly, there appears to be little correlation with
      the level of risky sexual behaviour shown in these surveys
      and the epidemic trajectories observed in these countries.
      (Comparison with country-specific data reported by UNAIDS
      2000; data not shown.) The four-city study provides similar
      discordance<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>. For example,
      Yaounde (in Cameroon, a nation with low and stable
      prevalence) had the highest level of risky behavioural
      markers. Ndola (in Zambia, a nation that has experienced a
      rapid rise in HIV) had the smallest proportion of both men
      and women who reported a non-spousal sex partner in the
      previous 12 months. Ndola's other markers were similar to
      those in Dakar, Senegal and Cotonou, Benin, other areas with
      low, stable prevalence.</p>

      <h4 class="subsection">Transmission dynamics</h4>

      <p class="text1">Rapid propagation (of at least bacterial
      STI) has been associated with core groups<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup>, which make up a small proportion of
      the susceptible population and are proposed to be responsible
      for most community transmission. Such groups appear to be
      associated with differing forms of sexual net-work
      'geometry'. This geometry demonstrably differs with
      transmission intensity<sup><a href="#n14">14-16</a></sup>.
      Evidence suggests that endemic and declining HIV/STI burdens
      are associated with dendritic (many open-ended termini)
      patterns of sexual partner connections, while epidemicity is
      associated with cyclic (closed loops, reflecting cohesiveness
      and density) patterns. There are few data on the architecture
      of sociosexual networks in Africa, but the available
      information suggests predominantly dendritic patterns (eg,
      contact with prostitutes and then contact with stable and
      usually monogamous consorts who are network termini). We are
      aware of no study from sub-Saharan Africa suggesting cyclic
      sexual network architecture. Without evidence of appropriate
      network configurations on a scale considerably larger than
      that observed in developed countries, rapid propagation of
      HIV in Africa would be difficult to sustain.</p>

      <p class="text1">Studies have associated putative sexual core
      groups with HIV transmission in Africa. For example, women
      who work as prostitutes and their partners have frequently
      been observed to have high HIV prevalence. Confusion may
      arise, however, over conflating the terms 'high risk person'
      and 'core group'. The former have been labelled in some way,
      but are not necessarily part of an interconnected group of
      individuals through whom infection percolates (ie, core
      group). As noted, such persons would have to be part of an
      interactive, cyclic group, rather than nodes along a
      dendritic chain.</p>

      <h4 class="subsection">Other anomalous findings</h4>

      <p class="text1">A higher HIV prevalence has been observed in
      women seen in prenatal, postpartum, and induced abortion
      settings than in their community counter-parts<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup>. In a number of studies, there
      appears to be a discrepancy between the observed prevalence
      in women undergoing reproductive medical care, and the
      prevalence that would be observed in such a group from
      heterosexual transmission alone. Though few in number, there
      continue to be reports of HIV seropositivity in persons
      denying coital exposure and in persons claiming a sole
      lifetime sexual partner who is reportedly HIV negative<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup>. Similarly, there are persistent
      reports of HIV in infants with seronegative mothers<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup>. A recent large survey from South
      Africa measured an HIV prevalence of 5.6% in children 2-14
      years of age 18. Given mortality from HIV among children who
      acquire it in Africa, there would appear to be a substantial
      proportion of such a disease burden that is unexplained by
      maternal and sexual transmission.</p>

      <h4 class="subsection">Alternatives</h4>

      <p class="text1">A number of these observations raise the
      question of an alternative route of transmission, for which
      medical care and the use of injections are prime
      candidates<sup><a href="#n17">17</a>,<a
      href="#n19">19-22</a></sup>. Prostitutes, for example, are
      often recruited for studies from STI clinics, where treatment
      is frequently given by injection, where non-sterile equipment
      is used with high frequency, and wherein the underlying
      prevalence of HIV is high<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>. Many
      studies that have assessed the impact of sexual activity on
      HIV transmission -notably those in Mwanza and Rakai, whose
      discordant results are still a subject of debate<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup>-failed to consider the potential
      confounding effects of medical care in the propagation of
      HIV<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">Rapid HIV transmission in Africa has often
      occurred in countries with good access to medical care, like
      Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. For example, high rates
      in rural South Africa have paralleled aggressive efforts to
      deliver health care to rural populations. It is difficult to
      understand how improved access to health care, with its
      offers of public health messages, free condoms, and
      preventive services, would be associated with increased HIV
      transmission. Similarly, HIV prevalence is often higher in
      cities and among persons of high socioeconomic attainment
      than in rural areas or among less fortunate persons.
      Favourable access to health care is one of the differences
      that distinguishes between these groups.</p>

      <h3 class="section">Reactions to the anomalies and
      alternatives</h3>

      <p class="text1">Since early in the African epidemic, when
      AIDS was demographically associated with sexually active
      populations<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup>, <span
      class="yellow">studies of HIV transmission in Africa have
      generally failed to control for possible parenteral
      confounding</span><sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup>. The
      importance of this route of infection was well known in the
      West and in Asia but quickly dismissed in Africa<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup>. The risk of parenteral transmission
      of HIV is based on good estimates of transmission efficiency,
      which varies depending on type of injection and circumstances
      that produce reuse of contaminated equipment. For example,
      needle stick exposure (HIV transmission probability: about
      one in 300<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup>, medical injection
      (recently estimated at approximately one in 30<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup>), or illicit-drug injection (about
      one in 100<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup>), is much more
      efficient than penile-vaginal exposure (about one in
      1000<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup>).</p>

      <p class="text2">There is the expectation that, were
      iatrogenic transmission of HIV common, one would notice
      substantial HIV prevalence in populations of (non-sexually
      experienced) children. Regrettably, although a large
      proportion of Africa's population falls in that category, few
      serosurveys conducted in Africa have included large enough
      samples from, say, children aged five through 12 to
      confidently dismiss this possibility. As more information
      accumulates that addresses this issue, a clearer perspective
      on the magnitude of non-sexual, non-maternal transmission in
      children will emerge.</p>

      <p class="text2">The risk of exposure to HIV via medical
      injections is likely to vary with background prevalence and
      with the specific medical practices in different settings.
      The demand for consistency and coherence that we have placed
      on the heterosexual hypothesis should be applied to
      estimating the role of medical transmission. Its role should
      vary with background (initial) prevalence, and should be
      related to the degree of medical hygiene exercised. The same
      biological basis that exists for heterosexual transmission
      should be established for medical transmission. (As an aside,
      such a demonstration poses substantial ethical problems. No
      investigator should knowingly observe the use of a needle
      that has a high probability of being contaminated with HIV,
      but at a minimum, the demonstration of HIV RNA in needles
      that were to have been used on patients would be an important
      element in establishing a biological base.) The transmission
      of blood-borne pathogens with differing biological
      characteristics, notably hepatitis B and C<sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup>, should be consistent with
      parenteral transmission of HIV. Finally, the social
      epidemiology of HIV (male to female ratios, for example)
      should be consistent with observations about non-sexual
      exposure.</p>

      <h3 class="section">Conclusion</h3>

      <p class="text1">In North America, Europe, and many parts of
      Asia, the ignition of regional epidemics and rapid HIV
      transmission has been associated principally with the sharing
      of contaminated injecting equipment and with anal
      intercourse. Though heterosexual intercourse has been
      virtually the sole explanation offered for the AIDS epidemic
      in sub-Saharan Africa, to our knowledge in no other part of
      the world has penile-vaginal exposure (as opposed to
      'heterosexual sex') been demonstrated to initiate or sustain
      rapid HIV propagation.</p>

      <p class="text2">HIV is not transmitted by 'sex', but only by
      specific risky practices. It is not transmitted by
      'injections', but only by contaminated implements, which need
      to be clearly differentiated as to type and frequency of
      injection and by the conditions of the exposure setting. In
      virtually all societies affected by HIV to date, both routes
      seem to play important roles. If we are to understand and
      intervene in each of these epidemics, well-designed studies
      at both the population and individual levels are urgently
      needed. It is vital that these be properly controlled for
      parenteral exposure, specific sexual practices, and other
      co-factors<sup><a href="#n2">2</a>,<a href="#n17">17</a>,<a
      href="#n24">24</a>,<a href="#n32">32</a></sup> and the
      complex and specific social patterns and networks that
      accompany them<sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup>.</p>

      <p class="text2">Dispassionate assessment of our conclusions
      admittedly depends on a willing suspension of disbelief,
      since the current paradigm is deeply embedded. Counter
      arguments can (and will) be levelled at each of the anomalies
      noted, but the depth and breadth of concerns deserve fair
      scrutiny. <span class="yellow">At issue in a re-evaluation of
      the heterosexual hypothesis are the profound implications for
      our interventive approach, and for the kinds of social and
      financial commitments that must be made. Finally, Africans
      deserve scientifically sound information on the epidemiologic
      determinants of their calamitous AIDS epidemic.</span></p>
