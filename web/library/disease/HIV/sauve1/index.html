      <p><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> To describe the epidemiology of HIV
      infection in the Manya Krobo District, Ghana, and its
      potential link to the building of the Akosombo dam.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> A questionnaire and a blood sample were
      collected among 1228 consecutive pregnant women seen at the
      prenatal clinics of the two major hospitals of the
      district.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS</b>: Overall, prevalence of HIV and of
      serologically confirmed syphilis were 14.9% and 0.7%,
      respectively. HIV infection was more prevalent among the
      Krobo ethnic group (137 of 742 [18.5%]) than among other
      ethnic groups (46 of 486 [9.5%]; p &lt;.001). Two distinct
      patterns of HIV distribution were identified. Among the
      Krobos, HIV was common among all age groups, reached a
      plateau (21.9%) in the 30- to 34-year-old group and was
      associated strongly with having lived in Cote d'Ivoire and
      with having received only primary school education. Among the
      other ethnic groups, prevalence decreased with age, from
      17.2% in the 13- to 19-year-old age group to 1.4% among women
      aged 35 years or older, and HIV infection was associated with
      having had first sexual intercourse before the age of 17
      years. In logistic regression analysis, the independent risk
      factors for HIV infection were age, schooling, age at first
      sexual intercourse; having lived in Cote d'Ivoire; age and
      schooling showed significant interactions with ethnic
      group.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The high HIV prevalence documented in
      this part of Ghana seems to be, to some extent, a consequence
      of construction of the Akosombo dam in the 1960s. The
      flooding of the land, the failures of the resettlement
      program and the ensuing poverty prompted economically driven
      migration, specially to Cote d'Ivoire, where many migrants
      became infected with HIV. Local transmission followed. <span
      class="yellow">This illustrates that HIV can disseminate
      widely in a society where most men are circumcised and where
      genital ulcerative diseases are uncommon and should be an
      indication for less complacency about HIV control in West
      Africa.</span></p>
