      <p><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> To assess the linkage of sexually
      transmitted disease (STD) symptoms and treatable STD to HIV
      incidence.</p>

      <p><b>DESIGN:</b> Analysis of a randomized trial of STD
      control for HIV prevention, Rakai, Uganda.</p>

      <p><b>METHODS:</b> Consenting adults 15-59 years of age were
      seen at 10-monthly home visits, interviewed regarding STD
      symptoms, and asked to provide samples for HIV and STD
      diagnoses. HIV incidence was determined in 8089 HIV-negative
      subjects over 10 457 person years. Adjusted rate ratios (RR)
      and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of HIV acquisition
      associated with genital ulcer disease (GUD) and
      discharge/dysuria were used to estimate the population
      attributable fraction (PAF) of HIV acquisition. HIV
      transmission risks associated with STD symptoms in
      HIV-positive partners of 167 HIV discordant couples and the
      numbers of sexual partners reported by HIV-positive subjects
      were used to estimate the PAF of HIV transmission
      attributable to STD.</p>

      <p><b>RESULTS:</b> HIV prevalence was 16%. The risk of HIV
      acquisition was increased with GUD (RR 3.14; CI 1.98-4.98)
      and in males with discharge/dysuria (RR 2.44; CI 1.17-5.12),
      but not in females with discharge/dysuria. The PAF of HIV
      acquisition was 9.5% (CI 2.8-15.8%) with any of the three STD
      symptoms. The PAF for GUD was 8.8% (CI 3.7-13.8), but only
      8.2% of reported GUD was caused by treatable syphilis or
      chancroid . The PAF for discharge/dysuria in males was 6.7%
      (CI 1.1-13.8), but only 25% of symptomatic males had
      concurrent gonorrhea or chlamydial infection. No significant
      differences were seen in PAF between study treatment arms.
      The PAF of HIV transmission associated with STD symptoms in
      HIV-positive persons was indirectly estimated to be
      10.4%.</p>

      <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b> In this mature, generalized HIV
      epidemic setting, most HIV seroconversion occurs without
      recognized STD symptoms or curable STD detected by screening.
      Therefore, syndromic management or other strategies of STD
      treatment are unlikely to substantially reduce HIV incidence
      in this population. <span class="yellow">However, STD is
      associated with significant HIV risk at the individual level,
      and STD management is needed to protect
      individuals.</span></p>
