              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the
              College</p>

              <p><b>FROM:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;Registrar</p>

              <p><b>RE:
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caution
              Against Routine Circumcision of Newborn Male
              Infants</b></p>

              <p>The practice of medicine is increasingly becoming
              evidence based. &nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strong and
              growing consensus that medical intervention should be
              based upon sound evidence of expected benefit that
              outweighs the potential risk of any such
              intervention.</p>

              <p>Where there is little evidence of expected benefit
              from a surgical procedure, but well recognized risk
              of surgical complications that may cause harm, it
              would be generally be considered imprudent if not
              improper for a surgeon to perform a surgical
              procedure.</p>

              <p>Notwithstanding these fundamental principles,
              27.6% of newborn males were circumcised in this
              province in 2000-2001, in spite of the fact that the
              Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) has for <a
              href="/library/statements/cps1975/"
              target="_blank">two and a half decades</a> explicitly
              cautioned against routine circumcision of newborn
              male infants.</p>

              <p>Since August 1996, infant circumcision has not
              been a publicly insured service in Saskatchewan. The
              decision to de-insure the service was based partly on
              the lack of valid medical indications for the
              procedure.</p>

              <p>Even though citizens must now personally pay for
              this service, the incidence of male circumcision has
              dropped only moderately over the past five years.</p>

              <p>The relatively high rate of newborn circumcision
              in Saskatchewan stands in very sharp contrast to that
              in some other regions of the country. For example, in
              Nova Scotia the rate has dropped to 1.5%, while in
              Newfoundland/Labrador it has dropped to 0.6
              percent.</p>

              <p>Such high infant circumcision rates in
              Saskatchewan in the face of an explicit caution from
              the CPS is of great concern to the College of
              Physicians and Surgeons, and ought to be a concern to
              all physicians who perform the procedure.</p>

              <p>Is it possible that so many Saskatchewan
              physicians are totally unaware of the position of the
              CPS, the research evidence that supports that
              position?</p>

              <p>If physicians are unaware of the evidence against
              routine newborn circumcision, why do they continue to
              practice in a manner that ignores this evidence?</p>

              <p>In my dialogue with Saskatchewan physicians about
              this issue, I've encountered many who claim to be
              "neutral" in their opinion about routine
              circumcision, but perform the procedure strictly on
              the basis of parental preference.</p>

               <b>Caution Against Routine Circumcision of Newborn
              Male Infants</b></p>

              <p>On the surface, that approach might seem
              commendable as it seems sensitive and responsive to
              parental values. However, it begs the question as to
              whether the parents are appropriately informed about
              the benefits and risk of this procedure. Even more
              importantly, it begs the question as to whether
              physicians are providing accurate and adequate
              informatin to parents that is likely to yield a truly
              informed decision on their part.</p>

              <p>Informed consent to any surgical procedure relies
              on an assumption that the decision maker possesses
              full and accurate information about both the benefits
              and risks of the procedure. The onus is cast upon the
              surgeon, who might perform the procedure to ensure
              that such information is not only conveyed to the
              decision maker, but is understood by the decision
              maker.</p>

              <p>It is difficult to identify any other domain of
              medicine in which physicians would feel comfortable
              playing such a passive role in a decision pathway
              culminating in surgery. It is also difficult to
              identify any other domain of medicine in which
              practice patterns stand in such contrast to reseach
              evidence.</p>

              <p>When the Council of the <a
              href="http://www.quadrant.net/cpss/"
              target="_blank">College of Physicians and
              Surgeons</a> reviewed this issue at its last meeting,
              it directed the Registrar to initiate an effective
              educational strategy to raise professional and public
              awareness of this issue. The first step in that
              strategy is this memo, which is directed to all
              members of the College who perform circumcisions, or
              are likely in a position to influence parental
              decision making on this issue.</p>

              <p>These are my recommendations to you:</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bottom">
              <p class="2">(1) First, be sure that you are fully
              and accurately informed about the research literature
              on the subject, which serves as the basis for the CPS
              position against routine circumcision of newborn male
              infants.</p>

              <p>You can obtain a copy of the <a
              href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm"
               target="_blank">CPS Position Paper</a>, and a
              succinct summary of recent research by logging on to
              the CPS website at www.cps.ca.</p>

              <p>If you are not able to access this information
              from the <a href="http://www.cps.ca/"
              target="_blank">CPS website</a>, please give Ms.
              Jo-Anne Wolan a call at the College. We will be
              pleased to send you a written copy of the CPS
              position paper.</p>

              <p class="2">(2) In any dialogue you have with the
              patients about potential circumcision of newborn male
              infants, be sure that you accurately and effectively
              convey the message that this is not a recommended
              procedure.</p>

              <p class="2">(3) If parents remain adamant in their
              preference that circumcision be performed,
              notwithstanding their awareness of the research on
              the subject, remember that you are under no
              obligation to perform any surgical procedure for
              which there are not valid medical indications. You
              can, and should respectfully decline to perform the
              procedure just as you respectfully decline to carry
              out other requested medical acts that you regard to
              be inappropriate.</p>

              <p class="2">(4) If the parental request for infant
              male circumcision is based exclusively upon religious
              beliefs and values, and you are inclined to act in
              deference to those religious beliefs and values, you
              would be prudent to require parental signature of a
              consent document which clearly stipulates that the
              circumcision in question is not medically indicated
              and is being performed in accordance with parental
              religious practices.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="corpus">
              <p>In such cases, physicians would be prudent to

               <b>May 7, 2002</b> 

              <p>TO: All family physician, pediatrician,
              obstetrician and urologist members of the College of
              Physicians and Surgeons</p>

              <p>FROM: Registrar, Dr. D.A. Kendel</p>

              <p>RE: Infant male circumcision</p>

              <p>A substantial number of College members who
              received my memo of February 20, 2002 regarding
              infant male circumcision have sought clarification
              from the College in respect of information contained
              in that memo. We are pleased to provide this
              clarification to all members who were in receipt of
              the February 20th memo.</p>

              <p>First, let me clarify that it is not the intention
              of the College of Physicians and Surgeons to prohibit
              physicians from performing infant male circumcision
              if it is their professional judgment that the
              procedure is indicated, and there is truly informed
              consent to support its performance.</p>

              <p>However, it is the view of the College that this
              surgical procedure is sometimes performed much too
              casually, without adequate attentiveness to the risk
              for patients and the surgeon.</p>

              <p><b>The Exercise of Sound Professional
              Judgment</b></p>

              <p>It is the expectation of the College that all
              physicians exercise sound professional judgment in
              all the professional decisions they make. In the
              exercise of professional judgment physicians ought to
              consider many factors, including the preference of
              patients (guardians), the best available evidence
              with respect to potential benefits and risks of a
              contemplated intervention, and alternatives to that
              intervention.</p>

              <p>While attentiveness to patient preference is
              always important, maintenance of professionalism
              demands that physicians decline to become little more
              than robots who perform an array of medical
              interventions on demand.</p>

              <p>While no patient should be coerced to undergo a
              medical procedure against his/her will, it is equally
              true that no physician should be coerced to perform a
              medical procedure that is contrary to his/her
              professional judgment.</p>

              <p>Every day, physicians are bombarded with patient
              pressure to prescribe antibiotics where there are no
              medical indications for their use. Physicians are
              sometimes pressured to issue medical reports to
              employers or insurance companies that support a
              particular patient's aspirations, but are
              inconsistent with the physician's professional
              opinion and judgment. In such circumstances, we
              encourage and expect physicians to make sound
              professional decisions based upon reliable evidence
              and sound judgment, rather than subordinating their
              judgment to the will of patients.</p>

              <p>We encourage and expect physicians to take the
              same approach with respect to requests for infant
              male circumcision. When physicians receive such
              requests, it is important that physicians take ample
              time to gain an understanding of the basis for the
              request, to provide accurate detailed information to
              parents about the potential benefits, risks and
              alternatives, and to gauge their understanding of
              that information.</p>

              <p>If parents persistently request circumcision of a
              newborn male infant after a thorough dialogue about
              benefits, risks and alternatives, a physician is not
              obligated to perform the procedure if he/she does not
              regard the procedure to be medically indicated and
              appropriate. Physicians can respectfully decline to
              perform this medical procedure just as they
              respectfully decline to prescribe medications that
              are not medically indicated and just as they decline
              to author medical opinions contrary to their best
              professional judgment.</p>

              <p>At the conclusion of my February 20th memo, I made
              reference to the unique circumstance where infant
              male circumcision is requested for religious rather
              than medical reasons. In such circumstances, there is
              a high probability that the procedure will be
              performed by someone other than a physician if the
              option is not made available through a physician.
              Some physicians are understandably inclined in that
              circumstance to accede to the request because they
              logically believe the procedure would be performed
              more safely by a physician than by a
              non-physician.</p>

              <p>The final sentence in my February 20th memo, which
              recommended consultation with the CMPA, pertained to
              circumstances in which a physician is confronted with
              a request for infant male circumcision based upon
              religious rather than medical reasons. Where
              physicians may be inclined to comply with such a
              request as the "lesser of two evils," even though it
              is contrary to his/her medical judgment, we would
              recommend that physicians obtain advice from the CMPA
              about appropriate documentation of the consent
              process so that it explicitly defines the conditions
              under which the procedure is performed.</p>

              <p><b>Obtaining informed consent for infant male
              circumcision</b></p>

              <p>Most physicians today understand that obtaining
              informed consent for any medical procedure is a
              process rather than simply obtaining the signature of
              a patient or guardian on a consent form.</p>

              <p>Obtaining informed consent for any procedure
              requires disclosure of all relevant benefits and
              risks of the anticipated procedure as well as
              alternatives to that procedure. While Canadian courts
              have stopped short of casting an obligation on
              physicians to ensure that all of the information is
              understood by the patient or guardian, a prudent
              physician will make a reasonable effort to achieve
              understanding of the information that is shared with
              patients/guardians.</p>

              <p>The surgical consent form used in some
              Saskatchewan Health Districts concludes with this
              certification statement that requires a physician's
              signature:</p>

              <blockquote>
                I hereby certify that I've explained the nature,
                effect, risks, and alternatives of the
                above-mentioned procedure(s) and in my opinion the
                above-named patient or guardian understands their
                nature and consequences.
              </blockquote>

              <p>To formulate and certify a professional opinion
              that a patient has understood the nature, effect,
              risks, and alternatives of a contemplated medical
              intervention requires much more than one-way
              disclosure of risks to the patient. It requires
              two-way dialogue through which the physician has
              reasonable potential to gauge the understanding held
              by the patient or guardian.</p>

              <p>Regrettably, the research evidence in respect to
              what primarily motivates parents to request infant
              male circumcision is not very encouraging. In a <a
              href="http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/abstract/80/2/215"
               target="_blank">study</a> published in
              <i>Pediatrics</i> (1987), Brown reported that the
              strongest factor considered by parents in a request
              for infant male circumcision is whether the father is
              circumcised.</p>

              <p>It is unfortunate to consider that surgery, which
              is not without risk, might be undertaken on an infant
              just to ensure that he "looks like his dad." Most
              physicians would consider it quite unethical to
              perform facial plastic surgery at the request of
              parents to make a child look more like his dad.
              However as a profession, we've often acquiesced to
              parental requests for circumcision based on nothing
              more substantive than this same logic.</p>

              <p><b>Medical Indications for Infant Male
              Circumcision</b></p>

              <p>On the basis of thorough review of the most recent
              medical literature, the Canadian Paediatric Society
              has concluded that the overall evidence of the
              benefits and harms of circumcision is so evenly
              balanced that it does not support recommending
              circumcision as a routine procedure far newborns.</p>

              <p>As early as <a
              href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap/#a1971"
               target="_blank">1971</a>, and again in <a
              href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap/#a1975"
               target="_blank">1975</a>, the American Academy of
              Pediatrics (AAP) took a stand against the routine
              circumcision of newborns on the basis that <i>there
              are no valid medical indications for circumcision in
              the neonatal period.</i> In <a
              href="/library/statements/cps1975/"
              target="_blank">1975</a>, <a
              href="/library/statements/cps2/"
              target="_blank">1982</a>, and again in <a
              href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm"
               target="_blank">1996</a> the Canadian Paediatric
              Society (CPS) reviewed the literature and reached the
              same conclusion.</p>

              <p><b>Complications of Infant Male
              Circumcision</b></p>

              <p>Infant male circumcision is often treated as a
              very minor procedure with virtually no risk of
              significant complications. That is frankly not
              true.</p>

              <p>Infant male circumcision may lead to complications
              that range from minor to severe. They include easily
              controllable bleeding, amputation of the glans, acute
              renal failure, life threatening sepsis and rarely
              death. Reported rates of such complications vary
              widely in the literature. In a <a
              href="/library/complications/williams-kapila/">study</a>
              reported in the <i>British Journal of Surgery</i>
              (1993) Williams and Kapila have suggested that
              complication rates range from 2% to 10%.</p>

              <p>The complaints committee of the College of
              Physicians and Surgeons has recently concluded its
              investigation of a tragic case in which routine
              infant male circumcision resulted in urinary tract
              obstruction, massive bladder distention, and
              compression of the inferior vena cava. The physician
              who carried out the circumcision believed the
              procedure had been performed uneventfully.</p>

              <p><b>What is the Risk for Physicians?</b></p>

              <p>At our suggestion, the <a
              href="http://www.cmpa.org/" target="_blank">Canadian
              Medical Protective Association</a> (CMPA) reviewed
              its closed legal claims pertaining to infant male
              circumcision between 1991 and 2002. There were twenty
              such lawsuits and the decisions were equally split
              between the plaintiffs and the respondent
              physicians.</p>

              <p>During the same timeframe, the CMPA gave
              assistance to physicians in respect of thirty-six
              circumcision related complaints to the Colleges of
              Physicians and Surgeons, half of those being related
              to newborns.</p>

              <p>Physicians might be tempted to take some solace
              from these data which suggest that College complaints
              and lawsuits related to infant male circumcision are
              relatively infrequent. However before becoming too
              complacent in the matter, we would recommend that
              physicians take heed of a profound rise in activity
              by citizen groups that very vigorously oppose infant
              male circumcision, and characterize it as unwarranted
              mutilating surgery.</p>

              <p>In many countries including Canada, these citizen
              groups are gaining a higher profile and more
              credibility among the general public. They are
              bringing to light new evidence that the male prepuce
              may play an important physiological and psychological
              role in adult male function, which has to date been
              largely ignored in any consideration of harm
              associated with infant male circumcision. As a
              consequence of the public awareness raised by these
              groups, a growing number of adult males and/or their
              parents are now expressing strong resentment against
              physicians who performed infant male circumcision
              many years ago at their request. The retroactive
              anger toward these physicians is generally based upon
              arguments that parents were given woefully inadequate
              information about potential adverse impact on adult
              male function, and inadequate information about
              normal infant penile development and hygiene.</p>

              <p>Whether this growing backlash against physicians
              does or does not generate lawsuits, it is certainly
              making life somewhat unpleasant for physicians who
              are perceived by their former patients as having been
              much too casual in their decision to perform infant
              male circumcision.</p>

              <p>While the College's primary mandate is public
              protection, we do encourage physicians to give
              careful thought to the downstream risks they may
              incur by taking an inappropriately casual approach to
              infant male circumcision driven exclusively by
              parental preference without valid medical indication
              for the procedure.</p>

              <p>If members do have any unresolved questions or
              concerns about this issue, we would be pleased to
              respond to individual requests for clarification.</p>
