                AHMA-Principles of Ethics:

____________________________________________________________


         1. Practitioners render service to humanity with
       full respect for the dignity of humankind, treating
       the total person: body, mind and spirit.  The
       treatment shall be at all times in the best interest
       of the patient.

          2. Practitioners continuously improve their skill
       and medical knowledge and make that skill and
       knowledge available to their patients.

          3. Practitioners recognize that patients have the
       right to share in making decisions pertaining to
       their treatment.  They guide and educate patients
       toward this goal and actively encourage them to share
       responsibility for their care.

          4. Practitioners may advertise where legal;
       however, such advertising should never promise
       improvement or cure or be self laudatory.

          5. Practitioners have the right to practice all
       responsible methods of treatment.  The practitioner
       has the obligation, however, to determine the
       effectiveness and safety of such treatments and to
       acquire the skills and training necessary for
       the delivery of such care.

          6. Practitioners do not reveal the confidences
       entrusted in the course of medical care unless
       required by law, or unless it becomes necessary to
       protect the welfare of the individual or the
       community.  Members should make provisions to
       donate some time to treatment of those without
       adequate financial resources on an individual or
       community basis.

   What We're About:

       The AHMA was founded in 1978 to unite physicians
       (M.D.s and D.O.s) who practice holistic medicine.
       Later, associate membership was expanded to include
       all state-licensed holistically oriented
       practitioners, such as chiropractors, naturopaths,
       nurses, psychologists, dentists, etc.  Students
       studying for these degrees are also eligible to be
       members.

       The mission of the AHMA is to support physicians in
       their evolving personal and professional development
       and to promote an art and science of health care
       which acknowledges all aspects of the individual, the
       family and the planet.

       Holistic Medicine is a philosophy of medical care
   that emphasizes personal responsibility and
       participation in one's own health care.  It
       encompasses all safe modalities of diagnosis and
       treatment while emphasizing the whole person -
       physical, mental, emotional and spiritual.
