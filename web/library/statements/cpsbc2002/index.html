      <p class="title">INFANT MALE CIRCUMCISION</p>

      <table cols="2" summary="">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top" width="40%">
            <p class="text1">The matter of routine infant male
            circumcision was a subject of discussion at a recent
            meeting of the College Council. The College has
            received repeated requests from special interest groups
            and individuals to "ban" this procedure. <span
            class="yellow">Their objections to routine infant male
            circumcision are based on a variety of factors
            including the <a
            href="/library/statements/cps1975/">lack of medical
            indications</a>, the <a
            href="/library/ethics/AAP/">right of the newborn to
            make its own long term decisions</a>, <a
            href="/library/complications/williams-kapila/">immediate
            risks</a>, <a href="/library/psych/boyle6/">long term
            effects</a>, <a
            href="/library/legal/Canada/court1/">ethical
            issues</a>, and so on.</span></p>

            <p class="text1">The College's position on routine
            infant male circumcision is that it is a matter of
            patients' (or parental) choice, which may be based on
            traditional, religious, cultural or personal
            preference. <span class="yellow">The issue of perceived
            medical necessity is, in the opinion of most experts,
            no longer pertinent</span>. Though some studies suggest
            slightly lower frequencies of urinary tract infection
            and decreases in HIV transmission in circumcised males,
            most physicians agree that the procedure should be
            regarded as a "cosmetic" procedure and in North America
            should be approached as such. Younger physicians
            (coming out of training programs) <span
            class="yellow">often do not have skill or experience in
            performing circumcisions</span> and also may have
            little interest in acquiring such skills or being
            involved in the procedure.</p>
          </td>

          <td valign="top" width="40%">
            <p class="text2">College Council did not identify any
            necessity to place restrictions on the availability of
            routine infant male circumcision, except to remind
            physicians that when performed routinely, this is a
            cosmetic surgical procedure which should only be
            considered after detailed discussion with the parents.
            This allows parental request and consent to be based on
            accurate and comprehensive information. Such
            discussions should include the fact that infant
            circumcision is not a medical necessity, that many
            experts including <a
            href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm"
             target="_blank">national pediatric associations do not
            recommend it</a>, that there are risks such as bleeding
            and infection which can be <a
            href="/news/thewestern08-31-02/">significant</a> in
            rare instances, and that currently the majority of male
            infants are not circumcised. Also, <span
            class="yellow">physicians should be aware that they are
            not required to accept the parents' request for routine
            circumcision if they are personally unable or unwilling
            to perform the procedure.</span> Such requests should
            be referred to others in those situations.</p>

            <p class="text2">It is Council's opinion that the
            requests for this procedure will decrease through the
            natural evolution of public and medical opinion. As a
            uniquely North American cultural trend in the absence
            of medical indications, (except for requests based upon
            religious beliefs) <span class="yellow">routine infant
            circumcision will likely become an uncommon
            procedure.</span></p>
