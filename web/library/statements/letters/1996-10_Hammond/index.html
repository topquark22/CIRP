Dear Editor,

      We invite physicians, particularly OB-GYNs to be introspective about
Dr. John C. Nelson's statement (Circumcision, AMN Oct 28): We cannot allow
females or any other group of patients to be mutilated."  It is inherently
mutilative when OB-GYNs excise the healthy, functional prepuce[1,2] from a
male newborn who cannot consent to this genital cutting.  Well-intending
adults may believe it's in the child's best interests, but intellectually
honest physicians know that alleged medical indications for routine infant
circumcision are weak, and that many parents are motivated by irrational
social fears or customs.

   What circumcising unconsenting male and female children share in common
is not severity, but sovereignty.  Every man, woman and child has inherent
human rights to physical integrity and self-determination.  According to
anti-FGM advocate, Dr. Nahid Toubia, "The unnecessary removal of a
functioning body organ in the name of tradition, custom or any other
non-disease related cause should never be acceptable to the health
profession.  All childhood circumcisions are violations of human rights,
and a breach of the fundamental code of medical ethics.  It is the moral
duty of educated professionals to protect the health and the rights of
those with little or no social power to protect themselves.[3]"

   We invite physicians to contact us about the hundreds of men we're
documenting who suffer the long-term physical, sexual and psychological
consequences[4] of a genital mutilating surgery they did not choose.  We
encourage them to acknowledge the many prophylaxis and treatment
alternatives that preserve the patients genital integrity, making infant
circumcision obsolete.  We urge physicians to take the lead in educating
themselves and the public on this issue, to cease acting as agents of
social custom, and to truly uphold their oath to "Do no harm."

In unity for the children,



Tim Hammond, Founder
