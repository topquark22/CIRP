    <title>AIDS organizations petition to AAP</title>

    <p><i>The following petition was sent to Robert E. Hannemann,
    Maurice E. Keenan, Joe M. Sanders, Jr., and William Oh, all of
    the AAP, on 16 October 1996. It was signed by 26 professional
    AIDS educators.</i></p>

    <p><i>This is an ongoing initiative. We are seeking help in
    signing up more AIDS professionals so that we can resubmit the
    petition to the AAP. See below for details if you are
    interested.</i></p>

    <h2>Petition to the Task Force on Circumcision<br />
    of the American Academy of Pediatrics</h2>

    <p>As people concerned with AIDS education and awareness, we
    would like to discourage the American Academy of Pediatrics
    from promoting routine circumcision as an AIDS prevention
    strategy. We do not consider routine circumcision to be a valid
    or effective measure to prevent HIV transmission.</p>

    <p>While some have claimed a link between circumcision status
    and HIV transmission, current research is inconclusive, with
    more studies reporting no relationship between circumcision
    status and HIV transmission. In many cases, research is flawed
    or the findings are within statistical margins of error.</p>

    <p>Portraying routine circumcision as an effective means of
    AIDS prevention distracts the public from the task of avoiding
    the behaviors proven to contribute to HIV transmission, and may
    (risks) create a false sense of security among circumcised men
    and their partners.</p>

    <p>We urge the Task Force on Circumcision to affirm that
    circumcision is not an effective AIDS prevention strategy.</p>
