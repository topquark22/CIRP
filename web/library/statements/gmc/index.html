      <p><b>CIRP note:</b> This file contains the draft guidance
      for doctors who are asked to circumcise male children that
      was approved in priciple by the General Medical Council of
      the United Kingdom (GMC) at the meeting held on 20-21 May
      1997. The GMC is the licensing and disciplinary body for the
      medical profession in the United Kingdom. This is an interim
      statement.</p>

      <p>We believe this Guidance is significant because it
      recognises:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>that there are enough troubling issues that there is a
        need to revisit the issue of child circumcision;</li>

        <li>that circumcision abridges the rights of the
        child;</li>

        <li>that the lawfulness of circumcision in criminal terms
        is unclear;</li>

        <li>the legitimacy of conscientious objector status for
        doctors who refuse to perform child circumcisions on
        ethical grounds;</li>

        <li>the need for appropriate attention to relief of
        pain.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The Guidance does not recognise:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>the <a href="/library/anatomy/">anatomy, structure and
        function of the foreskin</a> and its role in sexual
        sensitivity;</li>

        <li>that male and female infants have the same inherent
        human rights.</li>

    <h3>GENERAL MEDICAL COUNCIL, (U.K.), London, England, May
    1997.</h3>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <blockquote>
      <h1>GUIDANCE FOR DOCTORS WHO ARE ASKED TO CIRCUMCISE MALE
      CHILDREN</h1>

      <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

      <h3>Background</h3>

      <p>1. We decided to review the issues raised by male
      circumcision as a result of a number of complaints made to
      us. These concerned doctors who had not provided an
      acceptable standards of practice when performing the
      procedure. We had also received a number of letters
      questioning the ethics of the procedure and asking for our
      views on whether, and in what circumstances, the procedure
      was acceptable, for either religious or therapeutic
      reasons.</p>

      <p>2. Circumcision raises difficult questions about the
      rights and freedoms of individuals. Many maintain that
      individuals have a right to practise their religion
      unhindered; while others feel it is unequivocally wrong to
      undertake a surgical procedure, with its attendant risks, on
      an infant who is unable to consent. These are not primarily
      medical matters and we do not think they can be resolved by
      the medical profession alone. They are matters for society as
      a whole to decide. Nonetheless, we have a responsibility to
      protect patients and guide doctors, and we have therefore
      undertaken to provide guidance which sets out the principles
      of good medical practice for those doctors who are asked to
      perform circumcisions for religious or for medical
      reasons.</p>

      <p>3. In 1996 we invited views from religious organizations,
      anti-circumcision pressure groups, professional and patients'
      organisations, and civil rights and children's organisations
      on a preliminary draft of a guidance for doctors who are
      asked to perform male circumcision.</p>

      <h2>Consultation Exercises - summary of responses</h2>

      <h3>Rights and Freedoms</h3>

      <p>4. Male circumcision is considered by many in the Jewish
      and Islamic faiths to be essential to the practice of their
      religion; they would regard any restriction or ban on male
      circumcision as an infringement of a fundamental human right.
      Some respondents argued that if doctors could not carry out
      the procedure, parents would turn in greater numbers to
      individuals who lacked the skills and the experience to
      perform it safely and competently.</p>

      <p>5. Some replies, including many from civil rights and
      children's representative organisations, acknowledged the
      difficulty in achieving a balance between the rights of the
      child and the rights of individuals to practise their
      religion. However, they strongly believed that, because
      circumcision for non-therapeutic reasons carries risks, it is
      wrong to perform the operation on children who were not old
      enough to give informed consent. This belief was shared by
      Norm UK, and others who campaign for a ban on male
      circumcision in the UK.</p>

      <p>6. Many civil rights and children's organisations referred
      to the <i><a href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">UN
      Convention on the Rights of the Child</a></i> (ratified by
      the UK Government in 1991). They placed most emphasis on
      Article 24.3 which states that ratifying states should `take
      all effective and appropriate measures with a view to
      abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health of
      children'. However, this should be balanced against Article
      9.2 of the <a
      href="http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/5e.htm">European
      Convention for the Protection of Human Rights</a>, which
      protects the rights of individuals to practise their
      religion.</p>

      <p>7. The Law Commission has undertaken a consultation
      exercise on consent in the criminal law (ending 31.1.97); a
      short section of the Law Commission's report argues that male
      circumcision is lawful in the UK. One respondent told us that
      the Law Commission's opinions on this point have been
      challenged. However, all this legislation is untested in the
      context of circumcision. The legal position therefore remains
      unclear.</p>

      <h3>Views about harm and benefit</h3>

      <p>8. Many replies suggest that the medical profession has a
      duty to provide the public with objective information about
      circumcision; and that doctors should be obliged to provide
      counseling to parents before, and after circumcising their
      child. Others thought that doctors should not put undue
      emphasis on the risks of the procedure, because there was
      insufficient evidence to justify worrying the parents about
      it. However, a considerable number of respondents held the
      view that because circumcision has very few medical benefits,
      and the potential dangers to the child outweighed these,
      circumcision is inappropriate under any circumstances. A
      number of these respondents, some of whom had been
      circumcised as infants and who as adults, believed they had
      been seriously damaged by the procedure, felt strongly that
      circumcision should be made unlawful.</p>

      <p>9. Others who wrote to us offered constructive advice on
      the text of our guidance as well as commenting on the wider
      issues. Many expressed concern about the welfare of infants
      who are circumcised for religious or cultural reasons by
      people who do not have appropriate level of medical knowledge
      and skill. Some asked that guidance be introduced which
      obliged doctors to undertake the procedure in hygienic
      conditions, with appropriate pain relief and aftercare.</p>

      <h3>In conclusion</h3>

      <p>10. We are very grateful to everyone who took the time and
      trouble to send us their views. As shown above, many of the
      respondents held conflicting views. In drafting our guidance
      for doctors we have considered, as objectively as possible,
      all of the views and information put to us. Our aim is to
      provide guidance which will help doctors to provide a good
      standard of care for their patients.</p>

      <p>11. Our published guidance does not specifically address
      the rights of children. However, many of the principles set
      forth in our booklet <a
      href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/standards/good.htm"
      target="_blank"><i>Good medical practice</i></a> are of broad
      application and should be followed by doctors when they are
      asked to perform circumcisions. The guidance which follows is
      based on the principles in this booklet.</p>

      <h2>Standards of practice for doctors asked to circumcise
      male children</h2>

      <p>If you decide to circumcise a male child you must:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Have the necessary skills and experience both to
        perform the operation and to reduce the pain and discomfort
        of the patient</li>

        <li>Keep up to date with developments in the practice of
        male circumcision including when the procedure is, and is
        not, necessary for medical reasons</li>

        <li>Explain objectively to those with parental
        responsibility for the child any benefits or risks of the
        procedure, taking into account the age of the child</li>

        <li>Explain to those with parental responsibility that they
        may invite their religious adviser to be present at the
        circumcision to give advice on how the procedure should be
        performed to meet the requirements of their faith</li>

        <li>Listen to those with parental responsibility and give
        careful consideration to their views. You are not obliged
        to act on a request to circumcise a child, but you should
        explain if you are opposed to circumcision other than for
        therapeutic reasons. You should also tell those with
        parental responsibility that they have a right to see
        another doctor</li>

        <li>Obtain the permission of both parents whenever
        possible, but in all cases obtain valid consent, in
        writing, from a person with parental responsibility before
        performing the procedure</li>

        <li>Provide appropriate after care.</li>
      </ul>
