Letters
<P>
Dear Editor
<P>
Whilst Lotte Newman may enthusiastically endorse the GMC's guidelines
on circumcision, I did not and will not, unless the advice is preceded
by paragraphs of explanation.
<P>
The medical profession has become involved in circumcision through
benevolence and good faith. However, now that evidence is accumulating
that it is not a harmless procedure, it is right and proper that we
should question medical involvement and signal a view that we are less
than happy with being asked to be the instrument of a faith (or state
for that matter) against the interests of an individual.
<P>
Whilst it would be unrealistic to expect all medical involvement in
ritual circumcision to stop overnight, we should not hide the facts
from people and should instead encourage debate.
<P>
The preamble to this guidance should reflect this concern, encourage
debate, and signal a determination to review our involvement in the
light of developments."
<P>
Dr. Richard Colman<BR>
GMC member, York [UK]
