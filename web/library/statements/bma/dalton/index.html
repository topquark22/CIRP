Dear Professor Horner,<P>

<B>GUIDANCE ON MALE CIRCUMCISION</B><P>

Thank for forwarding a copy of the BMA'S revised guidance on male
circumcision.  It is disappointing that I was promised in August
that this would be supplied to me when issued, but it was issued
in September and only forwarded after a reminder.
<P>
The guidance has clearly taken on board representations received
and has much to commend it.  In particular your statement ``...to
circumcise for therapeutic reasons where medical research has
shown other techniques to be at least as effective and less
invasive would be unethical and inappropriate'' is clear,
unequivocal and should virtually stop circumcision on the
pretence of medical need.
<P>
The guidance does however have some errors and shortcomings and
appears inconsistent with a statement in Medical Ethics Today:
``In the BMA's view, irreversible treatments of questionable
necessity carried out on people who cannot give valid consent,
must be subject to review by the courts...''  The guidance would
also seem to be misleading your members as regards the legality
of the practice and leaving them open to future litigation as the
harm caused by circumcision is increasingly recognised.
<P>
My comments on the document are enclosed.
<P>
Yours sincerely
<P>

<B>COMMENTS ON BMA GUIDANCE ON CIRCUMCISION OF MALE INFANTS</B>
<P>
<B>General Comments</B>
<P>
It is disappointing that the guidance provides only one reference
to the medical literature and that was a non-peer reviewed letter
from an American advocate of circumcision.
<P>
The document contains no guidance on record keeping.
<P>
The guidance contains no requirement for followup of a
circumcised infant into adult life to ensure that any
complications, including any sexual dysfunction, are identified
and properly treated.  A central registry of such complications
would enable the safety, or otherwise, of circumcision to be
properly assessed.  It would also allow definitive assessment of
claimed health benefits.
<P>
<B>Introductory Text</B>
<P>
You state ``The subject should not be confused with female
`circumcision' which was outlawed by the 1985 Prohibition of
Female Circumcision Act...''  The ethics of ablating healthy
tissue from healthy unconsenting children are independent of
gender.  Any confusion arises from deeming ablation of genital
tissue from children of one gender to be more acceptable than in
the case of the other gender.  Why should the foreskin of a boy
be treated with any less respect than the clitoral hood of a
girl?
<P>
<B>Circumcision for medical purposes</B>
<P>
The statement ``to circumcise for therapeutic reasons where
medical research has shown other techniques to be at least as
effective and less invasive would be unethical and inappropriate'' 
 
is a clear statement that conservative treatment should be
favoured over circumcision.  To help doctors keep up to date with
developments in medical practice it would have been helpful to
provide references to the many studies in the medical literature
showing that circumcision is not necessary for foreskin
problems-.  This would carry more weight than the bland
statement ``It is rarely necessary to circumcise an infant for
medical reasons.''  Intervention is often unnecessary and in other
cases conservative treatments are safe and effective.
<P>
You say ``Doctors must be allowed to make clinical judgements in
individual cases, based on the above, as to the treatment to be
used.  The BMA would therefore have concerns at any prohibition
of the use of techniques which, in certain circumstances are
considered by the profession at large to be clinically
appropriate.''  This appears to place doctors' 
 ``clinical freedom''
above the patient's right to give or withhold consent to
treatment on the basis of full information.  I suggest rewording
as follows:  ``Where a doctor considers that circumcision is the
form of treatment in the best interests of the patient, he must
explain his reasons to the person with legal authority to
consent.  He must still explain the alternatives available and
the risks and benefits of all the treatment options.  His
justification for the proposed treatment must be recorded in the
patient's notes.''
<P>
<B>Circumcision for religious or cultural reasons</B>
<P>
<B>Legality</B>
<P>
In support of your assertion that ``male circumcision is lawful
under English common law,''  you cite the case of R v Brown, in
which Lord Templeman states ``Ritual circumcision, tattooing,
ear-piercing and violent sports including boxing are lawful
activities.'' Note that this is, in legal terms, <I>obiter</I>.  It is
a statement of opinion by a judge and therefore not of binding
authority.  

Templeman defines as lawful ``Other activities carried on with
consent by or on behalf of the injured person have been accepted
as lawful not withstanding that they involve actual bodily harm
or may cause serious bodily harm.''  Note that infant circumcision
does not have the consent of the injured person.  Ablation of
healthy tissue from any other part of a child's body in the
absence of medical need would d likely constitute actual, or even
grievous, bodily harm.  It therefore seems that circumcision of
male infants in an offence under the Offences Against the Person
Act 1861, even though no prosecution has yet been brought to
date.

Section 1(1) <A HREF="http://www.butterworths.co.uk/academic/fortin/statutes/cypa33.htm">Children and Young Persons Act 1933</A>, requires that
``person who wilfully assaults a child or causes or procures him
to be assaulted...in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary
suffering or injury to health shall commit an offence'' 
. 
Circumcision would appear to constitute an offence under this act
since it damages health by removing specialised tissue.
<P>
<B>The duty to balance potential benefit and harm</B>
<P>
You say ``With all procedures, professionals have an ethical
obligation to weigh the potential benefits and harms of the
procedure and explain these in an appropriate manner to the
patient or person consenting on the patient's behalf.''  Rather
than suggest that ``Doctors unfamiliar with the practice and who
receive a request for circumcision may find it helpful to seek
advice about the physical risks of the procedure from doctors
experienced in conducting circumcisions,'' it would have been
helpful to enclose a list of the risks of the procedure to be
explained to the he parents before they may be deemed to give
appropriate consent.  I attach a consent form adapted from one
compiled by American paediatrician Robert Van Howe which presents
a comprehensive list of the potential benefits and complications
of circumcision and which should be included in the guidance. 
Given the non-therapeutic nature of the procedure, it is
particularly important that the parents be made aware that there
are intrinsic risks of circumcision and no proven benefits.
<P>
You say ``the BMA does not have a policy on the ethics of male
circumcision for religious or cultural purposes...''  This is a
cop out.  Given the statement ``...to circumcise for therapeutic
reasons where medical research has shown other techniques to be
at least as effective and less invasive would be unethical and
inappropriate,'' it seems difficult to see how it can be ethical
to circumcise a child who has no disease and therefore requires
no treatment.
<P>
<B>Potential health benefits</B>
<P>
You say ``... the health, as opposed to the social, benefits of
circumcision are increasingly
disputed'' and yet cite a non-peer reviewed letter by an American
Advocate of circumcision without presenting any of the evidence
which leads such claims to be disputed.  This brings your
association into disrepute.  
<P>
The statement ``In some circumstances, a doctor may think it
better to do the circumcision...if he or she feels the child is
at risk of being circumcised in unhygienic or otherwise unsafe
conditions'' denies that the circumcision is itself harmful.
<P>
<B>Consent</B>
<P>
A parent's right to give proxy consent to medical treatment on
behalf of a child is lost if it is exercised against the best
interests of the child.  A circumcision carried out with parental
consent might therefore be deemed unauthorised and therefore
unlawful.
<P>
You cite a case raised with the BMA which concerned a GP who
circumcised a baby unknown to him but whose parents were
unmarried and estranged.  What outcome arose from the mother's
complaint?
<P>
<B>Charging patients</B>
<P>
I suspect that it would not in fact be the ``patient'' but his
parents that would be charged in this case.   This section could
better advise that first, the taxpayer cannot be expected to pay
for the costs of medically unnecessary mutilations or of treating
the complications thereof, and, second, that doctors should not
be allowed to benefit financially from such procedures. 
<P>
<B>Legal Issues</B>
<P>
You state ``Poorly performed circumcisions hold legal implications
for the doctor responsible.  An action could be brought against
a doctor responsible on the child's behalf if the circumcision
was carried out negligently.''  It seems worthy of consideration
that the rate of complications from circumcision is very high. 
Even if the 2% to 10% of circumcisions resulting in complications
are not deemed to have done so due to ``negligence" they could be
the subject of complaints. It would seem that the risk of doing
circumcisions is so great that doctors should be advised against
performing them altogether.  I have been advised by a barrister
that a man could issue legal proceedings against a doctor in
respect of  his  ``successful'' circumcision if he could show that
the parents had not been given enough information on the risks
and harm for consent to be valid.
<P>
The guidance goes on to say ``Alternatively, the child could issue
such proceedings in his own name on reaching the age of 18 and
the normal time limit for starting legal proceedings would run
from that birthday.''  It is not clear how such action could be
brought if no records enable the patient to trace the
circumciser.  The guidance should state that doctors performing
infant circumcisions must be in communication with the infant's
GP and that full records must be kept on the patient's notes for
at least 21 years from the date of the entry.
<P>
You claim ``...because circumcision is not an unlawful procedure,
action could not be taken against a doctor simply because a man
was unhappy at having been circumcised at all.''  The undisputable
existence of men who feel this way should however be respected
by doctors.  This is very good reason for unequivocal ethical
guidance that doctors must not perform circumcisions in the
absence of defensible medical indications.
<P>
<B>Conscientious objection</B>
<P>
You state ``...doctors should not delay in explaining to the
patient their own moral position but not seek to impose their own
moral viewpoint on patients who do not share it.''  It is
important, however, that a doctor takes action to protect a child
where he feels that the child may be harmed by the actions of the
parents or, worse still, a medical colleague.
