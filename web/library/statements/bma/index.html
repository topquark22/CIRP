      <h2>Circumcision of Male Infants: Guidance for Doctors</h2>

      <p>There has been much debate on the ethics of circumcising
      baby boys, and this guideline outlines the position of the
      BMA, with regard to circumcision for medical purposes, and
      the issues doctors should take into account when asked to
      perform circumcision for religious or cultural reasons. The
      subject should not be confused with female "circumcision"
      which was outlawed by the 1985 Prohibition of Female
      Circumcision Act. This issue is addressed by a separate <a
      href="http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/FGM"
      target="_blank">BMA Guidance</a>.</p>

      <h3>Circumcision for medical purposes</h3>

      <p>These guidelines do not attempt to offer detailed guidance
      as to the appropriateness of accepted therapeutic clinical
      procedures. Their aim is to offer guidance on the ethical
      duty of doctors to treat patients appropriately, and to keep
      themselves educated and aware of developments in clinical
      practice.</p>

      <p>This advice applies to all aspects of practice, including
      circumcision, and can be outlined as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Where conditions can effectively be treated
        conservatively, it is accepted good practice to do so. Even
        limited procedures should only be carried out where there
        is good reason, and then only after adequate conservative
        treatment. The BMA opposes unnecessarily invasive
        procedures being used where alternative, less invasive
        techniques, are equally efficient and available.</li>

        <li>Doctors have a duty to keep up to date with
        developments in medical practice. Therefore, to circumcise
        for therapeutic reasons where medical research has shown
        other techniques to be at least as effective and less
        invasive would be unethical and inappropriate.</li>

        <li>Doctors must be allowed to make clinical judgements in
        individual cases, based on the above, as to the treatment
        to be used. The BMA would therefore have concerns at any
        prohibition of the use of techniques which, in certain
        circumstances are considered by the profession at large to
        be clinically appropriate.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It is rarely necessary to circumcise an infant for medical
      reasons. Doctors must recognise that the appearance of the
      foreskin in infancy does not act as a guide to whether it
      will become retractile in later life. <a
      href="/library/normal/">Normal anatomical and physiological
      characteristics of the infant foreskin</a> can be
      misinterpreted as being abnormal, and doctors should be
      familiar with recognising this and reassure parents
      accordingly.</p>

      <h3>Circumcision for religious or cultural reasons</h3>

      <p>This guideline only addresses the position of doctors
      performing ritual circumcisions, and not religious or
      cultural leaders.</p>

      <h3>Legality</h3>

      <p>Male circumcision is lawful under English common law. In
      the case of R v Brown [1993] 2 All ER 75 HL, Lord Templeman
      talks about the circumstances in which violence is not
      punishable under the criminal law.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"Even when violence is intentionally afflicted and
        results in serious bodily harm the accused is entitled to
        be acquitted if the injury was a foreseen incident of a
        lawful activity in which the person injured was
        participating. Surgery involves intentional violence
        resulting in serious bodily harm but surgery is a lawful
        activity. Other activities carried on with consent by or on
        behalf of the injured person have been accepted as lawful
        not withstanding that they involve actual bodily harm or
        may cause serious bodily harm. Ritual circumcision,
        tattooing, ear-piercing and violent sports including boxing
        are lawful activities."</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Circumcision, in common with ear piercing and cosmetic
      surgery, has never been the subject of a case in English law,
      but this assumption of lawfulness has never been
      challenged.</p>

      <p><b><font color="navy">[CIRP Note: This was written in
      1996, prior to the passage of the <a
      href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm#aofs"
      target="_blank">Human Rights Act 1998</a>. The lawfulness of
      child circumcision is now less clear. See for more
      information see <a href="/library/legal/BMA-human-rights/"
      target="_blank"><i>The Impact of the Human Rights Act 1998 on
      Medical Decision Making</i></a>.]</font></b></p>

      <p><b><font color="navy">[CIRP Note: When this passage was
      written in 1996 no case had considered circumcision. Since
      that time the case of <i>Re J</i> has been decided. Doctors
      should be aware of the implications of this case on the
      practice of male circumcision of minors in the
      U.K.]</font></b></p>

      <h3>The duty to balance potential benefit and harm</h3>

      <p>With all procedures, professionals have an ethical
      obligation to weigh the potential benefits and harms of the
      procedure and explain these in an appropriate manner to the
      patient or person consenting on the patient's behalf Doctors
      unfamiliar with the practice and who receive a request for
      circumcision may find it helpful to seek advice about the
      physical risks of the procedure from doctors experienced in
      conducting circumcisions. Paediatric surgeons and urologists
      are trained in circumcision.</p>

      <p>The BMA does not have a policy on the ethics of male
      circumcision for religious or cultural purposes but issues
      this guidance in response to doctors for all relevant factors
      to be taken into account. The practice of circumcision has
      previously been considered to be morally neutral, that is, no
      harm was caused to the child and therefore with appropriate
      consent from both parents or a person lawfully exercising
      parental responsibility, it could be carried out. The
      neutrality of the procedure, however is now being
      increasingly challenged although it is argued that it is in
      the best interest of the child to be circumcised, to be
      accepted into a religion or community. Arguably the procedure
      can confer social benefits in some such circumstances.</p>

      <h3>Potential health benefits</h3>

      <p>However, the health, as opposed to the social, benefits of
      circumcision are increasingly disputed. It is clear that
      there is no consensus amongst the profession as to whether
      circumcision does carry benefits to health sufficiently large
      to justify the procedure. Arguments in favour of circumcision
      cite reduced infection rates and hygiene. It is claimed that
      it is protective against penile cancer, reducing the
      incidence by a factor of 5000.[1] Arguments against
      circumcision usually stress the damage caused to the penis
      from the operation, including scarring and a lack of
      sensation. In addition, poorly performed circumcision can
      give rise to infection and distress.</p>

      <p>It has also been argued that male circumcision may confer
      some health benefits to female sexual partners. However, this
      view has been challenged, together with the validity of the
      research on which it was based, and there is no consensus on
      this issue at present.</p>

      <p>Whatever the health implications of circumcision, the main
      impetus for circumcising comes from culture and religion, not
      from medical or scientific evidence.</p>

      <p>Where such a lack of consensus exists, the position of
      doctors is unclear. Individual doctors approached by patients
      requesting circumcision for their son must counsel the
      parents about the implications of the procedure, including
      the health risks involved. Any surgical procedure, including
      one of a minor nature, carries with it risks and parents must
      be made aware of these in order to give valid consent to the
      operation. In addition, doctors usually consider appropriate
      anesthesia a requirement and this also carries an element of
      risk.</p>

      <p>Doctors must use their judgement as to whether or not to
      perform circumcisions. In some circumstances, a doctor may
      think it better to do the circumcision, or refer the child to
      a plastic surgeon, if he or she feels the child is at risk of
      being circumcised in unhygienic or otherwise unsafe
      conditions.</p>

      <h3>Consent</h3>

      <p>The BMA strongly recommends that either the written
      consent of BOTH parents, or of the person with parental
      responsibility be obtained for circumcision. Parents must be
      aware of the nature and implications of the procedure, and
      the risks involved.</p>

      <p>Doctors should be aware of potential difficulties if both
      parents do not follow the same cultural tradition. A case
      raised with the BMA concerned a GP who circumcised, without
      any enquiry, a baby unknown to him but whose parents were, in
      fact, unmarried and estranged. The child's father had taken
      the baby without the mother's permission, fully aware that
      the procedure would be completely contrary to her wishes and
      that he had no legal right to consent. The mother made a
      formal complaint about the doctor concerned.</p>

      <p><font color="navy"><b>[CIRP Note: The <a
      href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/" target="_blank">General Medical
      Council</a> subsequently has issued a detailed Guidance on
      Consent. See for more information see <a
      href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/library/consent.asp#children"
       target="_blank"><i>Seeking patients' consent: the ethical
      considerations</i></a>, especially parts
      23-26.]</b></font></p>

      <h3>Expertise</h3>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/"
      target="_blank">General Medical Council</a> has no policy on
      the ethics of circumcision.</p>

      <p>However, the Council would take action of a doctor were
      performing such operations incompetently. One doctor, who
      carried out a number of circumcisions that resulted in
      several boys being admitted to hospital in the period from
      1991 to 1993, was found guilty of serious professional
      misconduct. Therefore doctors are advised not to undertake
      the procedure unless confident of their expertise but may
      refer the family to another competent practitioner.</p>

      <p>Doctors commonly facing requests for circumcision will
      find it helpful to establish whether there are colleagues in
      their area expert in this field. Religious and cultural
      groups may have organisations, locally or nationally, who
      give advice and can suggest practitioners who perform
      circumcisions. For example, the Initiation Society, the
      professional body for the organisation of (Jewish)
      Circumcision Pratitioners sets professional standards and
      keeps a list of registered practitioners. Other religious
      groups may have similar national or local registers.</p>

      <h3>Charging patients</h3>

      <p>Some doctors have been willing to provide circumcision
      routinely on demand. While there is no duty upon doctors or
      hospitals to do so, some will do this procedure without
      charge rather than risk the procedure being carried out in
      unhygienic conditions.</p>

      <h3>Legal Issues</h3>

      <p>Circumcision, as any other surgical procedure, should
      never be carried out by a doctor not trained in that
      particular operation. Normally, that doctor would be a
      pediatric surgeon, a urologist, or other doctor experienced
      in performing the operation.</p>

      <p>Poorly performed circumcisions hold legal implications for
      the doctor responsible. An action could be brought against a
      doctor responsible on the child's behalf if the circumcision
      was carried out negligently. Alternatively, the child could
      issue such proceedings in his own name on reaching the age of
      18 and the normal time limit for starting legal proceedings
      would run from that birthday. However, because circumcision
      is not an unlawful procedure, action could not be taken
      against a doctor simply because a man was unhappy at having
      been circumcised at all. A valid consent from a person
      authorised to give it on the patient's behalf is sufficient
      in such cases.</p>

      <h3>Conscientious objection</h3>

      <p>Some doctors may wish to not perform circumcisions for
      reasons of conscience. In such situations, both the BMA and
      GMC make clear that doctors should not delay in explaining to
      the patient their own moral position but not seek to impose
      their own moral viewpoint on patients who do not share it.
      The provision of factual information is a different matter
      and doctors can also explain the background to their
      conscientious objection if the child's parents require them
      to do so.</p>

      <p>In summary</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Circumcision is not unlawful, but care must be taken to
        obtain appropriate consent from the parent(s) and inform
        them of the implications, as with any surgical
        procedure.</li>

        <li>Circumcision for medical purposes should be carried out
        in accordance with accepted good clinical practice.</li>

        <li>Doctors must consider the situation of each case with
        which they are presented, and act according to their
        clinical judgement.</li>

        <li>It is recommended that written parental consent be
        obtained.</li>
