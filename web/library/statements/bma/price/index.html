    <h3>Christopher P Price, M.A. (Oxon). Letter to Stuart Horner,
    British Medical Association. (1996)</h3>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Prof. Stuart Horner<br />
       Chairman, Medical Ethics Committee<br />
       British Medical Association<br />
       BMA House<br />
       Tavistock Square<br />
       London WC1H 9JP</p>

      <p>Dear Professor Horner:</p>

      <p><b>Circumcision of Male Infants: Guidance for
      Doctors.</b></p>

      <p>I have just seen this <a
      href="/library/statements/bma/"><i>Guidance</i></a>, which
      for the most part is, in my opinion as a lawyer, dangerously
      flawed, misleading and one-sided.</p>

      <p>I have no real problem with the first section (much of
      which deserves commendation) dealing with circumcision for
      medical purposes, except that the point should properly have
      been made that current work, e.g that of <a
      href="/library/general/gordon/">Gordon and Collin</a>,<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> indicates that far too many
      circumcisions are being performed under the guise of
      necessary treatment than could properly be justified by
      proper and informed clinical judgement. Further, I can make
      little sense of the paragraph:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Doctors must be allowed to make clinical judgements in
        individual cases, based on the above, as to the treatment
        to be used. The BMA would therefore have concerns at any
        prohibition of the use of techniques which, in certain
        circumstances are considered by the profession at large to
        be clinically appropriate.
      </blockquote>

      <p>I am not aware of anyone who would seek a prohibition of
      male circumcision where this is medically imperative; rather,
      as the Guidance itself makes clear, less invasive treatments
      must be considered and used where effective. Perhaps the
      misapprehension here is founded in part on the considerable
      misapprehensions as to the harm of all circumcisions, the
      legal considerations and the lack of any medical benefits of
      non-therapeutic circumcisions which render the remainder of
      the Guidance so inept.</p>

      <p>The remainder of the <i>Guidance</i> deals with
      circumcisions for &ldquo;religious and cultural reasons&rdquo; (which I
      prefer to describe as an example of non-therapeutic
      circumcisions). The <i>Guidance</i> fails to deal adequately
      with the physical aspects of circumcision: not only does it
      fail to adhere to its own advice that doctors should &ldquo;keep
      up to date with developments in medical practice,&rdquo; it also
      quotes (as the sole reference) a letter from a US doctor
      whose bias in favour of routine circumcision is notorious,
      and whose writing ignores, as does the Guidance, the
      considerable body of medical literature refuting his claims.
      Thus, the American Cancer Society (&ldquo;ACS&rdquo;) has written to
      the American Academy of Pediatrics as follows:</p>

      <blockquote>
        ...[W]e would like to discourage the American Academy of
        Pediatrics from promoting routine circumcision as a
        preventative measure for penile and cervical cancer.
        Research suggesting a pattern in the circumcision status of
        partners of women with cervical cancer is methodologically
        flawed, outdated, and has not been taken seriously in the
        medical community for decades. Penile cancer rates in
        countries which do not practice circumcision are lower than
        those found in the United States. Fatalities caused by
        circumcision accidents may approximate the mortality rate
        from penile cancer.<br />
        <br />
      </blockquote>

      <p>Thus the claim for a reduction of penile cancer is
      untenable; and that for protection against cervical cancer
      (which presumably is what is meant by &ldquo;It has also been
      argued that male circumcision may confer some health benefits
      to female sexual partners.&rdquo;) has rightly been described by
      the ACS as having &ldquo;not been taken seriously in the medical
      community for decades.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>The references to the harm of circumcision are wholly
      inadequate, and again reflect an ignorance of medical
      knowledge. That there is a loss of sensitivity was written
      about as long ago as the 12th century, when Maimonides wrote
      in his <i>Guide to the Perplexed</i>:</p>

      <blockquote>
        As regards circumcision, I think that one of its objects is
        to limit sexual intercourse, and to weaken the organ of
        generation as far as possible, and thus cause man to be
        moderate. Some people believe that circumcision is to
        remove a defect in man's formation; but every one can
        easily reply: How can products of nature be deficient so as
        to require external completion, especially as the use of
        the fore-skin to that organ is evident? This commandment
        has not been enjoined as a complement to a deficient
        physical creation, but as a means for perfecting man's
        moral shortcomings. The bodily injury caused to that organ
        is exactly that which is desired; it does not interrupt any
        vital function, nor does it destroy the power of
        generation. Circumcision simply counteracts excessive lust;
        for there is no doubt that circumcision weakens the power
        of sexual excitement, and sometimes lessens the natural
        enjoyment.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Reference ought also been made, inter alia, to a
      <i>Lancet</i> article from 1953, which shows that the damage
      to penile function has been well-known for a long
      time.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> More recently there has
      been the work of <a href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">Taylor,
      Lockwood and Taylor</a> and the references there
      cited.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p>The <i>Guidance</i> is wholly misleading as to the legal
      position. There is considerable doubt as to the legality of
      non-therapeutic circumcisions; and the Guidance wholly
      ignores the real problems of the circumstances when parents
      may lawfully consent to procedures being carried out on their
      children.</p>

      <p>The basic proposition in law is that a person's body is
      inviolate. Whilst one can consent to a degree of assault, the
      basic rule is that consent is not a defence to an assault
      inflicting actual bodily harm (see <a
      href="/library/legal/UKlaw/rvbrown1993/"><i>R v.
      Brown</i></a>, cited in the Guidance; see also Collins v.
      Wilcock where Robert Goff LJ said: &ldquo;the fundamental
      principle, plain and incontestable, is that every person's
      body is inviolate. It has long been established that any
      touching of another person, however slight, may amount to a
      battery.&rdquo;). Consent will however be a defence to injury
      inflicted during medical treatment with consent.</p>
      Whilst Lord Templeman did make the remark in <i>R v.
      Brown</i> quoted in the Guidance, it is clearly
      <i>obiter</i>; and none of the other Law Lords followed him.
      I have no doubt that the toleration accorded to routine
      circumcision stems from (given that English law does not
      demand professional qualifications for the performance of
      surgery) the exemption accorded to medical treatment in
      general, and is not a free-standing exemption in its own
      right.<br />
      <br />
       

      <p>Further, even if it had once enjoyed (and I firmly doubt
      that) an exemption in its own right, it does not follow that
      it still does; in just the same way that duelling, once
      tolerated, became unlawful.</p>

      <p>Poulter says:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Although there are no precedents in this field to rely on
        there would appear to be three possible grounds upon which
        a defence of lawfulness might succeed at common law. The
        first is that the procedure is therapeutic. If this can be
        established a parent can validly consent to it on behalf of
        a child who is too young to understand what is being done.
        It would appear unlikely that this line of defence could
        generally succeed other than in comparatively rare
        instances of physical defect or abnormality. Second,
        although the matter is not entirely free from doubt, it
        seems that a parent may equally validly authorise a
        non-therapeutic operation, provided it is not actively
        against his child's interests. This would appear to have
        been the basis upon which the vast majority of male infants
        have been circumcised in this country with impunity from
        time immemorial. There is no need under this heading for
        the parent to establish that the operation is positively
        beneficial for the child, merely that he was acting
        reasonably in authorising it. Third, it has been
        tentatively suggested that a parent may even authorise
        something that is against his child's interests if it is
        compensated by sufficient advantage to others and is not
        seriously detrimental to the child. This exception is
        particularly apposite for establishing the legitimacy of
        transplant operations which directly benefit patients in
        pressing need (e.g. a brother or sister). It seems
        extremely unlikely that it could justify the more remote
        and controversial benefit of satisfying a deeply-felt
        community attachment to traditional customs. Moreover, to
        the extent that female circumcision, excision and
        infibulation are in fact mutilations and hence seriously
        detrimental to the child the defence would be ruled out in
        any case.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Given that, at the least, it is incontestable from the
      medical studies that circumcision is &ldquo;actively against [the
      child's] interests&rdquo; then the two possible defences he gives
      for non-therapeutic circumcisions fail; note also his
      comments on circumcisions for cultural reasons. Poulter's
      view as to male circumcision is flawed however by a failure
      to appreciate the physical pain, risks and inevitable harm
      that flow from it.</p>

      <p>If my analysis is correct then any person who circumcises
      for non-therapeutic reasons (and thus outside the scope of
      the &ldquo;medical exemption&rdquo; as to the infliction of injury)
      would be committing a criminal offence: and in view of the
      well-known and severe damage to normal penile function it
      would be appropriate to charge the graver offence under
      section 18 <a href="/library/legal/UKlaw/oap1861/">Offences
      Against the Person Act 1861</a>, for which a substantial term
      of imprisonment could be expected on conviction.</p>

      <p>The <i>Guidance</i> is wholly silent on the circumstances
      when parents might lawfully give consent to procedures on
      their child. Section 1(1) <a
      href="http://www.swarb.co.uk/acts/1933CaYPAct.shtml"
      target="_blank">Children and Young Persons Act</a> 1933,
      provided that a person who &lsquo;&lsquo;wilfully assaults&rdquo;
      a child or &lsquo;&lsquo;causes or procures him to be
      assaulted...in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary
      suffering or injury to health&rdquo; (emphasis added) shall commit
      an offence. <a
      href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/ca198986/"
      target="_blank">Children Act 1989</a> Section 1(1) provides:
      &ldquo;When a court determines any question with respect to(a) the
      upbringing of a child, the child's welfare shall be the
      court's paramount consideration], the child's welfare was the
      court's paramount consideration.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>The paramouncy of the welfare of the child was made clear
      in <a
      href="http://www.hrcr.org/safrica/childrens_rights/Gillick_WestNorfolk.htm">
      <i>Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health
      Authority</i></a>;<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> even in <i>S
      v. S, W v. Official Solicitor</i>,<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> adopting a lower test, it was clear
      that that parents can give valid consent only to treatments
      which are not &ldquo;against the interests of the child.&rdquo;</p>
      The inability of parents to give legally valid &ldquo;consent&rdquo; to
      circumcision both removes any scintilla of defence to a
      criminal charge and also defeats such a defence to a civil
      claim, against both the circumciser and his parents, by the
      child himself when of age.<br />
      <br />
       The wholly muddled, inadequate and ill-thought-out
      <i>Guidance</i> here does a grave disservice both to a
      minority of infant boys and, by exposing them to criminal and
      civil proceedings, to your members.<br />
      <br />
       Finally, I note that the <i>Guidance</i> drags out the weary
      argument: &ldquo;...it is argued that it is in the best interest
      of the child to be circumcised, to be accepted into a
      religion or community. Arguably the procedure can confer
      social benefits in some such circumstances.&rdquo; It is wholly
      improper and unlawful to impose on another person one's own
      religious or cultural views where so doing involves the
      physical mutilation of that unconsenting person. The <a
      href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm"
       target="_blank"><i>European Convention on Human
      Rights</i></a> (&ldquo;ECHR&rdquo;) echoes provisions found, for
      example in the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-human/"><i>Universal Declaration of
      Human Rights</i></a>, in providing (Article 8 ECHR) that:
      everyone has the right to respect for his private life; and
      private life has been found by the Court to include bodily
      integrity. Further, whilst Article 9 ECHR provides for
      freedom of religious belief, article 9(2) places a limit on
      the manifestation of those beliefs where to do so would
      interfere with, or deprive, another's freedoms and human
      rights.<br />
      <br />
       For any doctor to perform surgery on a person which carries
      no medical benefit and which is clearly harmful to that
      person is a grave breach of medical ethics (as well as the
      law). As the <a
      href="/library/ethics/hippocrates/">Hippocratic Oath</a> put
      it: &ldquo;The regimen I adopt shall be for the benefit of my
      patients according to my ability and judgement, and not for
      their hurt or for any house I enter, there will I go for the
      benefit of the sick, refraining from all wrongdoing or
      corruption&rdquo;; or in the Latin so beloved by lawyers <i>Primum
      non nocere</i>.<br />
      <br />
       

      <p>That the person is unconsenting only makes the breach
      worse.</p>

      <p><a href="/library/ethics/nuremberg/">The Nuremberg
      Code</a> (1947) (which followed the unspeakably depraved
      behaviour of the Nazis) as to medical ethics states:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Principle I: The voluntary consent of the human subject is
        absolutely essential. This means that the person involved
        should have the legal capacity to give consent; should be
        so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice,
        without the intervention of any element of force, fraud,
        deceit, duress, over-reaching or other ulterior form of
        constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient
        knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject
        matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding
        and enlightened decision.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Further, as to medical ethics, the British Medical
      Association itself has written:</p>

      <blockquote>
        The standard established by the World Medical
        Association&mdash;the <a
        href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/tokyo/">Declaration
        of Tokyo</a>&mdash;gives little scope for ambiguity on
        whether or not doctors should become involved in torture
        [of prisoners]. It makes it clear that &ldquo;the doctor shall
        not countenance, condone or participate in the practice of
        torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading
        procedures&rdquo; (emphasis added). There can be no doubt that
        non-therapeutic circumcision is a form of cruel and inhuman
        treatment with grave impact on the victim's physical and
        emotional health, function, and bodily integrity; and thus
        offending national and international laws.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Finally, performing or allowing, male infant circumcision
      is an act of discrimination. There are many attitudes which
      are, rightly, abhorred by a civilised society, condemned by
      international conventions and prohibited by national
      legislation: these include discrimination on various grounds.
      Yet the discrimination against boys in permitting the
      inevitably damaging mutilation of their genitals, whilst
      enacting legislation to declare as criminal the similar
      procedure when done to girls, is at the least as damaging as
      any other expression of discrimination, and given the
      resulting and irreparable sexual dysfunction the more so;
      this mutilation involves the amputation of highly functional
      and sensitive flesh, thereby ablating the victim's ability
      fully to enjoy sexual intercourse.</p>

      <p>Kluge, a female [sic] professor of philosophy, compares
      female circumcision with male circumcision and, expressing
      the same views on both, writes:</p>

      <p>&ldquo;To argue differently is to be guilty of discrimination
      on the basis of sex....Both involve what in other contexts
      would be called nonconsensual mutilation of a minor for
      non-medical reasons.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p>Further, to allow circumcision further discriminates
      between those boys who, because of an accident of birth, face
      non-therapeutic circumcision and those more fortunate boys
      who do not.</p>

      <p>Rejoicing, rightly, in our being a multi-cultural society
      does not, as has been demonstrated above, mean that we should
      be blind to practices, whatever their source and motive,
      which are themselves abusive and discriminatory of others,
      and which directly and inevitably diminish the freedoms, the
      human rights, the integrity and the dignity of others.</p>

      <p>I should be pleased to have your assurance that this
      mischievous Guidance will now be withdrawn and re-written so
      as to reflect properly the medical, legal and ethical
      issues.</p>

      <p>Yours sincerely</p>
      &nbsp;<br />
