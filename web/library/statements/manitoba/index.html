            <h2>Neonatal Circumcision</h2>

            <p><font face="Arial"><b>Background</b></font></p>

            <p>Circumcision of the male neonate is a common
            procedure in our society, usually for religious or
            cultural reasons. Male neonatal circumcision is not an
            innocuous procedure. Consideration should be given to
            factors which may affect the outcome. For the purposes
            of this guideline, "neonatal" is defined as the first
            month of life.</p>

            <p><font
            face="Arial"><b>Contraindications</b></font></p>

            <ul type="disc">
              <li>Congenital penile abnormalities, eg. hypospadias,
              chordae, prominent dorsal preputial hood with lack of
              ventral foreskin, micropenis, buried penis, penis
              with severe penoscrotal webbing. Neonates with such
              problems should be referred to a Urological
              Specialist.</li>

              <li>Known bleeding diathesis.</li>

              <li>Premature infant or an infant with medical
              complications.</li>

              <li>Family history of gross keloid formation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Indications</b></p>

            <p>Specific medical indications for the performance of
            circumcision in the neonate are rare. There may be
            benefits to circumcision in the prevention of phimosis,
            the prevention of urinary tract infection, reduction in
            the spread of the papillovirus, and the protection of
            men from infection with the Human Immunodeficiency
            Virus (HIV). The degree of benefit is small, however,
            and does not support a recommendation to circumcise
            neonates.</p>

            <p><b>The Following Conditions Are Not An Indication
            For Circumcision:</b></p>

            <ul type="disc">
              <li>Single urinary tract infection</li>

              <li>Difficulty retracting the foreskin (the foreskin
              is not normally retractable in the neonate)</li>

              <li>Prevention of balanitis</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Precautions</b></p>

            <ul type="disc">
              <li>The neonate who has a urinary tract infection
              (UTI) should be assessed by a specialist before the
              circumcision is recommended. Vesicoureteric reflux
              and/or urinary tract obstruction must be ruled out
              before circumcision would be contemplated. The
              foreskin may act as a reservoir for bacteria under
              such circumstances.</li>

              <li>The circumcision of neonates or infants with
              documented vesicoureteric reflux, in order to prevent
              recurrent infections, is still a controversial
              issue.</li>

              <li>Electro-cautery should not be used in newborn
              circumcision.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Informed Consent</b></p>

            <p>Parental consent must be obtained prior to the
            performance of circumcision. It is recommended that
            such discussions occur as part of prenatal care rather
            than hastily after the birth of the baby as has been
            the common practice. Complaints by parents are usually
            related to their expectations not being achieved.</p>

            <p><b>Timing Of Circumcision</b></p>

            <p>When performed, it is preferable that circumcision
            be done within the first month of life. If the
            procedure is not performed within the first month, most
            urologists advise that the procedure should be delayed
            until well after the neonatal period, unless a specific
            medical indication arises. In children above the age of
            three months, a free hand circumcision is preferable to
            a clamp or bell technique.</p>

            <p><b>Anaesthesia/Analgesia</b></p>

            <p>Infants do experience pain with neonatal
            circumcision, manifested by crying, elevation of the
            heart rate, and a measurable increase in serum cortisol
            levels. Evidence suggests that the use of approved
            topical analgesia or local infiltration (e.g. Dorsal
            penile nerve block) containing adrenaline free local
            anaesthetic are effective methods to block the pain of
            neonatal circumcision. Studies demonstrate that these
            techniques are simple and safe with little risk of
            complication to the newborn provided it is performed by
            a physician who is experienced in such procedures. It
            is imperative to ensure that injection is not
            intravascular or intracorporeal.</p>

            <p><b>Training Standards</b></p>

            <p>In order to be granted privileges in neonatal
            circumcision, the Physician must:</p>

            <ul type="disc">
              <li>Be registered and a licensed member of the <a
              href="http://www.cpsm.mb.ca/" target="_blank">College
              of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba</a>.</li>

              <li>Demonstrate competence in the performance of 10
              procedures proctored by a physician who has neonatal
              circumcision privileges and who agrees to provide
              documentation attesting to the competency of the
              other physician.</li>
            </ul>
