      <p class="cirp">[CIRP note: This excerpt from the
      Saskatchewan College of Physicians and Surgeon's <a
      href="/library/statements/sask2002/">position papers</a> was
      posted on the CPSBC because of the intense interest in their
      contents.]</p>

      <h2>Caution Regarding Routine Circumcision of Newborn Male
      Infants</h2>

      <p>Over the past six months, the Saskatchewan College has
      provided all its members with two documents discussing the
      issue of routine male circumcision. With permission of that
      College, the following excerpts are presented for your
      consideration:</p>

      <p><b>A.</b> Recommendations by the Saskatchewan College:</p>

      <p><b>(i)</b> Be sure that you as a physician are fully and
      accurately informed about the research literature on this
      subject, which serves as the basis for the Canadian
      Paediatric Society position against routine circumcision of
      newborn male infants. A copy of this position paper and a
      summary of the relevant research may be obtained from the <a
      href="http://www.quadrant.net/cpss/" target="_blank">CPSS
      website</a>.</p>

      <p><b>(ii)</b> In any dialogue with patients about potential
      circumcision of newborn male infants, be sure that you
      accurately and effectively convey the message that this is
      not a recommended procedure.</p>

      <p><b>(iii)</b> If parents remain adamant in their preference
      that circumcision be performed, notwithstanding their
      awareness of the research on the subject, remember that you
      are under no obligation to perform any surgical procedure for
      which there are not valid medical indications. You may, and
      should consider, respectfully declining to perform the
      procedure just as you respectfully decline to carry out other
      requested medical acts that you regard to be
      inappropriate.</p>

      <p><b>(iv)</b> If the parental request for infant male
      circumcision is based exclusively upon religious beliefs and
      values, and you are inclined to act in deference to those
      religious beliefs and values, you would be prudent to require
      parental signature on the consent document which clearly
      stipulates that the circumcision in question is not medically
      indicated and is being performed with parental religious
      practices.</p>

      <p><b>B.</b> It is the expectation of the College that all
      physicians exercise sound professional judgement in all the
      professional decisions they make. In the exercise of
      professional judgement, physicians ought to consider many
      factors, including the preference of patients (guardians),
      the best available evidence with respect to potential
      benefits and risks of a contemplated intervention, and
      alternatives to that intervention. Maintenance of
      professionalism demands that physicians decline to become
      little more than robots who perform an array of medical
      interventions on demand. No physician should be coerced to
      perform a medical procedure that is contrary to his/her
      professional judgement.</p>

      <p>When physicians receive requests for infant male
      circumcision, it is important that physicians take ample time
      to gain an understanding of the basis for the request, to
      provide accurate detailed information to parents about the
      potential benefits, risks and alternatives, and to gauge
      their understanding of that information.</p>

      <p>If parents persistently request circumcision of a newborn
      male infant after a thorough dialogue about benefits, risks
      and alternatives, a physician is not obligated to perform the
      procedure if he/she does not regard the procedure to be
      medically indicated and appropriate. Physicians may
      respectfully decline to perform this medical procedure, just
      as they respectfully decline to prescribe medications that
      are not medically indicated, and as they decline to offer
      medical opinions contrary to their best professional
      judgement.</p>

      <p>Where infant male circumcision is requested for religious
      rather than medical reasons, there is a high probability that
      the procedure will be performed by someone other than a
      physician if the option is not made available through a
      physician. Where a physician is confronted with a request for
      infant male circumcision based upon religious rather than
      medical reasons, and where physicians may be inclined to
      comply with such a request as the "lesser of two evils," even
      though contrary to his/her medical judgement, the College
      recommends that physicians obtain advice from the CMPA about
      appropriate documentation of the consent process, so that it
      explicitly defines the conditions under which the procedure
      is performed. 334 Obtaining informed consent for any
      procedure requires disclosure of all relative benefit and
      risks of the anticipated procedure, as well as alternatives
      to that procedure. A prudent physician will make a reasonable
      effort to achieve understanding of the information that is
      shared with parents/guardians.</p>

      <p>To formulate and certify a professional opinion that a
      patient has understood the nature, effect, risks and
      alternatives of a contemplated medical intervention requires
      more than one way disclosure of risks to the patient. It
      requires two way dialogue through which the physician has
      reasonable potential to gauge the understanding held by the
      patient or guardian.</p>

      <p>The Canadian Paediatric Society has concluded that the
      overall evidence of the benefits and harms of circumcision is
      so evenly balanced that it does not support recommended
      circumcision as a routine procedure for newborns. Infant male
      circumcision is often treated as a minor procedure with
      virtually no risk or significant complications. That is not
      true. Infant male circumcision may lead to complications that
      range from minor to severe. A study reported in the British
      Journal of Surgery (1993) suggested that complication rates
      range between 2%-10%.</p>

      <p>In many countries, including Canada, citizen groups are
      gaining a higher profile and more credibility among the
      general public. They are bringing to light new evidence that
      the male prepuce may play an important physiological and
      psychological role in adult male function, which has to date
      been largely ignored in any consideration of harm associated
      with infant male circumcision. As a consequence of the public
      awareness raised by these groups, a growing number of adult
      males and/or their parents are now expressing strong
      resentment against physicians who performed infant male
      circumcision many years ago at their request. The retroactive
      anger towards these patients is generally based upon
      arguments that parents were given woefully inadequate
      information about the potential adverse impact on adult male
      function, and inadequate information about normal infant
      penile development and hygiene. While the College's primary
      mandate is public protection, we encourage physicians to give
      careful thought to the long term risks that may occur by
      taking an inappropriately casual approach to infant male
      circumcision driven exclusively by parental preference
      without valid medical indications for the procedure.</p>
