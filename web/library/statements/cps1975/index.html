        IN THE NEWBORN PERIOD</b></font></p>
      </center>

      <table width="90%" cellpadding="10" summary="">
        <tr valign="top">
          <td width="45%">
            <ol align="justify">
              <li align="justify"><!--1-->It may be expected that
              local customs will influence any decision for or
              against routine circumcision of male infants during
              the first few days of life, For instance. this is
              rarely done in Britain, whereas in parts of
              California it is quite common, perhaps as an index of
              social status or virtually as universal policy in
              some large hospitals.</li>

              <li><!--2--><span class="yellow">Nevertheless, there
              is no medical indication for circumcision during the
              neonatal period.</span>*</li>

              <li><!--3-->Any claim for the presence of phimosis as
              a reason for circumcision during the first four years
              fails to acknowledge the natural history of tissue
              differentiation in the region destined to develop the
              cleavage between the prepuce on the outside and the
              glans deep to it, or of the range of variation in the
              rate of atrophy or redundant foreskin within that age
              group.</li>

              <li><!--4-->Any assertion that a policy against
              routine circumcision has predisposed infants to
              phimosis or paraphimosis cannot be valid without
              first ruling out the possibility that the infants in
              question had experienced the common practice of
              forceful retraction of the prepuce just after birth,
              using the fingers alone or aided by a probe to break
              down the "adhesions"&mdash;really the undifferentiated
              tissue, and perhaps a haemostat to stretch the
              preputial orifice. The scarring effects of such a
              manipulation, usually an unrecorded procedure, are
              more hazardous than either circumcision itself or
              unmolested non-circumcision.</li>

              <li><!--5-->Such unrecorded manipulations and
              subsequent fibrosis have not been exonerated as the
              initiating cause of troublesome collections of smegma
              which are sometimes found in children considered
              prone to the complications of neglected personal
              hygiene.</li>

              <li><!--6-->The more immediate hazards of
              circumcision include infection which may be minor, or
              which could lead to gangrene or general sepsis,
              severe haemorrhage, mutilative deformity of the
              penis, or rarely, a procedural misadventure requiring
              partial amputation of the penis.</li>

              <li><!--7-->Later complications include the
              excoriation of the exposed edges of the glans from a
              diaper dermatitis, or a similar lesion at the
              urethral meatus, resulting in stenosis in some cases.
              The narrowed passage may produce obstructive uropathy
              and its more serious consequences.</li>

              <li><!--8-->There seems to be little basis for
              prescribing routine circumcision because of a fear of
              cancer of the uncircumcised prepuce developing in a
              septuagenarian. It is an infrequently encountered
              lesion, easy to detect and unlikely to spread. This
              remote possibility of a curable condition of very old
              age stands in sharp contrast to the established
              hazards of neonatal circumcision.</li>

              <li><!--9-->There is no foundation to the belief that
              in adult life, circumcision adds or reduces tactile
              sensation in the adult penis during intercourse.
              <font color="navy"><b>[CIRP note: This statement has
              been disproved. See <a
              href="http://research.cirp.org/" target="_blank">The
              Ridged Band: Specialized Sexual
              Tissue</a>.]</b></font></li>

              <li><!--10-->The claim that circumcision is
              associated with a reduced prevalence of venereal
              diseases in the adult male, or a decreased frequency
              of cervical carcinoma in the sexual partner, has not
              been established as a cause-and-effect
              relationship.</li>

              <li><!--11-->Although the desire for conformity has
              sometimes influenced a parent's or doctor's decision,
              intended to ensure that the newborn infant in
              question will grow up to have genital resemblance
              with his father and brothers, any important
              conformity must now be considered in relation with
              the peer group in a society with a rapidly
              diminishing demand for circumcision.</li>

              <li><!--12-->Because a decision to circumcise in the
              newborn period must be ascribed to social rather than
              medical reasons, it would be even more inappropriate
              in an infant who is destined for adoption or other
              placement to impose the operation before the
              transition into the new family setting has been
              completed. A natural parent giving up a child for
              such placement should not be empowered to authorize
              circumcision, nor should a social agency be
              responsible for such a decision on behalf of the
              infant. Such an agency would be overstepping any
              mandate provided by its Provincial Protection of
              Children Act.</li>

              <li><!--13-->Certainly, <a
              href="http://www.nocirc.org/intersexed/"
              target="_blank">no circumcision should be performed
              on an infant with a hypospadias</a>, or any other
              genital abnormality no matter how slight, until a
              careful diagnosis has been made, together with an
              assignment of sex if necessary, and a detailed plan
              of management has been developed.</li>

              <li><!--14-->Although there is some unresolved
              contention about the propriety of performing
              circumcision during the first few days of life, there
              is no disagreement in condemning the practice of
              carrying out this procedure while the infant is still
              in the delivery room. During his first few hours, he
              must be protected against the stress of pain and the
              possible <a
              href="/library/complications/spence1/">exposure to
              cold</a>, each of which may interfere with the
              success of the cardiovascular and pulmonary
              adjustments necessary for adequate respiratory
              function after birth. Also, so soon after birth,
              there is a greater chance of inadequate awareness,
              should there be a familial bleeding tendency that
              would have been a positive contra-indication for
              circumcision.</li>

              <li><!--15-->If circumcision is to be carried out
              later during the first few days, it should be
              performed by the person most adept at the procedure,
              and most readily available and capable to deal with
              any early complications. If paediatricians are
              showing leadership in curtailing the numbers of
              mutilative operations of questionable benefit, it is
              likely that uninformed parents may turn to their
              family physician or obstetrician to perpetuate such
              an <a href="/library/legal/fisher1/">obsolete
              operation</a>. Therefore, discussion of this subject
              should be encouraged among all who may deal with
              parents, both among the medical and nursing
              professions.</li>

              <li><!--16-->The actual technique of circumcision,
              whether by the classical method with scalpel and
              sutures, or using the Gomco clamp, seems less
              important than the individual choice according to the
              individual operator's skill and preference. Care
              should be taken, however, to ensure that the bell in
              socket of the clamp has not worn to such a degree as
              to allow less than total crushing force evenly
              distributed along the circumference of the prepuce.
              The reported misadventure in the literature, and the
              lack of any impressive review, should make one
              reluctant to recommend the disposable Plastibell
              device for this operation.</li>

              <li><!--17-->Although the neonatal infant is given
              only a sugar ball to suck on as a soother against the
              pain, no one would perform a circumcision on a
              two-month old infant without first administering
              anaesthesia. This seems incongruous in the absence of
              any known neurophysiological difference between these
              two age groups that would justify such a discrepancy
              in approach. If there is validity in this
              consideration, the alternatives would have to be an
              acceptance of the added risk of anaesthesia for each
              newborn infant undergoing circumcision, or else the
              conclusion that such a risk or the vagal and
              psychological consequences of withholding pain relief
              should remove any remaining defence of the
              circumcision routine.</li>

              <li><!--18-->The appropriate time in which to
              enlighten prospective parents about contemporary
              concepts of circumcision is during prenatal care.
              Therefore, family physicians. obstetricians and
              nurses should be invited to consider these facts and
              opinions.</li>

              <li><!--19-->In the search for ways in which to stem
              the rising cost of health care, the removal of such
              an unnecessary procedure as a routine practice can be
              calculated as a major saving in terms of direct
              charges - professional fees, nursing and other
              hospital services and supplies, and sometimes the
              length of hospital stay - and secondary costs
              resulting from any recognized clinical
              complications.</li>

              <li><!--20--><span class="yellow">Adoption of the
              foregoing concepts should result in a sharper
              decrease in the percentage of infants
              circumcised,</span> and thus a reason to convert a
              hospital circumcision room to a more useful function,
              e.g. a parents' room for privacy with their baby, a
              breast feeding room for the mother discharged before
              the infant, or if in an appropriate area, a
              laboratory supporting foetal and neonatal intensive
              care. The greatly reduced numbers of circumcisions
              may be performed in facilities used for other
              procedures requiring aseptic control, e.g. exchange
              transfusion and lumbar puncture in the infant.
              Facilities in a maternity unit should not be expected
              to serve the requirements of an infant already sent
              home from his place of birth.</li>

              <li><!--21-->Ritual circumcisions are performed for
              religious reasons and are therefore outside the
              category of medical or social indications. Because
              these ritual rites are performed on the eight day,
              beyond the usual length of newborn infant stay, it
              seems unlikely that any special facility will be
              required for this purpose in any new construction of
              maternity facilities.</li>

        <h3>BENEFITS AND RISKS OF CIRCUMCISION: ANOTHER VIEW</h3>
        <br />
        <b>Platform of the Fetus and Newborn Committee of the
        Canadian Paediatric Society</b> 

        <p align="justify">The review by Warner and Strashin(1)
        clearly presented the arguments for and against
        circumcision and the contraindications. However, the most
        important reason for favouring circumcision - that is,
        preventing carcinoma of the penis - is not completely
        established. In addition, Warner and Strashin overly
        minimized the risks of circumcision. They also did not
        include the cost of complications of neonatal circumcision
        in their cost benefit analysis.</p>

        <p align="justify">While the literature suggests that
        circumcision may protect against carcinoma of the penis,
        the case is not entirely proven. There are, for example,
        wide differences in the incidence of penile carcinoma among
        African tribes that do not practise circumcision.(2) In
        Sweden, where circumcision is rare, the incidence of penile
        carcinoma is low.(3) It is possible that there are genetic
        or environmental factors that influence the incidence of
        this carcinoma and, by coincidence, are associated with
        circumcision. Warner and Strashin do recognize that the
        protective role of circumcision is not completely
        established. In their conclusions they stated that "cancer
        of the penis may be prevented by circumcision", but in the
        abstract of the article the crucial word "may" is
        omitted.</p>

        <p align="justify">Warner and Strashin discussed the
        literature on the incidence of early complications,
        including the report by Gee and Ansell(4), which noted one
        life-threatening hemorrhage, four cases of septicemia and
        one case of complete penile denudation, as well as
        circumcision in eight cases of hypospadias among 5000
        circumcised boys. Then they concluded that "hemorrhage,
        infection and other immediate complications..... are easily
        treated; those that are not are very rare". The potential
        for meningeal spread from septicemia and the hospital costs
        for these complications were ignored. Neither did they
        discuss problems resulting from inappropriate management of
        the prepuce that can result in the need for later
        circumcision. Phimosis commonly follows infantile
        balanitis, which occurs when premature and energetic
        attempts are made to break down the incorrectly named
        "preputial adhesions" the epithelial tissue that has not
        yet separated into planes. This lack of separation is
        normal in newborns and may not be completed until the age
        of 16 or 17 years.(5) &Oslash;ster(5) reported that among
        1968 schoolboys examined annually for 8 years the incidence
        of phimosis was 8% at age 6 to 7 years but only 1% by the
        age of 16 to 17 years. How many physicians recommending and
        carrying out circumcision in schoolboys know this? A survey
        of 60 pediatricians in the United States revealed that 78%
        did not know at what age the prepuce might normally be
        retracted.(6) <a
        href="/library/general/oster/">&Oslash;ster</a>(5) found
        that only 3 (0.15%) of the 1968 boys required circumcision.
        Thus, the true need for later circumcision may be greatly
        exaggerated.</p>

        <p align="justify">McKim's editorial on circumcision also
        minimized the risks of this operation in the newborn
        period.(7) The risks should indeed be minimal; however,
        because circumcision is not always carried out by
        "experienced, skilful surgeons", surgical complications are
        regularly seen and are not "extremely rare", as McKim
        stated.</p>

        <p align="justify">Certainly the good teaching and
        supervision of neonatal circumcision McKim pleaded for are
        vital.</p>

        <p align="justify">In the past we made many errors when
        therapeutic approaches were developed in the absence of
        adequate proof of efficacy.(8) Silverman(8) has emphasized
        our need not only to learn from past experiences but also
        to ensure that we use the correct methods to evaluate our
        interventions.</p>

        <p align="justify">Several years ago the fetus and newborn
        committee of the Canadian Paediatric Society carefully
        reviewed the pros and cons of circumcision; the conclusions
        were published in a statement in 1975.(9) The intentions of
        this statement was to reduce the number of unnecessary
        circumcisions and the complications that might result.
        (Incidentally, Warner and Strashin did not refer to this
        review.) The present fetus and newborn committee sees no
        reason for modifying the <a href="#y1975">statement of the
        previous committee</a> and is concerned that a completely
        balanced view be available to the physician asked to decide
        upon the necessity for circumcision.</p>

        <p align="justify">In 1975, the CPS Foetus and Newborn
        Committee carefully reviewed the pros and cons of
        circumcision and published the conclusion that routine
        circumcision was not necessary.</p>

        <p align="justify">In 1982, the Committee saw no reason to
        modify the previous statement. However, they advocated that
        a completely balanced view be available from the physician
        in order to make a decision regarding the necessity for
        circumcision.</p>

        <p align="justify">In 1988, a growing concern arose due to
        a report by T.E. Wiswell (see 1 and 2 below) which showed a
        decreased incidence of urinary tract infections in
        circumcised male infants. Due to these concerns the Board
        asked the Foetus and Newborn and the Infectious Diseases
        and Immunization Committees to study the report.</p>

        <p align="justify"><span class="yellow">As the present
        information available concerning the risks of urinary tract
        infections and transmission of sexually transmitted
        diseases in relation to circumcision are not sufficiently
        compelling to justify a change in policy,</span> the
        Committees maintain that no change should be made to the <a
        href="#y1975">CPS recommendations concerning routine
        circumcision</a>.</p>

        <p align="justify">We will continue to monitor the
        situation.</p>
