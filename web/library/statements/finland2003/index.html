        <h3>Helsinki 25.8.2003</h3>

        <h3>Position Statement on the Circumcision of Boys</h3>

        <h3>Presented to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health
        (STM060:00/2003)</h3>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">The <a
      href="http://www.lskl.fi/showPage.php?page_id=38"
      target="_blank">Central Union for Child Welfare</a> considers
      that circumcision of boys that violates the personal
      integrity of the boys is not acceptable unless it is done for
      medical reasons to treat an illness. The basis for the
      measures of a society must be an unconditional respect for
      the bodily integrity of an under-aged person.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision intervenes in the sexual
      integrity of a male child causing a permanent change in
      organisms and has consequences pertaining to both health and
      quality of life.</p>

      <p class="text2">The circumcision of girls is rightly
      considered as inhuman mutilation of the genitals and is
      punished abuse. Also boys must be guaranteed a similar
      protection by law.</p>

      <p class="text2">According to the opinion of the Central
      Union for Child Welfare in Finland nobody has the right, on
      behalf of the child, to consent to operation, violating the
      bodily integrity of the child, if it is not done to treat an
      illness. According to the <a
      href="http://www.finlex.fi/pdf/saadkaan/E9830683.PDF"
      target="_blank">Child Welfare Act</a> the child has a right
      to special protection. The <a
      href="http://www.finlex.fi/pdf/saadkaan/E9940556.PDF"
      target="_blank">Child Custody and Right of Access Act</a>
      bans the subduing and humiliation of a child.</p>

      <p class="text2">The <a
      href="http://www.finlex.fi/pdf/saadkaan/E9990731.PDF"
      target="_blank">Constitution</a> guarantees physical
      integrity. The motivations of the Constitution state
      explicitly that freedom of religion does not entitle [anyone]
      to violate the integrity of another person. It also states
      that a child shall be treated as an individual person who has
      full fundamental rights from birth. Intentional causing of
      pain and injury is defined as assault in the criminal law and
      is punishable. The <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-convention/"
      target="_blank">UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>
      that Finland has ratified demands that the States Parties
      shall take all effective and appropriate measures with a view
      to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health
      of children.</p>

      <p class="text2"><a
      href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm"
       target="_blank">Convention for the Protection of Human
      Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the
      Application of Biology and Medicine</a> that Finland has
      signed and that that is prepared to be ratified, states that
      an intervention may only be carried out on a person who does
      not have the capacity to consent, for his or her direct
      benefit.</p>

      <p class="text2">The position of the Central Union for Child
      Welfare is that no law allowing the circumcision of boys
      shall be decreed.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Central Union for Child Welfare in
      Finland hopes that the working group in the <a
      href="http://www.stm.fi/Resource.phx/eng/index.htx"
      target="_blank">Ministry of Social Affairs and Health</a>
      will consider measures to bring about a cultural change that
      will secure the integrity of children and leads to the end of
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision can only be allowed to
      independent major persons, both women and men, after it has
      been ascertained that the person in question wants it of his
      or her own free will and he or she has not been subjected to
      pressure.</p>

      <p>Helsinki 25.8.2003</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP postscript: In 2006, a Finnish court
      ruled that the circumcision of male children is unlawful in
      Finland. For more information see: <a

      circumcision of four-year-old boy illegal</a>.]</p>
