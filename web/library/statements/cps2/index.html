      <h2>BENEFITS AND RISKS OF CIRCUMCISION: ANOTHER VIEW</h2>
      <b>Platform of the Fetus and Newborn Committee of the
      Canadian Paediatric Society</b> 

      <p>The review by Warner and Strashin<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> clearly presented the arguments for
      and against circumcision and the contraindications. However,
      the most important reason for favouring circumcision &ndash;
      that is, preventing carcinoma of the penis &ndash; is not
      completely established. In addition, Warner and Strashin
      overly minimized the risks of circumcision. They also did not
      include the cost of complications of neonatal circumcision in
      their cost benefit analysis.</p>

      <p>While the literature suggests that circumcision may
      protect against carcinoma of the penis, the case is not
      entirely proven. There are, for example, wide differences in
      the incidence of penile carcinoma among African tribes that
      do not practise circumcision.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      In Sweden, where circumcision is rare, the incidence of
      penile carcinoma is low.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> It is
      possible that there are genetic or environmental factors that
      influence the incidence of this carcinoma and, by
      coincidence, are associated with circumcision. Warner and
      Strashin do recognize that the protective role of
      circumcision is not completely established. In their
      conclusions they stated that "cancer of the penis may be
      prevented by circumcision", but in the abstract of the
      article the crucial word "may" is omitted.</p>

      <p>Warner and Strashin discussed the literature on the
      incidence of early complications, including the report by Gee
      and Ansell<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>, which noted one
      life-threatening hemorrhage, four cases of septicemia and one
      case of complete penile denudation, as well as circumcision
      in eight cases of hypospadias among 5000 circumcised boys.
      Then they concluded that "hemorrhage, infection and other
      immediate complications..... are easily treated; those that
      are not are very rare". The potential for meningeal spread
      from septicemia and the hospital costs for these
      complications were ignored. Neither did they discuss problems
      resulting from inappropriate management of the prepuce that
      can result in the need for later circumcision. Phimosis
      commonly follows infantile balanitis, which occurs when
      premature and energetic attempts are made to break down the
      incorrectly named "preputial adhesions" the epithelial tissue
      that has not yet separated into planes. This lack of
      separation is normal in newborns and may not be completed
      until the age of 16 or 17 years.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> &Oslash;ster<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> reported that among 1968 schoolboys
      examined annually for 8 years the incidence of phimosis was
      8% at age 6 to 7 years but only 1% by the age of 16 to 17
      years. How many physicians recommending and carrying out
      circumcision in schoolboys know this? A survey of 60
      pediatricians in the United States revealed that 78% did not
      know at what age the prepuce might normally be
      retracted.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> &Oslash;ster<sup><a
      href="#5">5</a></sup> found that only 3 (0.15%) of the 1968
      boys required circumcision. Thus, the true need for later
      circumcision may be greatly exaggerated.</p>

      <p>McKim's editorial on circumcision also minimized the risks
      of this operation in the newborn period.<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> The risks should indeed be minimal;
      however, because circumcision is not always carried out by
      "experienced, skilful surgeons", surgical complications are
      regularly seen and are not "extremely rare", as McKim
      stated.</p>

      <p>Certainly the good teaching and supervision of neonatal
      circumcision McKim pleaded for are vital.</p>

      <p>In the past we made many errors when therapeutic
      approaches were developed in the absence of adequate proof of
      efficacy.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> Silverman<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> has emphasized our need not only to
      learn from past experiences but also to ensure that we use
      the correct methods to evaluate our interventions.</p>

      <p>Several years ago the fetus and newborn committee of the
      Canadian Paediatric Society carefully reviewed the pros and
      cons of circumcision; the conclusions were published in a
      statement in 1975.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> The
      intentions of this statement was to reduce the number of
      unnecessary circumcisions and the complications that might
      result. (Incidentally, Warner and Strashin did not refer to
      this review.) The present fetus and newborn committee sees no
      reason for modifying the statement of the previous committee
      and is concerned that a completely balanced view be available
      to the physician asked to decide upon the necessity for
      circumcision.</p>
