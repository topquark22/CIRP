      <p>Neonatal circumcision is one of the most common surgical
      procedures performed in the United States. However, little is
      known about the long-term risks and benefits. There have been
      few methodologically generalizable prospective studies
      concerning medical outcomes.</p>

      <p>The AAFP Commission on Science has reviewed the literature
      regarding neonatal circumcision. Evidence from the literature
      is often conflicting or inconclusive. Most parents base their
      decision whether or not to have their newborn son circumcised
      on nonmedical preferences (i.e. religious, ethnic, cultural,
      cosmetic). The American Academy of Family Physicians
      recommends physicians discuss the potential harms and
      benefits of circumcision with all parents or legal guardians
      considering this procedure for their newborn son.</p>

      <p style="font-family: Arial"><a
      href="/library/statistics/bollinger2003/"><b>Epidemiology</b></a></p>

      <p>An estimated 1 million circumcisions are performed each
      year in the United States. (<a href="#n1">1</a>) The rate of
      circumcision began rapidly to increase prior to World War II.
      The percent of men circumcised increased from 34% in 1932 to
      60% in 1935. (<a href="#n2">2</a>) In 1960, over 80% of men
      in the United States were circumcised. However, the
      percentage is now decreasing, and in 1992 the prevalence of
      circumcised men was estimated to be 77%. (<a
      href="#n2">2</a>) One study found that between 1987 and 1996,
      37% of newborn males were circumcised during newborn
      hospitalization. (<a href="#n3">3</a>) Circumcision rates are
      shown to differ among racial and ethnic groups. (<a
      href="#n2">2</a>)</p>

      <p style="font-family: Arial"><b>Contraindications to
      Neonatal Circumcision</b></p>

      <p>Circumcision should not be performed until at least 12 to
      24 hours after birth to ensure that the infant is stable.
      This period of observation allows for recognition of
      abnormalities or illnesses that should either be addressed
      before circumcision (e.g., hyperbilirubinemia or infection)
      or would be a contraindication for the procedure (e.g.,
      bleeding diathesis). When there is a family history of a
      bleeding disorder, appropriate laboratory studies should be
      done to identify a possible clotting dysfunction. Infants
      with genital-urinary congenital anomalies, particularly
      hypospadias, should not be circumcised because the foreskin
      is frequently used in reconstruction. Premature infants
      should meet criteria for discharge from the nursery before
      circumcision is performed. (<a href="#n4">4</a>)</p>

      <p style="font-family: Arial"><b><a
      href="/library/complications/">Complications</a> of Neonatal
      Circumcision</b></p>

      <p>Neonatal circumcision has an estimated complication rate
      ranging from 0.1% to 35%. The vast majority of complications
      are infection, bleeding, and failure to remove enough
      foreskin. (<a href="#n5">5</a>) One study of more than
      350,000 newborns identified a complication rate of 1/476 (<a
      href="#n3">3</a>) and another study estimated a complication
      rate of 1/100. (<a href="#n4">4</a>) Meatitis and meatal
      stenosis are more serious complications that have been
      reported to occur in 8% to 21% of circumcised infants, (<a
      href="#n6">6</a>) however no well-controlled cohort study has
      clearly identified a causal relationship between circumcision
      and meatitis. (<a href="#n7">7</a>) Although meatitis is
      believed to occur more frequently in circumcised infants, <a
      href="/library/disease/balanitis/">balanoposthitis</a> is
      believed to occur more frequently in uncircumcised children.
      (<a href="#n8">8</a>) Serious complications, such as <a
      href="http://www.infocirc.org/fourn.htm">necrotizing
      fascitis</a>, <a
      href="/library/complications/limaye/">urethral fistula</a>,
      <a href="/library/complications/gluckman/">partial penile
      amputation</a>, <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/gearhart1/">penile
      necrosis</a> and <a
      href="/library/complications/bergeson/">concealed penis</a>,
      have been reported. (<a href="#n9">9</a>) Death is rare, and
      mortality risk has been estimated to be 1/500,000 procedures.
      (<a href="#n10">10</a>)</p>

      <p style="font-family: Arial"><a
      href="/library/disease/UTI/"><b>Urinary Tract
      Infections</b></a></p>

      <p>Male infants account for 75% of urinary tract infections
      (UTIs) among infants less than 3 months of age, and comprise
      11% of UTIs in infants between 3 to 8 months of age. (<a
      href="#n11">11</a>) One study found that of 62 male infants
      with a confirmed UTI, 95% were uncircumcised. (<a
      href="#n11">11</a>) Another study reviewed a 5 year period of
      U.S. military hospital records and found that 0.14% of 80,274
      circumcised infants and 1.4% of 27,319 uncircumcised infants
      developed a UTI. (<a href="#n12">12</a>) Although an
      uncircumcised infant has been estimated to have 3 to 20 times
      the risk of developing a UTI compared to a circumcised
      infant, the absolute risk increase is about 1%. (<a
      href="#n12">12</a>) One study reports that 195 circumcisions
      are needed to prevent one UTI, (<a href="#n4">4</a>) and
      another reports a number needed to treat (NNT) of 90. (<a
      href="#n3">3</a>) Upper tract urinary infection, namely
      pyelonephritis, is reported to occur in 21% to 78% of infants
      and children with symptomatic UTI. (<a href="#n13">13</a>)
      Renal scarring is estimated to develop in 10% to 15% of cases
      of pyelonephritis, and of those approximately 2% to 3% will
      develop end-stage renal disease. (<a href="#n14">14</a>)</p>

      <p style="font-family: Arial"><b><a
      href="/library/disease/STD/">Sexually Transmitted
      Diseases</a> and <a href="/library/disease/HIV/">Human
      Immunodeficiency Virus</a></b></p>

      <p>Overall, the studies investigating the association between
      having a sexually transmitted disease (STD)-excluding human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)- and being circumcised are
      inconclusive. (<a href="#n4">4</a>) Although a number of
      studies did find that uncircumcised men had higher rates of
      STDs, the majority of these studies had methodological
      limitations. (<a href="#n5">5</a>) The foreskin is thought to
      provide a <a href="/library/anatomy/prakash/">moist
      environment</a> to harbor bacteria and viruses, and some
      studies suggest an association with being uncircumcised and
      developing ulcerative STDs (i.e., syphilis, chancroid, and
      genital herpes)(<a href="#n15">15</a>); however, the evidence
      does not show an association of being uncircumcised with
      developing <a
      href="/library/disease/STD/smith/">nongonococcal
      urethritis</a> or <a
      href="/library/disease/STD/cook2/">genital warts</a>. (<a
      href="#n16">16</a>) From one study of 2,776 documented cases
      of a STD, uncircumcised compared to circumcised men had an
      odds ratio of 4.0 (1.9 to 8.4) of having syphilis, an odds
      ratio of 1.6 (1.2 to 2.2) of having gonorrhea, and an odds
      ratio of 0.7 (0.5 to 0.9) of having <a
      href="/library/disease/STD/cook2/">genital warts</a>; the
      association for <a
      href="/library/disease/STD/smith/">nongonococcal
      urethritis</a>, <a
      href="/library/general/laumann/">chlamydia</a> and <a
      href="/library/disease/STD/donovan2/">genital herpes</a> as
      not significant. (<a href="#n17">17</a>) Some believe that
      the risk of having a STD is more strongly related to sexual
      practices than to the presence of a foreskin. (<a
      href="#n2">2</a>)</p>

      <p>Most of the <a
      href="/library/disease/HIV/vanhowe4/">studies</a> on the
      relationship between acquiring HIV and being circumcised have
      been conducted in developing countries, particular those in
      Africa. Because of the challenges with maintaining good
      hygiene and access to condoms, these results are probably not
      generalizable to the U.S. population. These studies did,
      however, find an association between contracting HIV and
      being uncircumcised. Based on two of the African prospective
      studies, an estimated 10 to 20 circumcisions are needed to
      prevent one infection of HIV. (<a href="#n4">4</a>) A
      literature review estimated that the risk ratios of HIV
      sero-conversion for uncircumcised men compared to circumcised
      men ranged from 2.3 to 8.1. (<a href="#n18">18</a>)
      Limitations to the studies from which these risk ratios are
      derived include poor sampling, a low rate of acquiring the
      disease, and not controlling for confounders such as the
      number of sexual partners or other sexual practices. Because
      ulcerative STDs are more common in uncircumcised men than
      circumcised men, one hypothesis is that these lesions
      increase the probability of one becoming infected if exposed
      to HIV. (<a href="#n19">19</a>)</p>

      <p style="font-family: Arial"><b>Cancer of the Penis</b></p>

      <p><a href="/library/disease/cancer/">Penile carcinoma</a> is
      a rare disease in the United States with an estimated 750 to
      1,000 cases diagnosed each year. There is a large variation
      in the incidence of penile cancer among countries where most
      men are uncircumcised. For example, <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/frisch/">Denmark</a> has an
      annual incidence of 0.8 cases per 100,000 men compared to
      India which has an annual incidence of 10.5. (<a
      href="#n4">4</a>) As with UTIs, the relative risk for
      uncircumcised men is a moderate 3.2, but the annual absolute
      risk increase is extremely small at 0.31 cases per 100,000
      men per year, which would correspond to a NNT of over 300,000
      to prevent one case of penile cancer per year. (<a
      href="#n20">20,4</a>) However, one study estimates that 600
      circumcisions are needed to prevent one lifetime case of
      penile cancer, and another study presents a NNT of 900. (<a
      href="#n21">21,3</a>) Based on these NNTs, the absolute risk
      reduction for preventing one case of penile cancer per
      lifetime is less than 0.2%. In general, careful hygiene is
      believed to be important in preventing penile cancer. (<a
      href="#n5">5</a>)</p>

      <p style="font-family: Arial"><b>Cancer of the Cervix</b></p>

      <p>Both cervical carcinoma and dysplasia are associated with
      specific serotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV). Because the
      foreskin provides a hospitable environment for viruses, some
      believe that a woman whose partner is uncircumcised may be at
      increased risk for cervical carcinoma. (<a
      href="#n22">22</a>) The studies, which are methodologically
      challenged, have had conflicting results, yet most have found
      no association. (<a href="#n23">23</a>) Clearly identified
      independent risk factors for developing cervical cancer
      include early age of first sexual activity, multiple
      partners, and <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/ho1/">smoking</a>. In summary,
      the evidence to support an association between circumcision
      status and the risk of developing cervical cancer is
      inconclusive.</p>

      <p style="font-family: Arial"><a
      href="/library/sex_function/"><b>Sexual Functioning and
      Penile Problems</b></a></p>

      <p>The effect of circumcision on penile sensation or sexual
      satisfaction is unknown. Because the epithelium of a
      circumcised glans becomes cornified, and because some feel
      nerve over-stimulation leads to desensitization, many believe
      that the glans of a circumcised penis is less sensitive.
      Opinions differ about how this decreased sensitivity, which
      may result in prolonged time to orgasm, affects sexual
      satisfaction. An investigation of the exteroceptive and light
      tactile discrimination of the glans of circumcised and
      uncircumcised men found no difference on comparison. (<a
      href="#n24">24</a>) No valid evidence to date, however,
      supports the notion that being circumcised affects sexual
      sensation or satisfaction.</p>

      <p style="font-family: Arial"><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/"><b>Anesthesia</b></a></p>

      <p>Newborns experience pain during circumcision. (<a
      href="#n1">1</a>) When anesthesia is used, methods include
      the topical eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA), the
      dorsal penile nerve block (DPB), and the ring block. A
      randomized controlled trial investigating these methods in 52
      infants found that all provided more analgesia than placebo
      based on heart rate, cry, and methemoglobin levels, and that
      the <a href="/library/pain/hardwick-smith1/">ring block</a>
      was the most effective. (<a href="#n25">25</a>) Complications
      from local anesthesia are uncommon and consist mainly of
      hematomas and local skin necrosis. The most common
      complication is bruising; one study on complications found
      bruising in 11% of neonates who had a DPB, (<a
      href="#n26">26</a>) and another found a minor complication
      rate of 1.2%, of which bruising was the most frequent. (<a
      href="#n27">27</a>) There have not been any studies to
      evaluate the long-term complications of the various
      analgesics.</p>

      <p style="font-family: Arial"><b>Future Need for
      Circumcision</b></p>

      <p>Penile cancer is claimed by some to be an indication for
      circumcision in the adult, but its prevalence is low.
      Recurrent balanitis is an indication, particularly in men
      with diabetes mellitus. A frequent indication is phimosis,
      which cannot be diagnosed in the newborn because the cleavage
      plane between the glans and the deep preputial layer of the
      penis in not developed at birth; often the foreskin is not
      retractable until 3 years of age.<font color="navy">[CIRP
      Note: This statement is based on information from the 1940s.
      More recent evidence indicates that the foreskin is
      frequently not retractable until after puberty.]</font> An
      estimated 10% of men will develop phimosis. (<a
      href="#n28">28,29</a>) Although neonatal circumcision has
      fewer complications than adult circumcision, evidence to
      support routine neonatal circumcision in order to prevent the
      need for adult circumcision is not available.</p>

      <p style="font-family: Arial"><b>Informed Consent and the
      Medical Ethics of Circumcision</b></p>

      <p>Obtaining <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/consent/">informed consent</a>
      for medical procedures is an important practice. In emergent
      cases when a parent or legal guardian is not available to
      give consent, a procedure will often be performed if it is
      judged to be life-sustaining and in the best interest of the
      patient. When a person having a procedure is unable to give
      consent and a guardian is present, the guardian's consent is
      acceptable. This occurs for routine medical procedures of
      clear benefit to children such as immunizations. A physician
      performing a procedure for other than medical reasons on a
      nonconsenting patient raises <a
      href="/library/legal/boyle1/">ethical concerns</a>.</p>

      <p>While routine circumcision is widely practiced, the small
      medical benefits of circumcision lead many to consider
      routine circumcision to be a cosmetic procedure. This leads
      to questions regarding <a
      href="/library/ethics/hodges3/">medical ethics</a> and
      whether and how to present to a parent a balanced discussion
      of the relative benefits and harms of the procedure. Key to
      the ethical discussion is respect of the parent's religious,
      ethnic, or other cultural beliefs for which circumcision is
      practiced.</p>

      <p style="font-family: Arial"><b>Economic Analysis</b></p>

      <p>One cost-effectiveness analysis estimated that the
      lifetime cost difference for men who were circumcised was
      $25, with a benefit of 10 additional days of life. (<a
      href="#n30">30</a>) Another analysis estimated that routine
      circumcision cost $102 per person, resulting in 14 hours of
      extended life. (<a href="#n31">31</a>) These findings suggest
      that cost factors should be removed from the decision of
      circumcision. (<a href="#n4">4</a>)</p>

      <p style="font-family: Arial"><b>Summary</b></p>

      <p>Considerable controversy surrounds neonatal circumcision.
      Putative indications for neonatal circumcision have included
      preventing UTIs and their sequelae, preventing the
      contraction of STDs including the HIV, and preventing penile
      cancer as well as other reasons for adult circumcision.
      Circumcision is not without risks. Bleeding, infection, and
      failure to remove enough foreskin occur in less than 1% of
      circumcisions. Evidence-based complications from circumcision
      include pain, bruising, and <a
      href="/library/complications#meatitis">meatitis</a>. More
      serious complications have also occurred. Although numerous
      studies have been conducted to evaluate these postulates,
      only a few used the quality of methodology necessary to
      consider the results as high level evidence.</p>

      <p>The evidence indicates that neonatal circumcision prevents
      UTIs in the first year of life with an absolute risk
      reduction of about 1% and prevents the development of penile
      cancer with an absolute risk reduction of less than 0.2%. The
      evidence suggests that circumcision reduces the rate of
      acquiring a STD, but careful sexual practices and hygiene may
      be as effective. Circumcision appears to decrease the
      transmission of HIV in underdeveloped areas where the virus
      is highly prevalent. No study has systematically evaluated
      the utility of routine neonatal circumcision for preventing
      all medically-indicated circumcisions in later life. Evidence
      regarding the association between cervical cancer and a
      woman's partner being circumcised or uncircumcised, and
      evidence regarding the effect of circumcision on sexual
      functioning is inconclusive. If the decision is made to
      circumcise, anesthesia should be used.</p>

      <p>The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends
      physicians discuss the potential harms and benefits of
      circumcision with all parents or legal guardians considering
      this procedure for their newborn son.</p>

    the individual judgment brought to each clinical situation by
    the patient's family physician. As with all reference
    resources, they reflect the best understanding of the science
    of medicine at the time of publication, but they should be used
    with the clear understanding that continued research may result
    in new knowledge and recommendations.</small></p>
