    <h3>Medical Ethics Commitee, British Medical Association,<br />

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The British Medical Association
      issued this guidance for its members on 4 April 2003. The BMA
      revised this statement in June 2006 with the addition of
      additional language regarding the possible unlawfulness of
      non-therapeutic circumcision in the United Kingdom. That
      additional language is shown in <span

      <h2>The law &amp; ethics of male circumcision - guidance for
      doctors</h2>

      <p><a id="aim" name="aim"></a><span class="1">Aim of the
      guidelines</span></p>

      <p>One of the BMA's roles is to issue guidance to doctors on
      ethical and medico-legal issues. Accordingly, this guidance
      addresses the queries medical practitioners raise with the
      BMA about both therapeutic and non-therapeutic[<a
      href="#n1">1</a>] male circumcision. The two procedures raise
      different issues. It does not cover circumcision carried out
      by non-medical practitioners, but we note that there may be
      no requirement in law for these practitioners to have proven
      expertise. Nor does the guidance address female genital
      mutilation, that is sometimes referred to as female
      circumcision.[<a href="#n2">2</a>]</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Circumcision of male babies and
      children at the request of their parents is an increasingly
      controversial area and strongly opposing views about
      circumcision are found within society and within the BMA's
      membership.</span> The medical evidence about its health
      impact is equivocal.</p>

      <p>As with any aspect of medical practice, doctors must use
      their skills in a way that promotes their patients'
      interests. They must act within the boundaries of the law and
      their own conscience, and weigh the benefits and harms of
      circumcision for the particular child. This guidance outlines
      good practice and safeguards which the BMA believes doctors
      should follow in the circumcision of male babies and
      children.</p>

      <p>The General Medical Council has also issued advice on
      circumcision,[<a href="#n3">3</a>] and advocates similar
      safeguards to those suggested here.</p>

      <p><a id="principles" name="principles"></a><span
      class="1">Principles of good practice</span><br />
       - The welfare of child patients is paramount and doctors
      must act in the child's best interests.<br />
       - Children who are able to be express views about
      circumcision should be involved in the decision-making
      process.<br />
       - Consent for circumcision is valid only where the people
      (or person) giving consent have the authority to do so and
      understand the implications and risks.<br />
       - Both parents[<a href="#n4">4</a>] must give consent for
      non-therapeutic circumcision.<br />
       - Where people with parental responsibility for a child
      disagree about whether he should be circumcised, doctors
      should not circumcise the child without the leave of a
      court.<br />
       - As with all medical procedures, doctors must act in
      accordance with good clinical practice and provide adequate
      pain control and aftercare.<br />
       - Doctors must make accurate, contemporaneous notes of
      discussions, consent, the procedure and its aftercare.</p>

      <p><a id="medical" name="medical"></a><span
      class="1">Circumcision for medical purposes</span><br />
       Unnecessarily invasive procedures should not be used where
      alternative, less invasive techniques, are equally efficient
      and available. It is important that doctors keep up to date
      and ensure that any decisions to undertake an invasive
      procedure are based on the best available evidence.
      Therefore, to circumcise for therapeutic reasons where
      medical research has shown other techniques to be at least as
      effective and less invasive would be unethical and
      inappropriate.</p>

      <p>Male circumcision in cases where there is a clear clinical
      need is not normally controversial. Nevertheless, normal
      anatomical and physiological characteristics of the infant
      foreskin have in the past been misinterpreted as being
      abnormal. <span class="yellow">The British Association of
      Paediatric Surgeons advises that there is rarely a clinical
      indication for circumcision.</span>[<a href="#n5">5</a>]
      Doctors should be aware of this and reassure parents
      accordingly.</p>
      If there is doubt about whether treatment is needed, or what
      is the most appropriate course of management, specialist
      advice should be sought. It is recommended that circumcision
      for medical purposes must only be performed by or under the
      supervision of doctors trained in children's surgery in
      premises suitable for surgical procedures.[<a
      href="#n6">6</a>] 

      <p><a id="non" name="non"></a><span class="1">Non-therapeutic
      circumcision</span><br />
       Male circumcision that is performed for any reason other
      than physical clinical need is termed non-therapeutic (or
      sometimes "ritual") circumcision. Some people ask for
      non-therapeutic circumcision for religious reasons, some to
      incorporate a child into a community, and some want their
      sons to be like their fathers. Circumcision is a defining
      feature of some faiths.</p>

      <p>There is a spectrum of views within the BMA's membership
      about whether non-therapeutic male circumcision is a
      beneficial, neutral or harmful procedure or whether it is
      superfluous, <span class="yellow">and whether it should ever
      be done on a child who is not capable of deciding for
      himself.</span> The medical harms or benefits have not been
      unequivocally proven except to the extent that there are
      clear risks of harm if the procedure is done inexpertly. The
      Association has no policy on these issues. Indeed, it would
      be difficult to formulate a policy in the absence of
      unambiguously clear and consistent medical data on the
      implications of the intervention. As a general rule, however,
      the BMA believes that parents should be entitled to make
      choices about how best to promote their children's interests,
      and it is for society to decide what limits should be imposed
      on parental choices. What those limits currently are is
      discussed below, together with the legal and ethical
      considerations for doctors asked to perform non-therapeutic
      circumcision.</p>

      <p><a id="law" name="law"></a><span class="2">The
      law</span></p>

      <p><span class="strike">It is presently generally accepted
      that non-therapeutic circumcision is lawful.</span> <span
      class="green">Male circumcision is not grounded in statute,
      however judicial review assumes that, provided both parents
      consent, non-therapeutic male circumcision is
      lawful.</span></p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Even when violence is intentionally afflicted and
          results in actual bodily harm, wounding or serious bodily
          harm the accused is entitled to be acquitted if the
          injury was a foreseeable incident of a lawful activity in
          which the person injured was participating. Surgery
          involves intentional violence resulting in actual or
          sometimes serious bodily harm but surgery is a lawful
          activity. Other activities carried on with consent by or
          on behalf of the injured person have been accepted as
          lawful notwithstanding that they involve actual bodily
          harm or may cause serious bodily harm. Ritual
          circumcision, tattooing, ear-piercing and violent sports
          including boxing are lawful activities".[<a
          href="#n7">7</a>]</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>This comment was made in passing by a judge considering a
      case about the extent to which a person could consent to
      physical interference by another and was relied on by a judge
      in a subsequent case considering the religious circumcision
      of a 5 year old boy whose parents disagreed.[<a
      href="#n8">8</a>] In that case the judge concluded that "as
      an exercise of joint parental responsibility, male ritual
      circumcision is lawful". <span class="green">This approach
      was followed by the Court of Appeal in the case of Re S.[<a
      href="#n9">9</a>] Following divorce a Muslim mother applied
      for permission for her 8 year old son to be circumcised. The
      son&rsquo;s father opposed and the opposition was held on the
      basis that the mother&rsquo;s application stemmed from the
      mother&rsquo;s need to portray herself as a practicing Muslim
      rather than the son&rsquo;s best interests.[<a
      href="#n10">10</a>]</span></p>

      <p><span class="strike">The lawfulness of the procedure is
      challenged by some, however,</span> <span
      class="green">Despite the common law assumption that,
      provided both parents consent, the procedure is lawful, the
      legality is not uncontroversial and has been challenged by
      some.</span> [<a href="#n11">11</a>] <span class="green">To
      end all doubt,</span> in the mid-1990s the English Law
      Commission said that although in its view ritual circumcision
      is lawful, law reform to "put the lawfulness of ritual male
      circumcision beyond any doubt" would be useful.[<a
      href="#n12">12</a>] This, however, has not been
      forthcoming.</p>

      <p><span class="green">With the exception of <i>Re
      S</i>,</span> these legal cases were heard before the
      implementation of the <a
      href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm#aofs"
      target="_blank">Human Rights Act</a> which, in 2000,
      incorporated Articles of the European Convention on Human
      Rights [<a href="#n13">13</a>] into UK law. Doctors must
      consider whether their decisions impact on a person's human
      rights and, if so, whether the interference can be justified.
      Rights that might be relevant to non-therapeutic circumcision
      include:<br />
       - Article 3: "No one shall be subjected to torture or to
      inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment"<br />
       - Article 5(1): "Everyone has the right to liberty and
      security of the person"<br />
       - Article 8: "Everyone has the right to respect for his
      private and family life" except for the "protection of health
      or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms
      of others"<br />
       - Article 9(1): "Everyone has the right to freedom of
      thought, conscience and religion"<br />
       - Article 9(2): "Freedom to manifest one's religion or
      beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are
      prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society
      in the interests of public safety, for the protection of
      public order, health or morals, <span class="yellow">or for
      the protection of the rights and freedoms of
      others</span>"</p>

      <p>Many aspects of good practice &ndash; including careful
      assessment of best interests, balancing conflicting rights
      and consulting with patients and their families &ndash; have
      taken on added importance as a result of the Human Rights
      Act, which makes them a required part of the decision-making
      process. As yet, the full impact of the Act on medical
      decision making is not known, and the rights in the Act are
      used by commentators to both support and reject
      non-therapeutic circumcision. One reason why it is not clear
      where the balance of rights lies is that the medical evidence
      is equivocal. Some argue that circumcision is a relatively
      neutral procedure, that, competently performed, carries
      little risk but can confer important psychosocial benefits.
      Others argue that circumcision has, or can have, profound and
      long-lasting adverse effects on the person who has been
      circumcised. If it was shown that circumcision where there is
      no clinical need is prejudicial to a child's health and
      wellbeing, it is likely that a legal challenge on human
      rights grounds would be successful. Indeed, if damage to
      health were proven, there may be obligations on the state to
      proscribe it. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child,
      which has been ratified by the UK, requires ratifying states
      to "take all effective and appropriate measures with a view
      to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health
      of children".[<a href="#n17">17</a>] At present, however, the
      medical evidence is inconclusive.</p>

      <p><a id="summary" name="summary"></a><span
      class="2">Summary: the law</span><br />
       Male circumcision is generally assumed to be lawful provided
      that:<br />
       - it is performed competently;<br />
       - it is believed to be in the child's best interests;
      and<br />
       - there is valid <a href="#consent">consent</a>.</p>

      <p>The <a
      href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm#aofs"
      target="_blank">Human Rights Act</a> may affect the way
      non-therapeutic circumcision is viewed by the courts. There
      has been no reported legal case involving circumcision since
      the Act came into force. <span class="yellow">If doctors are
      in any doubt about the legality of their actions, they should
      seek legal advice.</span></p>

      <p><a id="consent" name="consent"></a><span class="2">Consent
      and refusal</span><br />
       Consent for any procedure is valid only if the person or
      people giving consent understand the nature and implications
      of the procedure. To promote such an understanding of
      circumcision, parents and children should be provided with
      up-to-date written information about the risks. The BMA is
      concerned that they may not have easy access to up-to-date
      information, however, and has called on appropriate bodies
      such as the <a href="http://www.rcpch.ac.uk/"
      target="_blank">Royal College of Paediatrics and Child
      Health</a> and the <a href="http://www.baps.org.uk/"
      target="_blank">British Association of Paediatric
      Surgeons</a> to produce an information leaflet.</p>

      <p><a id="children" name="children"></a><span
      class="2">Children's own consent</span></p>

      <p>All children who are capable of expressing a view should
      be involved in decisions about whether they should be
      circumcised, and their wishes taken into account. <span
      class="yellow">The BMA cannot envisage a situation in which
      it is ethically acceptable to circumcise a competent,
      informed young person who consistently refuses the
      procedure.</span> As with any form of medical treatment,
      doctors must balance the harms caused by violating a child's
      refusal with the harm caused by not circumcising. <span
      class="yellow">Often surgery for non-medical reasons is
      deferred until children have sufficient maturity and
      understanding to participate in the decision about what
      happens to their bodies, and those that are competent to
      decide are entitled in law to give consent for
      themselves.</span> When assessing competence to decide,
      doctors should be aware that parents can exert great
      influence on their child's view of treatment. That is not to
      say that decisions made with advice from parents are
      necessarily in doubt, but that it is important that the
      decision is the child's own independent choice.</p>

      <p><a id="parents" name="parents"></a><span
      class="2">Parents' consent</span></p>

      <p>Where children cannot decide for themselves, their parents
      usually choose for them. Although they usually coincide,
      <span class="yellow">the interests of the child and those of
      the parents are not always synonymous.</span> There are,
      therefore, limits on parents' rights to choose and parents
      are not entitled to demand medical procedures contrary to
      their child's <a href="#best">best interests</a>.</p>

      <p>The BMA and GMC have long recommended that consent should
      be sought from both parents. Although parents who have
      parental responsibility are usually allowed to take decisions
      for their children alone, <span
      class="yellow">non-therapeutic circumcision has been
      described by the courts as an "important and irreversible"
      decision that should not be taken against the wishes of a
      parent.</span>[<a href="#n12">12</a>] It follows that where a
      child has two parents with parental responsibility, doctors
      considering circumcising a child must satisfy themselves that
      both have given valid consent. If a child presents with only
      one parent, the doctor must make every effort to contact the
      other parent in order to seek consent. If parents disagree
      about having their child circumcised, the parent seeking
      circumcision could seek a court order authorising the
      procedure which would make it lawful, although doctors are
      advised to consider carefully whether circumcising against
      the wishes of one parent would be in the child's best
      interests. Where a child has only one parent, obviously that
      person can decide.</p>

      <p>In all cases, doctors should ask parents to confirm their
      consent in writing by signing a consent form.</p>

      <p><span class="2">Summary: consent and refusal</span><br />
       - Competent children may decide for themselves.<br />
       - The wishes that children express must be taken into
      account.<br />
       - If parents disagree, non-therapeutic circumcision must not
      be carried out without the leave of a court.<br />
       - Consent should be confirmed in writing.</p>

      <p><a id="best" name="best"></a><span class="2">Best
      interests</span></p>

      <p>In the past, circumcision of boys has been considered to
      be either medically or socially beneficial or, at least,
      neutral. The general perception has been that no significant
      harm was caused to the child and therefore with appropriate
      consent it could be carried out. <span class="yellow">The
      medical benefits previously claimed, however, have not been
      convincingly proven, and it is now widely accepted, including
      by the BMA, that this surgical procedure has medical and
      psychological risks.</span> It is essential that doctors
      perform male circumcision only where this is demonstrably in
      the best interests of the child. <span class="yellow">The
      responsibility to demonstrate that non-therapeutic
      circumcision is in a particular child's best interests falls
      to his parents.</span></p>

      <p>It is important that doctors consider the child's social
      and cultural circumstances. Where a child is living in a
      culture in which circumcision is required for all males, the
      increased acceptance into a family or society that
      circumcision can confer is considered to be a strong social
      or cultural benefit. Exclusion may cause harm by, for
      example, complicating the individual's search for identity
      and sense of belonging. Clearly, assessment of such
      intangible risks and benefits is complex. On a more practical
      level, some people also argue that it is necessary to
      consider the effects of a decision not to circumcise. If
      there is a risk that a child will be circumcised in
      unhygienic or otherwise unsafe conditions, doctors may
      consider it better that they carry out the procedure, or
      refer to another practitioner, rather than allow the child to
      be put at risk.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, very similar arguments are also used to
      try and justify very harmful cultural procedures, such as
      female genital mutilation or ritual scarification.
      Furthermore, the harm of denying a person the opportunity to
      choose not to be circumcised must also be taken into account,
      together with the damage that can be done to the individual's
      relationship with his parents and the medical profession if
      he feels harmed by the procedure.</p>

      <p>The BMA identifies the following as relevant to an
      assessment of best interests in relation to non-therapeutic
      circumcision:<br />
       - the patient's own ascertainable wishes, feelings and
      values;<br />
       - the patient's ability to understand what is proposed and
      weigh up the alternatives;<br />
       - the patient's potential to participate in the decision, if
      provided with additional support or explanations;<br />
       - the patient's physical and emotional needs;<br />
       - the risk of harm or suffering for the patient;<br />
       - the views of parents and family;<br />
       - the implications for the family of performing, and not
      performing, the procedure;<br />
       - relevant information about the patient's religious or
      cultural background; and<br />
       - the prioritising of options which maximise the patient's
      future opportunities and choices.[<a href="#n13">13</a>]</p>

      <p>The BMA is generally very supportive of allowing parents
      to make choices on behalf of their children, and believes
      that neither society nor doctors should interfere
      unjustifiably in the relationship between parents and their
      children. It is clear from the list of factors that are
      relevant to a child's best interests, however, that <span
      class="yellow">parental preference alone is not sufficient
      justification for performing a surgical procedure on a
      child.</span></p>

      <p>The courts have also identified some factors that are
      important in a decision about circumcision. J was a 5 year
      old boy who lived with his mother, a non-practising
      Christian. His father, a non-practising Muslim, wanted him to
      be circumcised. Asked to decide whether J should be
      circumcised, the Court considered all the factors relevant to
      J's upbringing and concluded that J should not be circumcised
      because of three key facts:<br />
       - he was not, and was not likely to be, brought up in the
      Muslim religion;<br />
       - he was not likely to have such a degree of involvement
      with Muslims as to justify circumcising him for social
      reasons; and as a result of these factors,<br />
       - the "small but definite medical and psychological risks"
      of circumcision outweighed the benefits of the procedure.[<a
      href="#n14">14</a>]</p>

      <p><a id="bestsum" name="bestsum"></a><span
      class="2">Summary: best interests</span><br />
       - Doctors must act in the best interests of the
      patient.<br />
       - Even where they do not decide for themselves, <span
      class="yellow">the views that children express are important
      in determining what is in their best interests.</span><br />
       - The BMA does not believe that parental preference alone
      constitutes sufficient grounds for performing a surgical
      procedure on a child unable to express his own view. Parental
      preference must be weighed in terms of the child's
      interests.<br />
       - The courts have confirmed that the child's lifestyle and
      likely upbringing are relevant factors to take into account.
      The particular situation of the case needs to be
      considered.<br />
       - Parents must explain and justify requests for
      circumcision, in terms of the child's interests.</p>

      <p><a id="health" name="health"></a><span class="2">Health
      issues</span></p>

      <p>There is significant disagreement about whether
      circumcision is overall a beneficial, neutral or harmful
      procedure. At present, the medical literature on the health,
      including sexual health, implications of circumcision is
      contradictory, and often subject to claims of bias in
      research. Doctors performing circumcisions must ensure that
      those giving consent are aware of the issues, including the
      risks associated with any surgical procedure: pain, bleeding,
      surgical mishap and complications of anaesthesia. All
      appropriate steps must be taken to minimise these risks. It
      may be appropriate to screen patients for conditions that
      would substantially increase the risks of circumcision, for
      example haemophilia.</p>

      <p>Doctors should ensure that any parents seeking
      circumcision for their son in the belief that it confers
      health benefits are fully informed of the lack of consensus
      amongst the profession over such benefits, and how great any
      potential benefits and harms are. <span class="yellow">The
      BMA considers that the evidence concerning health benefit
      from non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this
      alone to be a justification for doing it.</span></p>

      <p><a id="standards" name="standards"></a><span
      class="2">Standards</span></p>

      <p>Doctors unfamiliar with circumcision who are asked about
      it should seek advice about the physical risks from doctors
      experienced in conducting circumcisions. Religious and
      cultural organisations may be able to give advice and suggest
      practitioners who perform circumcisions. It may be necessary
      to refer a family to a paediatric surgeon, urologist or other
      doctor experienced in performing the operation for advice and
      care.</p>

      <p>Poorly performed circumcisions have legal implications for
      the doctor responsible. An action could be brought against
      the doctor responsible on the child's behalf if the
      circumcision was carried out negligently. <span
      class="yellow">Alternatively, the child could issue such
      proceedings in his own name on reaching the age of 18 and the
      normal time limit for starting legal proceedings would run
      from that birthday.</span> However, unless the lawfulness of
      circumcision itself is successfully challenged, action cannot
      currently be taken against a doctor simply because a man is
      unhappy about having been circumcised at all. A valid consent
      from a person authorised to give it on the patient's behalf
      is legally sufficient in such cases. It goes without saying
      that a health professional who is not currently registered
      must never give the impression of so being even though there
      is no legal requirement for non-therapeutic circumcision to
      be undertaken by a registered health professional.</p>

      <p>The General Medical Council does not prohibit doctors from
      performing non-therapeutic circumcision, although would take
      action if a doctor was performing such operations
      incompetently. The Council explicitly advises that doctors
      must "have the necessary skills and experience both to
      perform the operation and use appropriate measures, including
      anaesthesia, to minimise pain and discomfort".[<a
      href="#n15">15</a>]</p>

      <p><a id="facilities" name="facilities"></a><span
      class="2">Facilities</span></p>

      <p>Doctors must ensure that the premises in which they are
      carrying out circumcision are suitable for the purpose. In
      particular, if general anaesthesia is used, full
      resuscitation facilities must be available.</p>

      <p><a id="charging" name="charging"></a><span
      class="2">Charging patients</span></p>

      <p>Although circumcision is not a service which is provided
      free of charge, some doctors and hospitals have been willing
      to provide circumcision without charge rather than risk the
      procedure being carried out in unhygienic conditions. In such
      cases doctors must still be able to justify any decision to
      circumcise a child based on the considerations above.</p>

      <p><a id="objector" name="objector"></a><span
      class="2">Conscientious objection</span></p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Some doctors may refuse to perform
      non-therapeutic circumcisions for reasons of conscience.
      Doctors are under no obligation to comply with a request to
      circumcise a child.</span> If doctors are asked to circumcise
      a child but have a conscientious objection, they should
      explain this to the child and his parents. Doctors may also
      explain the background to their conscientious objection if
      asked.</p>

      <p>Clearly where patients or parents request a medical
      procedure, doctors have an obligation to refer on promptly if
      they themselves object to it (for example termination of
      pregnancy). <span class="yellow">Where the procedure is not
      therapeutic but a matter of patient or parental choice, there
      is arguably no ethical obligation to refer on.</span> The
      family is, of course, free to see another doctor and some
      doctors may wish to suggest an alternative practitioner.</p>

        <li><a id="n4" name="n4"></a>The term "parents" is used in
        these guidelines to indicate holders of parental
        responsibility. Both of a child's parents have parental
        responsibility if they were married at the time of the
        child's conception, or at some time thereafter. Neither
        parent loses parental responsibility if they divorce. If
        the parents have never married, only the mother
        automatically has parental responsibility. The father may
        acquire it in various ways, including by entering into a
        parental responsibility agreement with the mother, or
        through a parental responsibility order made by a court.
        Additionally in Northern Ireland, fathers who are named on
        the child's birth certificate (from 15 April 2002 onwards)
        automatically have parental responsibility. Similar
        arrangements will apply in England and Wales once the
        relevant provisions of the <a
        href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2002/20020038.htm"
        target="_blank">Adoption and Children Act 2002</a> come
        into force. At the time of writing, there is no definite
        timescale for this. Scotland has also indicated its
        intention to introduce theses arrangements. Information
        about any changes will be put on the BMA's website. Clearly
        where a child has only one parent with parental
        responsibility, that person is responsible for decision
        making, although his or her views may not be
        determinative.</li>
