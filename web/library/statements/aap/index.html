      <h3>Committee on Fetus and Newborn</h3>

      <h2>Report of the Ad Hoc Task Force on Circumcision</h2>
      <br />
       
      <hr size="1" />
      <br />

      <p class="text2">The Committee on Fetus and Newborn of the
      American Academy of Pediatrics stated in <a
      href="/library/statements/aap/#1971">1971</a> that <span
      class="yellow">there are no valid medical indications for
      circumcision in the neonatal period.</span> <span
      class="yellow">The present committee has undertaken a review
      of data to support arguments "pro" and "con" circumcision of
      the newborn, and finds no basis for changing this
      statement.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Nevertheless, traditional, cultural, and
      religious factors play a role in the decision made by
      parents, pediatrician, obstetrician, or family practitioner
      on behalf of a son. It is the responsibility of the physician
      to provide parents with factual and informative medical
      options regarding circumcision. The final decision is theirs,
      and should be based on true informed consent. It is
      advantageous for discussion to take place well in advance of
      delivery, when the capacity for clear response is more
      likely.</p>

      <p class="text2">The followup is a summary of factors
      relating to neonatal circumcision which may be presented to
      parents for their consideration before deciding on the
      procedure.</p>

      <h3 class="1975">PREVENTION OF PHIMOSIS</h3>

      <p class="text2">A diagnosis of phimosis cannot be made with
      assurance in the newborn period because the cleavage plane
      between the glans and the deep preputial layer of the penis
      is not well developed at birth. There is a real need for
      research which will improve diagnostic accuracy in this area.
      <span class="yellow">It therefore follows that "phimosis of
      the newborn" is not a valid medical indication for
      circumcision.</span> Circumcision performed later in life in
      the approximately in the 2% to 10% of male with true phimosis
      has the disadvantage of anesthetic risk and increased cost.
      Circumcision done after the newborn period should be
      performed when trauma to the genitalia is least likely to
      induce psychologic problems. (e. g., before the boy starts
      school)</p>

      <h3 class="1975">FACILITATION OF HYGIENE</h3>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision, properly performed, eliminates
      much of the need for careful penile hygiene. If circumcision
      is not elected, the necessity for lifelong penile hygiene
      should be discussed with the parents, preferably before birth
      of the infant. Factors such as climate, the social and
      emotional reaction of prospective parents to penile
      cleansing, and the ability to understand and facilitate good
      hygiene, etc. should be taken into account when recommending
      whether circumcision should be performed.</p>

      <h3 class="1975">CARE OF THE PENIS</h3>

      <p class="text2">There is evidence that carcinoma of the
      penis can be prevented by neonatal circumcision. There is
      also much evidence that optimal hygiene confers as much, or
      nearly as much protection. Although circumcision is an
      effective method of method of preventing penile carcinoma, a
      great deal of unnecessary surgery, with attendant
      complications would have to be done if circumcision were to
      be used as prophylaxis against this disease. Promulgation of
      the principles of adequate hygiene is an alternative
      prophylactic measure.</p>

      <h3 class="1975">CANCER OF THE PROSTATE</h3>

      <p class="text2">There is presently no convincing scientific
      evidence to substantiate the assertion that circumcision
      reduces the eventual incidence of cancer of the prostate.</p>

      <h3 class="1975">CANCER OF THE CERVIX</h3>

      <p class="text2">A review of existing literature indicates
      that noncircumcision is not of itself of primary etiologic
      significance in the development of cervical cancer in
      women.</p>

      <h3 class="1975">BALANITIS AND VENEREAL DISEASE</h3>

      <p class="text2">Balanitis, infection of the foreskin, is
      painful and occurs only in uncircumcised males. If this
      occurs, staged surgical corrections may be necessary - first
      a dorsal slit to allow inflammation to subside, and then a
      secondary circumcision. <span class="cirp">[CIRP note: This
      is inaccurate. Balanitis is infection of the glans. Posthitis
      is infection of the foreskin. Balanoposthitis is infection of
      both the glans and the foreskin. Circumcision leaves a
      foreskin remnant, which may partially cover the glans. Thus,
      any of these conditions may occur also in circumcised
      males.]</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Adequate studies to determine the
      relationship between circumcision and the incidence of
      venereal disease have not been performed.</p>

      <h3 class="1975">SURGICAL RISKS AND AFTERMATHS</h3>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision is a surgical procedure that
      requires careful aseptic technique, systemized postoperative
      observation, and evaluation after discharge from the
      hospital.</p>

      <p class="text2">The immediate hazards of circumcision of the
      newborn include local infection which may progress to
      septicemia, significant hemorrhage, and mutilation.
      Incomplete removal of the prepuce may result in phimosis.</p>

      <p class="text2">Neonatal circumcision predisposes to
      meatitis, which may lead to meatal stenosis. The incidence of
      this complication is unknown, since the diagnosis of "meatal
      stenosis is seldom made on objective grounds. Meatal stenosis
      is seldom, if ever, associated with hydronephrosis or other
      objective evidence of urinary tract obstruction, such as a
      diminished urinary flow rate. Meatitis undoubtedly results in
      painful urination, but "meatal stenosis appears benign except
      in rare instances.</p>

      <h3 class="1975">CONTRAINDICATIONS TO CIRCUMCISION</h3>

      <p class="text2">Prematurity, neonatal illness, any
      congenital anomaly (especially hypospadias), or bleeding
      problems are absolute contraindications to neonatal
      circumcision. The procedure is also contraindicated in the
      immediate neonatal period or until complete neonatal physical
      adaption has occurred (usually 12 to 24 hours). The avoidance
      of circumcision in the delivery room is particularly
      important because neonatal disease is not always apparent at
      birth. In addition, it entails protracted exposure of infants
      to <a href="/library/complications/spence1/">significant cold
      stress</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="1975">CONCLUSIONS</h3>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">There is no absolute
      medical indication for routine circumcision of the
      newborn.</span> The physician should provide parents with
      information pertaining to the long-term medical effects of
      circumcision and non-circumcision, so they may make a
      thoughtful decision. It is recommended that this discussion
      take place before the birth of the infant, so the parental
      consent to the surgical procedure, if given, will be truly
      informed.</p>

      <p class="text2">A program of education leading to continuing
      good personal hygiene would offer all the advantages of
      circumcision without the attendant surgical risk. Therefore,
      circumcision of the newborn cannot be considered an essential
      component of adequate total health care.</p>

        <h3>THE PRENATAL PERIOD</h3>

        <p>Parents should seek consultation with their pediatrician
        prior to their infant's birth and participate in parent
        education classes. Members of the medical and nursing
        staffs who communicate effectively a nd are aware of the
        needs and anxieties of expectant mothers and fathers should
        plan and conduct the education program. Classes and other
        educational material should be informal and include both
        demonstrations and an opportunity for personal
        participation. This is the time to discuss infant feeding,
        circumcision, the possible effect the pregnancy or new
        infant might have on an older sibling, and other concerns
        about the infant, the pregnancy or other aspects of family
        life.</p>

        <h4>Circumcision</h4>

        <p><span class="yellow">There are no medical indications
        for routine circumcisions, and the procedure cannot be
        considered an essential components of health
        care.</span><sup>7</sup> If an infant is circumcised, the
        procedure must be delayed until the infant is at least 24
        hours old and stable, without bleeding tendency or any
        other illness. Circumcision must never be done at time of
        delivery.</p>

        <h4>Skin Care of the Newly Born Infant</h4>

        <p><span class="yellow">The skin is a protective organ, and
        any break in its integrity affords an opportunity for
        initiation of infection.</span> In addition, it is clear
        that protection against invading pathogenic organisms is
        afforded by skin secretions or contents and, in older
        infants by the normal skin biota. At birth the infant does
        not have protective skin flora, has at least one and,
        later, possibly two open surgical wounds (the umbilicus and
        the circumcision site), and is exposed to fomites and
        personnel that harbor a variety of infectious agents.</p>

      href="/library/statements/aap/#1971">1971</a> edition of
      <i>Standards and Recommendations of Hospital Care of Newborn
      Infants</i> by the Committee on the Fetus and Newborn of the
      American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) stated that "there are
      no valid medical indications for circumcision in the neonatal
      period."<sup><a href="#s1">1(p110)</a></sup> In <a
      href="/library/statements/aap/#1975">1975</a>, an Ad Hoc Task
      Force of the same committee reviewed this statement and
      concluded that "there is no absolute medical indication for
      routine circumcision of the newborn."<sup><a
      href="#s2">2</a></sup> The 1975 recommendation was reiterated
      in 1983 by both the AAP and the American College of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology in the jointly published
      <i>Guidelines to Perinatal Care</i>.<sup><a
      href="#s3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Large scale studies of US hospitals indicate
      that most male infants born in this country are circumcised
      in the newborn period,<sup><a href="#s4">4</a></sup> although
      the circumcision rate recently appears to be
      decreasing.<sup><a href="#s5">5</a></sup> Since the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap/#1975">1975 report</a>, new
      evidence has suggested possible medical benefits from newborn
      circumcision. Preliminary data suggest the incidence of
      urinary tract infection in male infants may be reduced when
      this procedure is performed during the newbornperiod. There
      is also additional published information<sup><a
      href="#s5">5</a></sup> concerning the relationship of
      circumcision to sexually transmitted diseases and, in turn,
      the relationship of viral sexually transmitted diseases to
      cancer of the penis and cervix.</p>

      <h3>DEFINITIONS, PENILE HYGIENE, AND LOCAL INFECTIONS</h3>

      <p class="text2">The penis consists of a cylindrical shaft
      with a rounded tip (the glans). The shaft and glans are
      separated by a groove called the coronal sulcus. The
      foreskin, or prepuce, is the fold of skin covering the glans.
      At birth, the prepuce is still developing histologically, and
      its separation from the glans is usually incomplete. Only
      about 4% of boys have a retractable foreskin at birth, 15% at
      6 months, and 50% at l year; by 3 years, the foreskin can be
      retracted in 80% to 90% of uncircumcised boys.<sup><a
      href="#s6">6</a></sup><span class="cirp">[CIRP note: the
      previous statement is based on inaccurate information. See <a
      href="/library/normal/">Normal</a> for the correct
      values.]</span> Phimosis is stenosis of the preputial ring
      with resultant inability to retract a fully differentiated
      foreskin. Paraphimosis is retention of the preputial ring
      proximal to the coronal sulcus, creating a tension greater
      than Iymphatic pressure resulting in subsequent edema of the
      prepuce and glans distal to the ring. Balanitis is
      inflammation of the glans, and posthitis is inflammation of
      the prepuce; these conditions usually occur together
      (balanoposthitis). Meatitis is inflammation of the external
      urethral meatus.</p>

      <p class="text2">Newborn circumcision consists of removal of
      the foreskin to near the coronal sulcus performed in early
      infancy (before age 2 months). The procedure prevents
      phimosis, paraphimosis, and balanoposthitis. Meatitis is more
      common in circumcised boys. There is no evidence that
      meatitis leads to stenosis of the urethral meatus.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is particularly important that
      uncircumcised boys be taught careful penile cleansing. As the
      boy grows, cleansing of the distal portion of the penis is
      facilitated by gently, never forcibly, retracting the
      foreskin only to the point where resistance is met. Full
      retraction may not be achieved until age 3 years or
      older.</p>

      <p class="text2">A small percentage of boys who are not
      circumcised as newborns will later require the procedure for
      treatment of phimosis, paraphimosis, or balanoposthitis. When
      performed after the newborn period, circumcision may be a
      more complicated procedure.<sup><a href="#s7">7</a></sup></p>

      <h3>CANCER OF THE PENIS</h3>

      <p class="text2">The overall annual incidence of cancer of
      the penis in US men has been estimated to be 0.7 to 0.9 per
      100,000 men and the mortality rate is as high as 25%.<sup><a
      href="#s8">8-11</a></sup> This condition occurs almost
      exclusively in uncircumcised men.<sup><a
      href="#s12">12-14</a></sup> In five major reported series
      since 1932, not one man had been circumcised
      neonatally.<sup><a href="#s11">11, 15-19</a></sup> The
      predicted lifetime risk of cancer of the penis developing in
      an uncircumcised man has been estimated at 1 in 600 men in
      the United States<sup><a href="#s20">20</a></sup>; in
      Denmark, the estimate is 1 in 909 men.<sup><a
      href="#s21">21</a></sup> in developed countries where
      neonatal circumcision is not routinely performed, the
      incidence of penile cancer is reported to range from 0.3 to
      1.1 per 100,000 men per year <sup><a href="#s4">4</a></sup>.
      This low incidence is about half that found in uncircumcised
      US men, but greater than that in circumcised US men.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Factors other than
      circumcision are important in the etiology of penile
      cancer.</span> The incidence of penile cancer is related to
      hygiene. In developing nations with low standards of hygiene,
      the incidence of cancer of the penis in uncircumcised men is
      3 to 6 per 100,000 men per year<sup><a
      href="#s22">22</a></sup>. The decision not to circumcise a
      male infant must be accompanied by a lifetime commitment to
      genital hygiene to minimize the risk of penile cancer
      developing. <span class="yellow">Recently, human
      papillomavirus types 16 and 18 DNA sequences have been found
      in 31 of 53 cases of penile cancer, suggesting the importance
      of these viruses in the development of this
      condition.</span><sup><a href="#s23">23</a></sup> Poor
      hygiene, lack of circumcision, and certain sexually
      transmitted diseases all correlate with the incidence of
      penile carcinoma.</p>

      <h3>URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS</h3>

      <p class="text2">A 1982 series of infants with urinary tract
      infections noted that males preponderated, contrary to the
      female preponderance later in life, and that 95% of the
      infected boys were uncircumcised.<sup><a
      href="#s24">24</a></sup> Beginning in 1985, studies conducted
      at US Army hospitals involving more than 200,000 men showed a
      greater than tenfold increase in urinary tract infections in
      uncircumcised compared with circumcised male infants;
      moreover, as the rate of circumcision declined throughout the
      years, the incidence of urinary tract infection
      increased.<sup><a href="#s5">5,25</a></sup> In another army
      hospital study, infants were examined in the first month of
      life and it was concluded that the high incidence of urinary
      tract infection in uncircumcised boys was accompanied by a
      similarly increased incidence of other significant infection,
      including bacteremia and meningitis<sup><a
      href="#s26">26</a></sup>; however, the authors of that study
      did not distinguish between bacteriuria secondary to
      septicemia and primary urinary tract infection. Still another
      recent army hospital study lends support to a 1986 hypothesis
      that circumcision prevents preputial bacterial colonization
      and thus protects male infants against urinary tract
      infection.<sup><a href="#s27">27,28</a></sup> <span
      class="yellow">It should be noted that these studies in army
      hospitals are retrospective in design and may have
      methodologic flaws.</span> For example, they do not include
      all boys born in any single cohort or those treated as
      outpatients, so the study population may have been influenced
      by selection bias.</p>

      <h3>SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES</h3>

      <p class="text2">Evidence regarding the relationship of
      circumcision to sexually transmitted diseases is conflicting.
      Early series indicated a higher risk of gonococcal and
      nonspecific urethritis in uncircumcised men,<sup><a
      href="#s29">29,30</a></sup> whereas one recent study shows no
      difference in the incidence of gonorrhea and a higher
      incidence of nonspecific urethritis in circumcised
      men.<sup><a href="#s31">31</a></sup> Although published
      reports suggest that chancroid, syphilis, human
      papillomavirus, and herpes simplex virus type 2 infection are
      more frequent in uncircumcised men, methodologic problems
      render these reports inconclusive.<sup><a
      href="#s29">29,30,32-34</a></sup></p>

      <h3>CERVICAL CARCINOMA</h3>

      <p class="text2">There appears to be a strong correlation
      between squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and sexually
      transmitted diseases. Human papillomavirus types 16 and 18
      are the viruses most commonly associated with cancer of the
      cervix <sup><a href="#s35">35-38</a></sup>; Herpes simplex
      virus type 2 has also been linked with cervical
      cancer.<sup><a href="#s36">36, 39</a></sup> Although human
      papillomavirus types 16 and 18 are also associated with
      cancer of the penis,<sup><a href="#s23">23,37</a></sup>
      evidence linking uncircumcised men to cervical carcinoma is
      inconclusive. The strongest predisposing factors in cervical
      cancer are a history of intercourse at an early age and
      multiple sexual partners. The disease is virtually unknown in
      nuns and virgins.</p>

      <h3>PAIN AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGES</h3>

      <p class="text2">Infants undergoing circumcision without
      anesthesia demonstrate physiologic responses suggesting that
      they are experiencing pain.<sup><a href="#s40">40</a></sup>
      The observed responses include behavioral, cardiovascular,
      and hormonal changes. Pain pathways as well as the cortical
      and subcortical centers necessary for pain perception are
      well developed by the third trimester. Responses to painful
      stimuli have been documented in neonates of all viable
      gestational ages. Behavioral changes include a cry pattern
      indicating distress during the circumcision procedure and
      changes in activity (irritability, varying sleep patterns)
      and in infant maternal interaction for the first few hours
      after circumcision.<sup><a href="#s41">4l-43</a></sup> These
      behavioral changes are transient and disappear within 24
      hours after surgery.<sup><a href="#s">43</a></sup></p>

      <h3>SURGICAL TECHNIQUES AND LOCAL ANESTHESIA</h3>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision is a safe surgical procedure if
      performed carefully by a trained, experienced operator using
      strict aseptic technique. The procedure should be performed
      only on a healthy, stable infant. Clamp techniques (eg, Gomco
      or Mogen clamps) or a Plastibell give equally good
      results.<sup><a href="#s44">44</a></sup> Techniques that may
      reduce postoperative complications include (1) using a
      surgical marking pen to mark the location of the coronal
      sulcus on the shaft skin preoperatively; (2) identifying the
      urethral meatus; (3) bluntly freeing the foreskin from the
      glans with a flexible probe; (4) completely retracting the
      foreskin; and (5) identifying the coronal sulcus, all before
      applying the clamp or Plastibell and before excising any
      foreskin.<sup><a href="#s45">45</a></sup> Electrocautery
      should not be used in conjunction with metal clamps. At the
      initial health supervision visit following hospital
      discharge, the penis should be carefully examined and the
      parents given instructions concerning ongoing care.</p>

      <p class="text2">Dorsal penile nerve block using no more than
      1cc lidocaine (without epinephrine) in appropriate doses (3
      to 4 mg/kg) may reduce the pain and stress of newborn
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#s41">41,46-49</a></sup> However,
      reported experience with local anesthesia in newborn
      circumcision is limited, and the procedure is not without
      risk (see "Complications").</p>

      <h3>CONTRAINDICATIONS, COMPLICATIONS, INFORMED CONSENT</h3>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision is contraindicated in an
      unstable or sick infant. Infants with genital anomalies,
      including hypospadias, should not be circumcised because the
      foreskin may later be needed for surgical correction of the
      anomalies. Appropriate laboratory studies should be performed
      when there is a family history of bleeding disorders. Infants
      who have demonstrated an uncomplicated transition to
      extrauterine life are considered stable. Signs of stability
      include normal feeding and elimination and maintenance of
      normal body temperature without an incubator or radiant
      warmer. A period of observation may allow for recognition of
      abnormalities or illnesses (eg, hyperbilirubinemia,
      infection, or manifest bleeding disorder) that should be
      addressed before elective surgery. It is prudent to wait
      until a premature infant meets criteria for discharge before
      performing circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">The exact incidence of postoperative
      complications is unknown,<sup><a href="#s50">50</a></sup> but
      large series indicate that the rate is low, approximately
      0.2% to 0 6%.<sup><a href="#s44">44,45,51,52</a></sup> The
      most common complications are local infection and bleeding.
      Deaths attributable to newborn circumcision are rare; there
      were no deaths in 500,000 circumcisions in New York
      City<sup><a href="#s52">52</a></sup> or in 175,000
      circumcisions in US Army hospitals.<sup><a
      href="#s51">51</a></sup> A communication published in 1979
      reported one death in the United States due to circumcision
      in 1973, and the authors' review of the literature during the
      previous 25 years documented two previous deaths due to this
      procedure.<sup><a href="#s53">53</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Complications due to local anesthesia are
      rare and consist mainly of hematomas and local skin
      necrosis.<sup><a href="#s41">41,46-49,54</a></sup> However,
      even a small dose of lidocaine can result in blood levels
      high enough to produce measurable systemic responses in
      neonates.<sup><a href="#s55">55,56</a></sup> Local anesthesia
      adds an element of risk and data regarding its use have not
      been reported in large numbers of cases. Circumferential
      anesthesia may be hazardous. It would be prudent to obtain
      more data from large controlled series before advocating
      local anesthesia as an integral part of newborn
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">When considering circumcision of their
      infant son, parents should be fully informed of the possible
      benefits and potential risks of newborn circumcision, both
      with and without local anesthesia. In addition to the medical
      aspects, other factors will affect the parents' decisions,
      including esthetics, religion, cultural attitudes, social
      pressures, and tradition.</p>

      <h3>SUMMARY</h3>

      <p class="text2">Properly performed newborn circumcision
      prevents phimosis, paraphimosis, and balanoposthitis and has
      been shown to decrease the incidence of cancer of the penis
      among US men. It may result in a decreased incidence of
      urinary tract infection. However, in the absence of
      well-designed prospective studies. conclusions regarding the
      relationship of urinary tract infection to circumcision are
      tentative. An increased incidence of cancer of the cervix has
      been found in sexual partners of uncircumcised men infected
      with human papillomavirus. Evidence concerning the
      association of sexually transmitted diseases and circumcision
      is conflicting.</p>

      <p class="text2">Newborns circumcision is a rapid and
      generally safe procedure when performed by an experienced
      operator. It is an <span class="yellow">elective
      procedure</span> to be performed only if an infant is stable
      and healthy. Infants respond to the procedure with transient
      behavioral and physiologic changes.</p>

      <p class="text2">Local anesthesia (dorsal penile nerve block)
      may reduce the observed physiologic response to newborn
      circumcision. It also has its own inherent risks. However,
      reports of extensive experience or followup with the
      technique in newborns are lacking.</p>

      <p class="text2">Newborn circumcision has potential medical
      benefits and advantages as well as <span
      class="yellow">disadvantages and risks</span>. When
      circumcision is being considered, the benefits and risks
      should be explained to the parents and informed consent
      obtained.</p>

      <p>Extract:</p>

      <blockquote>
        It is emphasized that newborn circumcision is an <span
        class="yellow">elective procedure</span> to be performed at
        the request of the parents when the infant is
        physiologically and clinically stable. Because of the lack
        of hard scientific data, a firm recommendation for
        appropriate method of pain control was not provided. The
        AAP has recently convened a task force to review new
        information available since the writing of the Guidelines
        with the goal of making specific recommendations on this
        issue.
