        <br />
         STANDARDS OF CARE</u></h3>
      </center>
      &nbsp; 

      <p><u>INTRODUCTION</u></p>

      <p>This document provides an update of the position
      previously expressed by BAPS and published on the website at
      &lt;<a
      href="/library/statements/BAPS1997/">http://www.baps.org.uk/documents/Circ%20GMC.html</a>&gt;</p>

      <p align="justify">As identified in the above paper, most
      agencies with a professional or statutory responsibility for
      the surgical care of male children have exempted themselves
      from comment on religious circumcision.</p>

      <p align="justify">Discordant opinion surrounds the
      indications and need for, as well as the advisability of,
      this practice. The prevalence, however, and the likelihood of
      continuance of this operation is such that the BAPS believes
      recommendations on standards of care which apply to all
      operative procedures on children, also pertain to religious
      circumcision.</p>

      <p align="justify">Commentary on the procedure does not
      indicate approval or disapproval of the practice but has the
      advocacy of the wellbeing of the child as its prime
      intent.</p>

      <p align="justify">The following are basic tenets of care to
      which adherence is mandatory, irrespective of the status of
      the individual performing the circumcision.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Appropriate expertise in performance of the
        procedure</li>

        <li>Sterility</li>

        <li>Analgesia</li>

        <li>Sedation</li>

        <li>Ability to identify co-morbidity</li>

        <li>Recognition of complications and access to medical
        care</li>
      </ul>

      <p><u>THE OPERATOR</u></p>

      <p align="justify">The person performing the procedure must
      be trained to do so and must be competent to provide the
      components of care defined above.</p>

      <p><u>STERILITY</u></p>

      <p align="justify">Any technique using incisional methods
      should be accompanied by preparatory skin disinfection using
      a proprietary standardised preparation, e.g. Chlorhexidine
      solution. Sterile technique must be used.</p>

      <p><u>ANALGESIA</u></p>

      <p align="justify">Circumcision should not be performed
      without using some form of anaesthetic.</p>

      <p align="justify">Regional infiltration of local anaesthetic
      or sparing application of topical anaesthetics should be used
      for peri-operative pain relief if general anaesthesia is not
      to be used.</p>

      <p align="justify">Familiarity with the techniques, agents
      and dosages involved is a pre-condition of use.
      Post-operative analgesia using proprietary analgesics such as
      Paracetamol should be routine.</p>

      <p align="justify"><u>SEDATION</u></p>

      <p align="justify">The choice of agents for sedating young
      children can only be made safely by experienced doctors.
      Sedation in childhood, particularly in infancy, is
      potentially hazardous and unpredictable. It is not
      appropriate to use sedative techniques in a community setting
      or in any other location where there is no immediate access
      to resuscitation equipment, nor should parenteral
      administration of any drug, local anaesthetic or medication
      be undertaken without such access.</p>

      <p><u>CO-MORBIDITY</u></p>

      <p align="justify">The responsible individual should attempt
      to identify any potentially adverse clinical
      contra-indications to circumcision. Examples include a family
      history of bleeding disorder, a child with significant past
      medical history, a child who is currently unwell, children
      under active clinical review for serious cardiac renal or
      respiratory disease, or those boys with a congenital
      abnormality of the penis such as hypospadias. In these
      circumstances, verification of the safety of the circumcision
      must be obtained from a specialist surgeon.</p>

      <p><u>COMPLICATIONS AND ACCESS TO HOSPITAL CARE</u></p>

      <p align="justify">Before operating, prior provision must be
      made for ready access to an appropriate hospital facility in
      the event of a complication arising either during or
      following circumcision. Attempts to treat any complication
      sustained in a community setting should be accompanied by
      prompt hospital referral.</p>

      <p><u>CONSENT FOR OPERATION</u></p>

      <p align="justify">Any person performing religious
      circumcision is strongly advised to comply with the GMC
      guidelines outlining the need for <u>both</u> parents to
      provide consent for surgery. (GMC: Standards of practice: <a
      href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/library/guidance_circumcise.asp"

      circumcise male children</a>. Sept.1997.)</p>
