                        size="3">Until recently, only public health
                        and religious views were taken into
                        consideration in the debate over infant
                        male circumcision. However, our
                        understanding of medical practice must
                        change as research findings become
                        available. The College of Physicians and
                        Surgeons of British Columbia is issuing
                        this guide for physicians regarding routine
                        infant male circumcision in light of
                        evidence-based medicine and contemporary
                        principles in ethics, law and human
                        rights.<br />
                        <br />
                         Infant male circumcision was once
                        considered a preventive health measure and
                        was therefore adopted extensively in
                        Western countries. Current understanding of
                        the benefits, risks and potential harm of
                        this procedure, however, no longer supports
                        this practice for prophylactic health
                        benefit. Routine infant male circumcision
                        performed on a healthy infant is now
                        considered a non-therapeutic and medically
                        unnecessary intervention. From a religious
                        standpoint, infant male circumcision is
                        acknowledged to be an important ritual and
                        an integral part of Jewish and Islamic
                        religions. Male circumcision is also
                        practiced in other parts of the world as a
                        rite of puberty.<br />
                        <br />
                         A wider societal discussion on infant male
                        circumcision is warranted based on a
                        current understanding of bioethics that
                        takes into account the non-therapeutic
                        nature of the procedure as well as the high
                        importance it plays in religious and
                        traditional customs. This paper provides a
                        discussion on current medical perspectives
                        as well as relevant legal, human rights,
                        and ethical considerations.<br />
                        <br />
                         <b>Medical Perspectives</b><br />
                        <br />
                         Circumcision removes the prepuce that
                        covers and protects the head or the glans
                        of the penis. The prepuce is composed of an
                        outer skin and an inner mucosa that is rich
                        in specialized sensory nerve endings and
                        erogenous tissue. Circumcision is painful,
                        and puts the patient at risk for
                        complications ranging from minor, as in
                        mild local infections, to more serious such
                        as injury to the penis, meatal stenosis,
                        urinary retention, urinary tract infection
                        and, rarely, even haemorrhage leading to
                        death. The benefits of infant male
                        circumcision that have been promoted over
                        time include the prevention of urinary
                        tract infections and sexually transmitted
                        diseases, and the reduction in risk of
                        penile and cervical cancer. Current
                        consensus of medical opinion, including
                        that of the Canadian and American
                        Paediatric Societies and the American
                        Urological Society, is that there is
                        insufficient evidence that these benefits
                        outweigh the potential risks. That is,
                        routine infant male circumcision, i.e.
                        routine removal of normal tissue in a
                        healthy infant, is not recommended.<br />
                        <br />
                         <b>Legal Considerations</b><br />
                        <br />
                         To date, the legality of infant male
                        circumcision has not been tested in the
                        Courts. It is thus assumed to be legal if
                        it is performed competently, in the child's
                        best interest, and after valid consent has
                        been obtained.<br />
                        <br />
                         At all times the physician must perform
                        the procedure with competence, and at all
                        times, the parent and physician must act in
                        the best interests of the child. Signed
                        parental consent for any treatment is
                        assumed to be valid if the parent
                        understands the nature of the procedure and
                        its associated risks and benefits. However,
                        proxy consent by parents is now being
                        questioned. Many believe it should be
                        limited to consent for diagnosis and
                        treatment of medical conditions, and that
                        it is not relevant for non-therapeutic
                        procedures.<br />
                        <br />
                         <b>Human Rights Considerations</b><br />
                        <br />
                         The matter of infant male circumcision is
                        particularly difficult in regards to human
                        rights, as it involves consideration of the
                        rights of the infant as well as the rights
                        of the parents.<br />
                        <br />
                         Under the <a
                        href="http://canada.justice.gc.ca/loireg/charte/const_en.html#juridiques"
                         target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights
                        and Freedoms</a> and the <a
                        href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-human/"
                         target="_blank">United Nations Universal
                        Declaration of Human Rights</a>, an infant
                        has rights that include security of person,
                        life, freedom and bodily integrity. Routine
                        infant male circumcision is an unnecessary
                        and irreversible procedure. Therefore, many
                        consider it to be "unwarranted mutilating
                        surgery".<br />
                        <br />
                         Many adult men are increasingly concerned
                        about whether their parents had the right
                        to give consent for infant male
                        circumcision. They claim that an infant's
                        rights should take priority over any
                        parental rights to make such a decision.
                        This procedure should be delayed to a later
                        date when the child can make his own
                        informed decision. <span
                        class="yellow">Parental preference alone
                        does not justify a non-therapeutic
                        procedure.</span><br />
                        <br />
                         Others argue that this stance violates the
                        parents' right to religious or cultural
                        expression, and that adherence to their
                        religious and cultural practices would be
                        in the best interests of the infant.<br />
                        <br />
                         <b>Ethical Considerations</b><br />
                        <br />
                         <span class="yellow">Ethical
                        considerations regarding infant male
                        circumcision centre on the welfare (or
                        "best interests") of the infant and the
                        potential benefit and harm associated with
                        the procedure. Ethics points us to
                        corrective vision, i.e. to question
                        practices that have become routine, or
                        which we take for granted.</span><br />
                        <br />
                         Therefore, each request for the procedure
                        should be carefully evaluated, and an
                        agreement to perform the procedure should
                        take into consideration the ethical
                        principles of beneficence (duty to
                        benefit); non-maleficence (do no harm);
                        veracity (accurate information); autonomy
                        (consent); and justice (fairness).<br />
                        <br />
                         These principles are articulated in
