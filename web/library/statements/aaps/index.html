        <h3>GUIDELINES FOR CIRCUMCISION</h3>
      </div>

      <p>Preamble: The Australasian Association of Paediatric
      Surgeons does not support the routine circumcision of male
      neonates, infants or children in Australia. It is considered
      to be inappropriate and unnecessary as a routine to remove
      the prepuce, based on the current evidence available.</p>

      <p>Due to religious beliefs, Jewish children are circumcised
      by the seventh day of life, as a mark of dedication to God.
      [sic] Children born into the Muslim faith will likewise be
      circumcised for religious reasons, although the timing for
      the procedure is less clearly defined. There are Christian
      groups in other parts of the world, who insist on ritual
      religious circumcision, as well as tribal or cultural customs
      promoting male circumcision.</p>

      <p>We do not support the removal of a normal part of the
      body, unless there are definite indications to justify the
      complications and risks which may arise. In particular, we
      are opposed to male children being subjected to a procedure,
      which had they been old enough to consider the advantages and
      disadvantages, may well have opted to reject the operation
      and retain their prepuce.</p>

      <p>Indications for male circumcision:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Balanitis Xerotica Obliterans<br />
         Recurrent Balanoposthitis<br />
         Phimosis resistant to steroid cream
      </blockquote>

      <p>Contraindications to male circumcision:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Hypospadias and other congenital anomalies of the penis,
        e.g. epispadias, chordee.<br />
         Sick and unstable infants<br />
         Family history of a bleeding disorder or an actual
        bleeding disorder.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Timing of surgery:</p>

      <p>Neonatal male circumcision has no medical indication. It
      is a traumatic procedure performed without anaesthesia to
      remove a normal functional and protective prepuce. At birth,
      the prepuce has not separated from the underlying glans and
      must be forcibly torn apart to deliver the glans, prior to
      removal of the prepuce distal to the coronal groove.</p>

      <p>Balantitis Xerotica Obliterans, when diagnosed, should be
      treated by circumcision.</p>

      <p>Timing of circumcision for recurrent balanoposthitis is
      difficult to define. Many infants and children will have an
      episode of preputial inflammation. If successive occurrences
      of dysuria with associated redness and purulent discharge
      from beneath the prepuce have been treated and the previously
      fully or partially retractable prepuce is less readily
      retractable after the subsidence of the inflammation,
      circumcision should be considered.</p>

      <p>The physiological phimosis will normally resolve by the
      age of 3-4 years. If it fails to respond to steroid
      cream/ointment applied several times daily for 4-6 weeks,
      there is a reasonable probability that these boys will have
      problems in the future.</p>

      <p>Infants and children who have a proven urinary tract
      infection and, on investigation, are found to have a
      significant urinary tract anomaly, e.g. posterior urethral
      valves or significant vesico-ureteric reflux, may benefit
      from circumcision. This will reduce the normal bacterial
      flora resident under the prepuce, which in the presence of a
      urinary tract anomaly may be associated with an increased
      risk of further upper tract infections with possible local
      and systemic damage.</p>

      <p>The risk of carcinoma of the penis developing in the
      uncircumcised is very low. Lifetime penile hygiene is the key
      to penile health and a reduction in the incidence of
      carcinoma of the penis.</p>

      <p>Personal sexual behavior patterns will determine whether
      sexually transmitted infections with human papilloma virus,
      herpes simplex virus and the human immune deficiency virus
      are contracted. Routine or infant male circumcision is not
      justified in Australia to protect males from contracting
      diseases that some may acquire through their ignoring the
      recognized precautions to be taken during their sexually
      active life.</p>

      <p>Consent for surgery: Parents requesting circumcision of
      their male children should have the complications both
      general and local, explained to them. These complications are
      usually minor but can be severe and may result in the death
      of the child. Time should also be spent discussing the
      advantages and disadvantages of the operation, both in the
      short and long term, as is currently applicable in Australia.
      There are many adults in the community who hold a very strong
      opinion as to the place of circumcision. This may be for
      religious reasons or for family "custom" or a claim of
      "cleanliness" or other reasons. In this event the procedure
      should be performed electively after six months of age. When
      performed, it should be carried out by a surgeon performing
      circumcisions on children on a regular basis with an
      anaesthetist using appropriate techniques. This would imply
      that the anaesthetist is fully trained in the art of
      paediatric anaesthesia, including the ability to perform
      caudal and penile regional or local anaesthesia. The
      operation should be carried out in a paediatrically
      orientated environment, designed to reduce the risk to the
      child and providing support to the parents or caregivers.</p>

      <p>Points of Interest:</p>

      <p>Marshall in 1960, reporting to the Society of Pediatric
      Urologists in Philadelphia and quoted by John Duckett, a
      distinguished pediatric urologist in Philadelphia, calculated
      that 140 boys a week for 24 weeks would need to be
      circumcised to prevent one case of carcinoma of the
      penis.</p>

      <p>The Jewish Talmud stated that "the third child was excused
      from circumcision if the first two had died as a result of
      the circumcision".</p>

      <p>Dr. Derek Llewellyn in his book "Everywoman" published by
      Faber and Faber Limited in 1971, stated that "Mothers demand
      it, doctors profit by it and babies cannot complain about
      it".</p>

      <p>The <a href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">1989 United
      Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> states that
      "State parties should take all effective and appropriate
      measures with a view to abolishing traditional practices
      prejudical to the health of children."</p>

      <p>"Circumcision of male infants" was addressed in a <a
      href="/library/legal/QLRC/">research paper</a> published by
      the Queensland Law Reform Commission in December 1993. The
      preface addresses the problem when it states "From the
      Commission's research to date, it is apparent that there are
      two quite vocal sides of the debate on routine male
      circumcision. One side advocates the practice, primarily on a
      preventative health basis or on religious grounds. The other
      side opposes the practice, primarily on human rights and
      preservation of bodily integrity grounds. Both sides rely on
      medical evidence and opinion to support their respective
      views". Having considered all the information the paper
      concludes with "The Commission has yet to decide what, if any
      reform of the law should be recommended in relation to infant
      male circumcision."</p>
