      <p align="center">POSITION STATEMENT</p>

      <p>The Australian College of Paediatrics has prepared the
      following statement on routine circumcision of infants and
      boys to assist parents who are considering having this
      procedure undertaken in their male children and for doctors
      who are asked to advise on or undertake it.</p>

      <p align="center">ROUTINE CIRCUMCISION OF NORMAL MALE INFANTS
      AND BOYS</p>

      <p>Circumcision of males has been undertaken for religious
      and cultural reasons for many thousands of years. It probably
      originated as a hygiene measure in communities living in hot
      and dry environments. It remains a very important ritual in
      some religious/cultural groups.</p>

      <p>During the last 50-100 years, neonatal male circumcision
      became widespread in English-speaking countries. Until the
      late 1960s or early 1970s, it was generally performed without
      any form of anaesthesia. In Australia, the circumcision rate
      has fallen very considerably in recent years and it is
      estimated that currently only 10 percent of male infants are
      routinely circumcised. It is now generally performed with
      some form of local or general anesthesia.</p>

      <p>There have been increasing claims of health benefits from
      routine male circumcision. There are, however, also risks
      associated with the procedure from infection, bleeding and
      damage to the glans penis. The College has recently reviewed
      evidence in relation to risks and benefits and has concluded
      that it is not possible to be dogmatic on the exact
      risk/benefit ratio. There are suggestions of reductions in
      the risk of urinary tract infections, of local inflammatory
      conditions of the penis and later cancer of the penis. It has
      also been claimed that there is a reduction in the risk of
      sexually transmitted disease (especially HIV) and of cancer
      of the cervix in partners of circumcised males. However,
      studies claiming these benefits do have methodological
      problems which could influence findings and these problems
      will be difficult to overcome. Therefore, at the present time
      it would be wrong either to claim that there are definite
      health benefits or to deny that they exist.</p>

      <p>The possibility that <a
      href="/library/legal/smith/">routine circumcision may
      contravene human rights</a> has been raised because
      circumcision is performed on a minor and is without proven
      medical benefit. Whether these legal concerns are valid will
      probably only be known if the matter is determined in a court
      of law.</p>

      <p>The <a href="../aaps/">Australasian Association of
      Paediatric Surgeons</a> has informed the College that it is
      its view that routine male circumcision should not be
      performed prior to the age of 6 months. It considers that
      <span class="yellow">"Neonatal male circumcision has no
      medical indication. It is a traumatic procedure performed
      without anaesthesia to remove a normal and healthy
      prepuce."</span></p>

      <p>The College believes informed discussion with parents
      regarding the possible health benefits of routine male
      circumcision and the <a href="/library/complications/">risks
      associated with the operation</a> are essential. Up-to-date,
      unbiased written material summarising the evidence in plain
      English should be widely available to parents.</p>

      <p>If the operation is to be performed, the medical attendant
      should ensure this is done by a competent operator, using
      appropriate anaesthetic techniques and under medical
      conditions that minimise the hazards.</p>

      <p>In the majority of cases, parents will decide for or
      against a routine male circumcision on family, social,
      aesthetic and religious grounds rather than on medical ones.
      In all cases the medical attendant should avoid exaggeration
      of either benefits or risks of this procedure.</p>
