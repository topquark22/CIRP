            <p class="heading1"><b>Routine Circumcision of Normal Male Infants 
            and Boys - Summary Statement</b></p>
 
            <p>The Paediatrics and Child Health Division, Royal
            Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) has prepared
            this statement on routine circumcision of infants and
            boys assist parents who are considering having this
            procedure undertaken on their male children and for
            doctors who are asked to advise on or undertake it.
            After extensive review of the literature the RACP
            reaffirms that <b>there is no medical indication for
            routine male circumcision.</b></p>

            <p>Circumcision of males has been undertaken for
            religious and cultural reasons for many thousands of
            years. It remains an important ritual in some religious
            and cultural groups. In Australia and New Zealand, the
            circumcision rate has fallen considerably in recent
            years and it is estimated that currently only 10
            percent of male infants are routinely circumcised. It
            is now generally performed with some form of local or
            general anaesthesia, and usually outside the neonatal
            period. The best recognised indication for circumcision
            is phimosis.</p>

            <p>There have been increasing claims over recent years
            of health benefits from routine male circumcision. The
            most important other conditions where some benefit may
            result from circumcision are urinary tract infections,
            HIV and later cancer of the penis.</p>
<ul>
            <li>Urinary tract infections in boys are uncommon,
            affecting at most 1%-2%, and may be about 5 times less
            frequent in circumcised boys, whilst circumcision has a
            complication rate of 1% to 5%. Routine neonatal
            circumcision can not be supported as a public health
            measure on this basis.</li> 

            <li>While there is some evidence,
            particularly from sub-Saharan Africa, that male
            circumcision reduces the risk of acquisition of HIV,
            evidence is conflicting and clearly this can not be
            seen as an argument in favour of universal neonatal
            circumcision in countries with a low prevalence of HIV.</li>

            <li>Penile cancer is a rare disease with an incidence of
            around 1 per 100,000 in developed countries. Even
            though the evidence suggests neonatal circumcision may
            reduce the risk 10-fold, <span>the rarity of the
            condition is such that universal circumcision is
            clearly not justified on these grounds.</span></li>
</ul>
            <p>The complication rate of neonatal circumcision is
            reported to be around 1% to 5% and includes local
            infection, bleeding and damage to the penis. <span>Serious
            complications such as bleeding, septicaemia and
            meningitis may occasionally cause death.</span></p>

            <p>The possibility that <a href="/library/legal/smith/"
            target="_blank">routine circumcision may contravene
            human rights</a> has been raised because circumcision
            is performed on a minor and is without proven medical
            benefit. Whether these legal concerns are valid will be
            known only if the matter is determined in a court of
            law.</p>

            <p>If the operation is to be performed, the medical
            attendant should ensure this is done by a competent
            operator, using appropriate anaesthesia and in a safe
            child-friendly environment.</p>

            <p>In all cases where parents request a circumcision
            for their child the medical attendant is obliged to
            provide accurate information on the risks and benefits
            of the procedure. Up-to-date, unbiased written material
            summarising the evidence should be widely available to
            parents.</p>

            <p><span>Review of the literature in relation to risks and
            benefits shows there is no evidence of benefit
            outweighing harm for circumcision as a routine
            procedure.</span></p>

            <p class="heading1"><b>1. Recent Literature And Policy
            Statements</b></p>

            <p>There is an extensive literature on circumcision in
            general, and male neonatal circumcision in particular.
            This includes a number of books<sup><a
            href="#n1">1,2</a></sup> and recent reviews<sup><a
            href="#n3">3</a></sup> including those by the Canadian
            Paediatric Society (CPS)<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>
            and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)<sup><a
            href="#n5">5,6</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>The CPS recommended "<span>Circumcision of newborns
            should not be routinely performed</span>" (reaffirmed
            February 2001: (<a href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm" target="_blank">www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN</a>) and
            the AAP concluded "<span>we can not recommend a policy
            of routine newborn circumcision</span>".
            (<a href="http://www.aap.org/mrt/factscir.htm" target="_blank">www.aap.org/mrt/factscir.htm</a>).</p>

            <p>Following the present review of the evidence,
            <span>the RACP concurs with these statements</span> and
            endorses the 1996 statement of the <a
            href="/library/statements/acp1996/">Australian College
            of Paediatrics</a> (now the Division of Paediatrics and
            Child Health of RACP) and <a
            href="/library/statements/aaps/">Australasian
            Association of Paediatric Surgeons</a> that
            "<span>Neonatal male circumcision has no medical
            indication</span>".</p>

<p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: A "routine" procedure is one which is performed without medical indication.  The six medical societies have adopted the position of the Canadian Paediatric Society that "Circumcision of newborns
            should not be <i>routinely</i> performed." They also have adopted the position of the Australian College of Paediatrics and the Australasian Association of Paediatric Surgeons that "Neonatal male circumcision has <i>no</i> medical
            indication." In effect, therefore, they apparently are saying that circumcision of the newborn should <i>not</i> be done <i>at all</i>.]</p> 

            <p class="heading1"><b>2. History of Circumcision</b></p>

            <p>Circumcision of males has been undertaken for
            religious and cultural reasons for many thousands of
            years. It probably originated as a hygienic measure in
            communities living in hot, dusty and dry environments.
            It remains an important ritual in several religious and
            cultural groups.</p>

            <p>Medicalisation of male circumcision seems to have
            occurred in the 19<sup>th</sup> century in English
            speaking countries. Being circumcised was a sign that
            the individual had been delivered by a doctor rather
            than by a midwife<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>. Over
            the years, circumcision has been seen as a cure or
            preventative measure for all manner of conditions
            including paralysis, insanity, epilepsy, tuberculosis,
            enuresis, masturbation and phimosis, through to the
            contemporary claims for prevention of urinary tract
            infections in boys, and penile cancer and sexually
            transmitted diseases in adult males.</p>

            <p>During the last 50-100 years, routine neonatal male
            circumcision became widespread in many English speaking
            countries. Until the late 1960's or early 1970's, it
            was generally performed without any form of
            anaesthesia.</p>

            <p>The rates of circumcision vary from country to
            country, being about 60% in the USA (with recent data
            suggesting falling rates, particularly amongst the
            growing Hispanic population), 30% in Ontario, Canada,
            6% in the UK (rates fell when circumcision became
            unavailable on the NHS), and less than 2% in
            Scandinavia. Estimates for Australia range between
            10%-20% (most of which are now performed under a
            general anaesthetic in boys older than six months), and
            for New Zealand somewhat less than that. The procedure
            is more common in Pacific Island communities where
            traditional circumcisers are often used.</p>

            <p class="heading1"><b>3. Anatomy of the Foreskin</b></p>

            <p class="heading2"><b>3.1 Background</b></p>

            <p>The foreskin is a redundant fold of penile skin
            which overlaps the glans penis<sup><a
            href="#n7">7</a></sup>. It first appears at eight weeks
            of fetal life and soon grows forwards over the glans
            penis. By 16 weeks it covers the glans. At this stage
            the epidermis of the under-surface of the foreskin is
            continuous with the epidermis covering the glans. Both
            consist of squamous epithelium. The foreskin (prepuce)
            and glans penis enclose a potential cleft, the
            preputial sac. A preputial space is then formed by a
            process of desquamation, and the prepuce increasingly
            separates from the glans<sup><a
            href="#n8">8</a></sup>.</p>

            <p><span>At the time of birth this process is incomplete in
            the vast majority of boys, and the foreskin is
            non-retractable. Complete separation of the
            foreskin with full retractability occurs in almost all
            boys by the time of puberty</span><sup><a
            href="#n9">9</a></sup>.</p>

            <p class="heading2"><b>3.2 Care of the foreskin</b></p>

            <p>It is normal for the inner surface of the foreskin
            to be fused to the glans in newborn males. Separation
            of the foreskin from the glans occurs spontaneously
            during childhood. By five years of age most of boys are
            able to retract their foreskin<sup><a
            href="#n9">9</a></sup>. A small percentage of boys are
            unable to fully retract their foreskin until
            puberty.</p>

            <p>The foreskin requires no special care during
            infancy. <b>It should be left alone</b><sup><a
            href="#n10">10</a></sup>. Attempts to forcibly retract
            it are painful, often injure the foreskin, and can lead
            to scarring and phimosis.</p>

            <p>Later in childhood, the foreskin can be gently
            retracted to the point where resistance is met and the
            distal portion of the penis and the urethral meatus
            become visible. The glans and the inner-surface of the
            foreskin can be cleaned along with the rest of the body
            once separation has occurred and the foreskin is fully
            retractable<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>By around the time of puberty, all uncircumcised
            boys should be able to retract their foreskin and clean
            underneath it in the bath or shower. It is important
            that they always return the foreskin to its original
            position after they have finished. If the foreskin is
            left retracted behind the glans, it may swell up and
            become painful (paraphimosis).</p>

            <p>As the foreskin separates from the glans, dead skin
            cells will collect between the two layers. These dead
            cells appear as white crumbly or cheesy material and
            have been termed smegma. Smegma may produce a
            noticeable (and often asymmetrical) swelling beneath
            the foreskin. This material rarely causes problems and
            usually discharges spontaneously. Accumulation of
            smegma assists the normal process of separation of the
            inner surface of the foreskin to the glans of the penis
            in the young boy. Infection of smegma as it is released
            may cause inflammation.</p>

            <p>Although there is evidence that boys who are
            uncircumcised have a higher incidence of urinary tract
            infections, there is no evidence that the increased
            incidence of infection is due to poor hygiene.</p>

            <p class="heading1"><b>4. Medical Indications for
            Circumcision</b></p>

            <p class="heading2"><b>4.1 Phimosis</b></p>

            <p>Pathological phimosis, which needs to be
            distinguished from the normal non-retractile foreskin
            of early childhood<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>, is
            an indication for circumcision<sup><a
            href="#n13">13,14</a></sup>. The condition occurs in at
            least 1% of boys<sup><a href="#n15">15,16</a></sup>, is
            rare in the first five years of life and may be due to
            secondary cicatrisation of the foreskin due to
            balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO)<sup><a
            href="#n17">17,18</a></sup>. <span>Topical application
            of steroid ointment may resolve phimosis in the
            majority of boys</span><sup><a
            href="#n19">19,20</a></sup> except in those with BXO
            where steroids are rarely successful.</p>

            <p>Physiological phimosis (normal narrowing of the
            foreskin that may make visualisation of the glans
            difficult during infancy) will normally resolve by the
            age of three to four years and requires no treatment.
            If pathological (ie non-physiological) phimosis fails
            to respond to steroid cream/ointment applied to the
            tight part of the foreskin two to four times a day for
            two to six weeks, there is a reasonable probability
            that it will cause problems in the future and the child
            may well benefit from circumcision. In a proportion of
            boys the phimosis redevelops after cessation of
            applications of steroid treatment.</p>

            <p class="heading2"><b>4.2 Recurrent balanoposthitis</b></p>

            <p>Recurrent balanoposthitis is a relative indication
            for circumcision. The condition needs to be
            distinguished from the more benign ammoniacal
            dermatitis<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>.
            Balanoposthitis affects 3%-4% of boys, and is recurrent
            in about 1% of boys<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup>.
            Balanoposthitis and balanitis may also occur in adults.
            Diabetes may be a risk factor<sup><a
            href="#n22">22</a></sup>.</p>

            <p class="heading2"><b>4.3 Paraphimosis</b></p>

            <p>Recurrent paraphimosis is extremely rare and may
            represent a relative indication for circumcision. In
            children, the condition is usually secondary to
            forceful retraction of the foreskin and is associated
            with a minor degree of phimosis. In adults,
            paraphimosis typically occurs in the elderly. Men
            requiring frequent bladder catheterisation are
            particularly at risk<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup>.
            Treatment in children involves manipulation of the
            foreskin forwards over the glans, and requires some
            form of analgesia (general or local). In a minority of
            children, after reduction of paraphimosis circumcision
            may be required, if topical application of a steroid
            preparation fails to resolve the underlying phimosis,
            or if paraphimosis recurs.</p>

            <p class="heading1"><b>5. The Role of Circumcision In Preventing
            Other Conditions</b></p>

            <p class="heading2"><b>5.1 Urinary tract infections (UTIs)</b></p>

            <p>The cumulative incidence of UTI in boys by the age
            of about 10 is 1-2%<sup><a href="#n24">24,25</a></sup>.
            Ginsburg and McCracken<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup>
            first reported a higher incidence of UTIs in
            uncircumcised boys. This is biologically plausible
            because uropathogens have been shown to bind to the
            foreskin and then gain access to the renal tract via
            the ascending route: removal of the foreskin would
            abolish this mechanism. Other factors may be important
            in determining the prevalent organisms. For example,
            rooming in with mother may favour colonisation with
            non-pathogenic bacteria<sup><a
            href="#n4">4,27</a></sup>, and breast feeding has been
            associated with lower rates of UTI than bottle feeding
            in one brief report<sup><a
            href="#n28">28</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>There have now been ten case control and cohort
            studies published, which have evaluated the association
            between circumcision and UTIs<sup><a
            href="#n24">24,29-37</a></sup>, but no randomised
            controlled trials have been done. All have demonstrated
            a statistically significant reduction in risk of UTI in
            circumcised males compared with uncircumcised males,
            with most data concerning the risk of UTI during
            infancy. The magnitude of the reported protective
            effect varies from a three-fold reduction to a
            twelve-fold reduction in risk of UTI due to
            circumcision. These data may be used to assess possible
            benefits and harm from neonatal circumcision. Assuming
            an annual incidence of UTI of 1% during the first year
            of life for uncircumcised boys, the risk of UTI may be
            reduced from 10 per 1,000 to 1-3 per 1000, a difference
            of 7-9 per 1,000, or a need to circumcise between 110
            to 140 boys to prevent one UTI during the first year of
            life.</p>

            <p>On the other side of the equation, taking a
            mid-range figure of 2% (20 per 1,000) for major
            complications from circumcision, mainly from
            haemorrhage and infection (see earlier section), for
            every 1,000 infants circumcised, about eight fewer will
            develop a UTI but 20 will develop a significant
            complication. <span>Assuming that the
            "harm" of a UTI is about the same as a
            complication, routine circumcision is difficult to
            advocate as a public health measure.</span></p>

            <p>Other figures can be used to come to a different
            conclusion but even then many parents and caregivers
            would believe this should not be the only
            consideration<sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>The benefit-harm trade-off is also sensitive to the
            baseline risk of UTI. Assuming the same protective
            benefits of circumcision for the prevention of UTI
            extends to boys at higher risk of UTI, such as those
            with underlying renal tract abnormalities, then is it
            likely that a small group of boys, who continue to have
            symptomatic recurrent UTI despite conventional clinical
            care such as chemoprophylaxis, will benefit from
            circumcision. The risk of UTI in these boys is not 1%
            as it is in the general population, but closer to
            30%<sup><a href="#n39">39,40</a></sup> so that only 4-5
            boys would need to be circumcised to prevent UTI, or
            200-270 UTIs prevented for every 1000 circumcisions
            with about 20 complications.</p>

            <p><span>In summary, routine circumcision in boys
            cannot be justified on the basis of preventing a
            UTI.</span> On the other hand, there may be a role for
            circumcision in boys with recurrent symptomatic UTI
            and/or underlying renal tract abnormalities.</p>

            <p class="heading2"><b>5.2 Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)</b></p>

            <p>The published evidence concerning the relationship
            between circumcision and STD is often
            conflicting<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup>. An
            Australian study from 1983<sup><a
            href="#n42">42</a></sup> suggested herpes genitalis,
            candidiasis, gonorrhoea and syphilis were all more
            common in uncircumcised men. A more recent Australian
            study<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup> , however,
            suggested that circumcision has no significant effect
            on the incidence of common STD's. One study has
            suggested a higher risk of non-gonococcal urethritis
            among circumcised men than among uncircumcised
            men<sup><a href="#n44">44</a></sup>. Genital ulcer
            disease, on the other hand, has been reported as being
            more common among uncircumcised men, and those with a
            genital ulcer are more likely to contract HIV.</p>

            <p>There is increasing evidence, particularly from
            sub-Saharan Africa, which suggests an increased risk of
            female to male transmission of HIV in uncircumcised
            men<sup><a href="#n45">45-48</a></sup>. However, how
            much circumcision could contribute to ameliorate the
            current epidemic of HIV is uncertain<sup><a
            href="#n49">49</a></sup>. <span>Whatever the future
            direction of this debate it can not be seen as an
            argument in favour of universal neonatal circumcision
            in countries with a low prevalence of HIV.</span></p>

            <p class="heading2"><b>5.3 Human papilloma virus and carcinoma of the

            <p>A recent international study reported an increased

            compared with circumcised men<sup><a

            partners had six or more sexual partners and were
            circumcised had a lower risk of cervical cancer than
            women whose partners were uncircumcised. Public health
            measures aimed at early detection have been shown to
            decrease cervical cancer fatalities; targeting sexually
            promiscuous men to decrease risk taking and increase
            condom use may inhibit sexual transmission of HPV and
            prophylactic vaccination against HPV is being
            developed. <span>At present there are no data to

            <p class="heading2"><b>5.4 Carcinoma of the penis</b></p>

            <p>Carcinoma of the penis is a rare condition, with an

            developed countries, regardless of whether there is a
            high or a low circumcision rate<sup><a
            href="#n4">4,5</a></sup>. There is evidence that
            neonatal circumcision confers protection from carcinoma
            of the glans penis but not of the penis shaft<sup><a
            href="#n52">52-56</a></sup>. Even though the evidence
            suggests neonatal circumcision does reduce the risk of

            clearly not justified on these grounds</span><sup><a

            <p>Other risk factors for penile cancer include
            phimosis (which is limited to uncircumcised men),

            It has been hypothesised that good penile hygiene may

            <p class="heading1"><b>6. Complications of circumcision</b></p>

            <p>Apart from pain and distress, and the side effects
            of local anaesthesia, there have been many
            complications of circumcision reported<sup><a

            minor, but some can be more severe, such as penile
            amputation and even death. The overall reported rate of
            complications after circumcision varies between
            0.06%<sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup> to 55%<sup><a
            href="#n63">63</a></sup> depending on the situation in
            which it is performed and the precise definition of
            complication. Most series describe a complication rate
            of about 2%-10%<sup><a href="#n64">64-66</a></sup>. A
            detailed summary of complications has been provided by
            Williams and Kapila<sup><a href="#n61">61</a></sup>,

              <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haemorrhage<br /></li>
              <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infection<br /></li>

            <p>The true incidence of <b>major</b> complications

            problem is haemorrhage, and may indicate an underlying
            vitamin K deficiency or haemophilia. Infection is
            usually minor, but rarely septicaemia and meningitis
            may occur. Longer term complications include meatal
            stenosis, cutaneous tags, poor cosmetic appearance, and
            psychological trauma. Children with prominent prepubic
            fat may have a concealed penis following surgery which

            <p class="heading1"><b>7. Legal and Bioethical Issues</b></p>

            <p>The legal and bioethical issues surrounding male
            neonatal circumcision have been discussed in recent
            legal journal reviews<sup><a
            href="#n60">60,67</a></sup>. Parents have the right,
            indeed duty, to make informed medical decisions on
            behalf of their children. It is equally established in
            law that parents may not make decisions about their
            child's medical care when such a decision is not
            in the child's best interests. Many legal
            precedents exist to establish that Courts will deny
            parents the right to refuse medically indicated
            procedures required by their child that are contrary to
            their religious beliefs.</p>

            <p>The difficulty with a procedure which is not
            medically indicated is whether it may still be in the
            child's "best interests" (that is, in
            the case of circumcision, decreasing the risk of UTI
            and penile cancer, and ensuring acceptance within a
            religio-cultural group) on the one hand<sup><a
            href="#n60">60</a></sup> or whether it may constitute
            an assault upon the child and be a violation of human
            rights on the other<sup><a href="#n67">67</a></sup>.
            Arguments to justify the "best interests"
            case are based upon data to suggest a decreased risk of
            medical conditions later in life, none of which, with
            the possible exception of UTI's in boys, requires
            a decision in the neonatal period, and this could be
            seen to be an argument to defer a decision until the
            individual can express his own preferences. Generally
            the courts have avoided jurisdiction in this
            area<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup>. However, there
            has been a <a href="/library/legal/Re_J/">1999 UK
            case</a> where separated parents disagreed on the
            question of circumcision with the court finding
            circumcision not to meet the "paramountcy of
            welfare" standard and not be in the best
            interests of the child<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup>.
            One issue, which is agreed, is that before parents make
            a decision about circumcision they should have access
            to unbiased and clear information on the medical risks
            and benefits of the procedure. Whether this has always
            been the case in the past is uncertain, and many
            parents make such a decision on cultural and religious
            grounds alone<sup><a href="#n68">68</a></sup>.</p>

            <p class="heading1"><b>8. Analgesia</b></p>

            <p>Until recent times a majority of neonatal
            circumcisions were performed without analgesia. Stated
            justifications for not using analgesia include a belief
            that circumcision causes minimal pain, that rapid
            expert circumcision causes less pain than that
            engendered by local anaesthetic procedures and that
            newborns have no memory of pain. <span>There are good
            experimental data to refute the first two of these
            contentions and, even though the third suggestion can
            not be considered a sufficient reason to withhold
            analgesia, there is an emerging body of evidence to
            show that painful neonatal experiences do have long
            term consequences, even if not rooted in conscious
            memory</span><sup><a href="#n69">69</a></sup>. Taddio
            reported that circumcised boys had higher pain and cry
            scores during routine immunisation at 4-6 months of age
            than uncircumcised boys<sup><a href="#n70">70</a></sup>
            and scores were again higher if circumcision was
            unaccompanied by analgesia compared with those
            receiving topical anaesthesia<sup><a
            href="#n71">71</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>Newborn infants subjected to a variety of noxious
            stimuli have hormonal, physiological and behavioural
            responses<sup><a href="#n72">72</a></sup>. There have
            been <b>two recent consensus statements on the
            prevention and management of pain in the
            newborn</b><sup><a href="#n73">73,74</a></sup> which
            should be used to guide the clinical approach to
            analgesia for circumcision <i>if such an operation
            should be deemed necessary</i>. Both statements
            emphasise that compared with older age groups newborns
            may experience a greater sensitivity to pain, such pain
            may have long term consequences, and a lack of
            behavioural response (for example lack of crying) does
            not necessarily indicate a lack of pain.</p>

            <p>Whilst general anaesthesia will often be used for
            circumcision beyond the neonatal period it has rarely
            been considered as an option for newborn circumcision.
            Local or regional anaesthesia for newborn circumcision
            has been provided by local application of a eutectic
            mixture of local anaesthetics (EMLA cream), dorsal
            penile nerve block (DPNB), penile ring block (PRB) and
            caudal epidural block.</p>

            <p>Recent trials have demonstrated that combined
            analgesia and local anaesthesia (for example, pre- and
            post-operative paracetamol, EMLA cream to the abdomen
            and foreskin, oral sucrose, and DPNB or PRB<sup><a
            href="#n75">75</a></sup>), are more effective than
            either alone<sup><a href="#n74">74,76,77</a></sup>. In
            Australia, most circumcisions are undertaken in boys
            older than six months under a general anaesthetic, with
            local anaesthetic often being administered during the
            general anaesthetic.</p>

            <p class="heading1"><b>9. Technique of Circumcision</b></p>

            <p>When a circumcision is performed in an older child
            it is usually performed under general anaesthesia and
            regional block<sup><a href="#n78">78</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>There are numerous descriptions of circumcision but
            in most, the following steps are undertaken<sup><a
            href="#n78">78</a></sup>.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Any residual adhesions between the inner surface
              of the foreskin and the glans are separated until the
              coronal groove is fully exposed circumferentially.
              Any smegma is removed.</li>

              <li>The foreskin is returned to its normal position
              and a dorsal slit is made, stopping short of the
              coronal groove.</li>

              <li>A similar manoeuvre is performed on the ventral
              surface as far as the frenulum.</li>

              <li>The foreskin is excised around each side leaving
              a rim of inner surface adjacent to the coronal
              groove.</li>

              <li>The edges of the foreskin are retracted to enable
              haemostasis. Usually the vessels are ligated with
              absorbable suture, or diathermied.</li>

              <li>The edges of the foreskin are sutured around the
              circumference with interrupted absorbable
              sutures.</li>

              <li>No circumferential dressing is applied, because
              of the risk of making the glans ischaemic if swelling
              occurs.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Potential intraoperative problems include:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Removal of excessive skin</li>

              <li>Removal of inadequate skin</li>

              <li>Haemorrhage</li>

              <li>Injury to the urethra</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Early postoperative complications include bleeding,
