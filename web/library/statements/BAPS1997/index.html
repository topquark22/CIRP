        Paediatric Surgeons</font></p>

        <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica"
        size="4">concerning <i>Male Ritual
        Circumcision.</i></font></p>
      </center>

      <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica">These comments are
      made in response to the GMC document <i><a
      href="/library/statements/gmc/">'Draft guidance for doctors
      who are asked to perform circumcision on boys for religious
      or cultural reasons</a>'.</i></font></p>

      <ol>
        <li>The British Association of Paediatric Surgeons (<a
        href="http://www.baps.org.uk/" target="_blank">BAPS</a>)
        recognises that male circumcision is required in certain
        religious and cultural groups and that decisions concerning
        the legality or otherwise of performing the procedure must
        lie with society and be determined by Parliament. Not
        withstanding this, it is the majority opinion that the
        practice should be discouraged by education.</li>

        <li>The BAPS considered that the optimum circumstances for
        the procedure to be performed is in hospital under general
        anaesthesia, particularly in view of recent <a
        href="/library/pain/taddio/">research</a> regarding the
        long term effects of the pain endured. The Association
        considers that when the operation is performed by a doctor
        it should be carried out in hospital.</li>

        <li>The BAPS wish to see more precise statements regarding
        the phrase <i>'a good standard of care.'</i> (This would be
        less of an issue if all procedures were performed in
        hospital).</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <ul>
        <li>Where a practitioner is operating outside a hospital
        this activity must be registered with the Health Authority
        covering the geographical area.</li>

        <li>Before commencing operating, the practitioner must
        undergo, or demonstrate that he/she has undergone,
        appropriate training for the operation including attention
        to analgesia. (The BAPS does not consider local anaesthetic
        to be adequate but realises it is not in a position to
        legislate.) The practitioner must also undergo periodic
        retraining in the procedure.</li>

        <li>Any practitioner performing this operation must be in a
        position to provide all the necessary postoperative care
        should any complication arise.</li>

        <li><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica">The requirement
        of obtaining consent from both parents is often not
        practical. This is not done in hospital and should not be a
        requirement. However it should be pointed out that in
        certain circumstances it may be prudent so to do. Consent
        for surgery should also be obtained from a competent
        minor.</font></li>

        <li><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica">The BAPS do not
        agree that a practitioner <i>must</i> refer the patient to
        a colleague who will perform the operation. It may be
        appropriate in Primary Care for the doctor to make such a
        recommendation, but it should not be a requirement in
        Secondary Care. Moreover, it could be considered unethical
        for a hospital practitioner to make such a referral as this
        is the right of the general practitioner to chose to whom
        the patient is referred.</font></li>
