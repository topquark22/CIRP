        <h2>Circumcision Reference Library Summary</h2>
      </center>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP note: ACOG has not placed the actual
      text of their circumcision policy online. It is available on
      their website only to their members. Therefore, the
      Circumcision Reference Library has prepared this
      interpretation of ACOG's position, for readers who do not
      have access to a medical library.]</p>

      <p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
      (ACOG) released a position statement on neonatal
      circumcision, identified as "ACOG Committee Opinion Number
      260", in October, 2001. The statement may be summarized as
      follows:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Lack of medical value.</b> The statement affirms
        ACOG's agreement with and support of the 1999 American
        Academy of Pediatrics <a
        href="/library/statements/aap1999/">Circumcision Policy
        Statement</a>. From this it is clear that ACOG cannot and
        does not recommend elective non-therapeutic circumcision of
        infant boys for medical reasons or for any other
        reason.</p>

        <p><b>Complications.</b> ACOG admits that "common
        complications are local infections and bleeding", but fails
        to state that death may result therefrom. The statement
        does not mention surgical mishaps, which may result in
        serious injury.</p>

        <p><b>Pain.</b> Good ethical medical practice requires <a
        href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/re9945/">use
        of anesthetic agents</a> if a circumcision is to be
        performed. The <a
        href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/">pain of
        circumcision</a> is intense, excruciating, and longlasting.
        According to a recent <a
        href="http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/101/6/e5"
        target="_blank">study</a>, 75% of U.S. obstetricians (ACOG
        members) do not use any anesthesia for neonatal
        circumcision. ACOG admits that infants feel pain when
        someone is circumcising them. ACOG further admits that
        sucrose and acetominophen are "not sufficient" medication
        for this operation.</p>

        <p><b>Informed consent.</b> ACOG advises its members that
        parents (plural) should be given "accurate and impartial
        information" about circumcision. Even though ACOG does not
        recommend circumcision because of its lack of medical
        value, ACOG states that only infants who are already
        "healthy and stable" should be subjected to
        circumcision.</p>

        <p><b>Reference.</b> The complete original statement, which
        is brief, may be viewed in a medical library. The citation
        for the ACOG statement is:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>ACOG Committee Opinion Number 260: Circumcision.
          <cite>Obstet Gynecol</cite> 2001; 98(4):707-8.</li>
        </ul>
