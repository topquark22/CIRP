      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: This file contains extracts of
      the brief language regarding breastfeeding and neonatal
      circumcision that are taken from a much larger work on the
      care of the newborn. One notes that the classification of
      circumcision as an <i>elective procedure to be performed at
      the request of the parents</i> removes any suggestion that
      circumcision is medically recommended or that it is a normal
      part of hospital routine. In contrast, breastfeeding is
      highly recommended and apparently should be given
      priority.]</p>

      <h2>Antepartum care</h2>

      <h4>Support of Breastfeeding</h4>

      <p><span class="yellow">During prenatal visits the patient
      should be counseled regarding the nutritional advantages of
      human breast milk.</span> Human milk is the most appropriate
      nutrient for newborns and provides significant immunological
      protection against infection. Newborns who are breastfed have
      a decreased incidence of infection and require fewer
      hospitalizations than formula fed neonates. Women should be
      provided with information regarding available lactation
      consultation services and organizations (see
      &ldquo;Breastfeeding&rdquo; in Chapter 7).</p>

      <h4>Circumcision</h4>

      <p>The topic of newborn male circumcision should be
      discussed. <span class="yellow">Newborn circumcision is an
      elective procedure to be performed at the request of the
      parents, on newborn boys who are physiologically and
      clinically stable.</span> The American Academy of Pediatrics
      1999 Task Force suggests that existing scientific evidence
      demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male
      circumcision (eg, reduced incidences of phimosis, urinary
      tract infection, and penile cancer). <span
      class="yellow">However the data are not sufficient to
      recommend routine neonatal circumcision.</span> Appropriate
      anesthesia should be provided for the procedure (see
      &ldquo;Circumcision&rdquo; in Chapter 7).</p>
      <u>Page 205</u> 

      <h2>Care of the Neonate</h2>

      <h4>Circumcision</h4>

      <p>Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential
      medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; however, these
      data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal
      circumcision. The exact incidence of complications after
      circumcision is not known, but data indicate that the rate is
      low and that the most common complications are local
      infection and bleeding. Given this understanding, parents
      should make the determination in the interest of the neonate.
      To make an informed choice, the parents of all neonates
      should be given accurate and unbiased information on
      circumcision and be given an opportunity to discuss this
      decision. If circumcision is performed, analgesia should be
      provided. Swaddling, sucrose by mouth, and acetaminophen
      administration may reduce the stress response but are not
      sufficient for operative pain and cannot be recommended as
      the sole method of analgesia. Although local anesthesia and
      EMLA cream provides some anesthesia benefit, <span
      class="yellow">both ring blocks and dorsal penile blocks have
      proved more effective.</span></p>

      <p>The uncircumcised penis is easy to keep clean. The
      foreskin usually does not retract for several years and
      should not be forced. Gentle washing of the genital area
      while bathing is sufficient for normal hygiene. Later, when
      the foreskin is fully retractable, boys should be taught the
      importance of washing underneath the foreskin on a regular
      basis.</p>
