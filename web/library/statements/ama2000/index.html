      <h2>Neonatal Circumcision</h2>

      <p class="text1"><i>NOTE: This report represents the
      medical/scientific literature as of December 1999.</i></p>

      <p class="text1">Resolutions 505 and 507, introduced by the
      Medical Student Section and referred to the Board of Trustees
      at the 1998 Interim Meeting, asked: "That the American
      Medical Association (AMA) study and make recommendations on
      the issue of pain control during male infant circumcision;
      and that the AMA disseminate information to assist physicians
      in providing medical knowledge about <a

      neonatal male circumcision to parents."</p>

      <p class="text1">This report is confined to circumcisions
      that are not performed for ritualistic or religious purposes.
      <span class="yellow">In this case, the term "non-therapeutic"
      is synonymous with elective circumcisions that are still
      commonly performed on newborn males in the United

      <p><b>Methods</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Published studies from the years 1966 to
      July 1999 were identified through MEDLINE and Lexis/Nexis
      Medical Library searches of English-language articles using
      the key words "circumcision," "male," "adverse effects," and
      "pain control." Related articles in the MEDLINE database
      using the additional MeSH term "pain prevention &amp;
      control" also were identified. A total of 338 articles were
      retrieved. Additional articles were identified by manual
      review of the references cited in these publications.</p>

      <p><b>Background</b></p>

      <p class="text1">The normal uncircumcised penis consists of a
      cylindrical shaft and rounded tip (glans) that are separated
      by a tissue groove (coronal sulcus). The fold of skin (<a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/cold-taylor/">foreskin</a>)
      covering the glans is removed during the circumcision
      procedure to a point near the coronal sulcus. At birth,
      separation of the foreskin from the glans is incomplete. The
      separation process continues through childhood via
      desquamation and epidermal keratinization of the shaft.
      Keratinization does not occur on the mucosal surface of the
      foreskin, which may contain <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/taylor/">specialized
      sensory cells</a>. Eventually, unforced and complete
      retraction of the foreskin can be accomplished.</p>

      <p class="text1">The majority of newborn males in the United
      States are circumcised, although the percentage varies by
      location, religious affiliation, and socioeconomic
      classification. The prevalence of circumcision in the United
      States increased from about 30% in the 1930s to nearly 80% by
      the early 1970s. During this time frame, whites were more
      likely to be circumcised than blacks or Hispanics.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n1">1</a></sup>
      While the circumcision rate appeared to decline in the 1970s
      and early 1980s, rates of more than 80% were described in
      studies limited to Atlanta and US Army Hospitals.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n2">2-4</a></sup>
      Estimates based on the National Center for Health Statistics
      indicate that 61% and 65% of male infants were circumcised in
      the United States during 1987 and 1995, respectively.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n5">5,6</a></sup>
      Ritual circumcision is common in the Jewish and Islamic
      faiths, but uncommon altogether in Asia, South and Central
      America, and most of Europe.</p>

      <p class="text1">Based on recent <a
      href="http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/101/6/e5"
      target="_blank">survey</a> data, 54% of pediatricians, family
      practitioners, and obstetricians perform at least 1
      circumcision per month. Of physicians performing
      circumcision, 45% use anesthesia, most commonly dorsal penile
      block with lidocaine (71% of pediatricians, 56% of family
      practitioners, and 25% of obstetricians). Those physicians
      who reported not using anesthesia cited concern about adverse
      effects and a belief that circumcision does not warrant
      anesthesia.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>Current Specialty Society Recommendations</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Recent policy statements issued by
      professional societies representing <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/acp1996/">Australian</a>,
      <a
      href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm">Canadian</a>,
      and <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/">American</a>
      pediatricians do not recommend routine circumcision of male
      newborns.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n5">5,8-10</a></sup>
      The most recent statement by the American Academy of
      Pediatrics reads as follows: "Existing scientific evidence
      demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male
      circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to
      recommend routine neonatal circumcision. In circumstances in
      which there are potential benefits and risks, yet the
      procedure is not essential to the child's current well-being,
      parents should determine what is in the best interest of the
      child. To make an informed choice, parents of all male
      infants should be given accurate and unbiased information and
      be provided the opportunity to discuss this decision. If a
      decision for circumcision is made, procedural analgesia
      should be provided."</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="cirp">[CIRP note: A <i>potential benefit</i> is
        one that has been suggested, but which cannot be proved to
        actually exist. On the other hand, the risks,
        complications, disadvantages, adverse effects, and certain
        injury of circumcision are documented, real, and
        proved.]</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text1">This statement modifies the Academy's 1989
      conclusion that newborn male circumcision has "potential
      medical benefits and advantages as well as disadvantages and
      risks."<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n11">11</a></sup>
      The 1989 <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap/#1989">statement</a>
      by the Academy reversed a long-standing opinion that medical
      indications for routine circumcision were lacking. It emerged
      primarily on the basis of data that suggested circumcision
      caused a large reduction in the risk of urinary tract
      infections, particularly within the first year of life.</p>

      <p class="text1">In a joint publication with the American
      Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians
      and Gynecologists (ACOG) concluded in <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap/#1997">1997</a>
      that "newborn circumcision is an elective procedure to be
      performed at the request of the parents on baby boys who are
      physiologically and clinical stable."<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n12">12</a></sup>
      From the standpoint of ACOG's Practice Activities Division,
      as a surgical procedure with concomitant pain, the use of
      analgesia during circumcision is advocated, but the preferred
      mode of pain relief is not specified (Stanley Zinberg, MD.
      Personal communication. September 1999). The current clinical
      policy on neonatal circumcision contained in the American
      Academy of Family Physicians Reference Manual states:
      "Current medical literature regarding neonatal circumcision
      is controversial and conflicting&hellip;. The decision to
      perform neonatal circumcision should be based on the informed
      consent of the parents, and requires objective, factual
      counseling of parents by the family physician" (Available at:
      www.aafp.org/policy/camp/4.html). A 1995 Fact Sheet for
      physicians offered by the American Academy of Family
      Physicians is currently being revised.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n13">13</a></sup>
      The British Medical Association has a <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/general/BMJ/">longstanding
      recommendation</a> that circumcision should be performed only
      for medical reasons.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n14">14</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>Risk-Benefit Analysis of Circumcision</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Debate on the wisdom of routine circumcision
      centers on the possible benefits offered by circumcision, and
      whether they medically justify the risks associated with the
      procedure. Properly performed circumcision protects against
      the development of phimosis, paraphimosis in elderly men
      requiring intermittent or chronic bladder catheterization,
      and balanitis.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n5">5</a></sup>
      The only longitudinal <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/fergusson/">study</a>
      to address the former found a 4% incidence of phimosis in
      uncircumcised boys.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n15">15</a></sup>
      The medical benefits suggested to accrue from circumcision
      are reduced incidence of urinary tract infection in infant
      males, decreased incidence of penile cancer in adult males,
      and possibly decreased susceptibility to certain sexually
      transmissible diseases, including human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV).</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Urinary Tract Infection:</b> There is
      little doubt that the uncircumcised infant is at higher risk
      for urinary tract infection (UTI), although the magnitude of
      this risk is debatable. A meta-analysis of 9 studies
      published between 1984 and 1992 revealed a 12-fold increased
      risk of UTI in uncircumcised males.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n4">4</a></sup>
      Most of the studies analyzed were case-control designs that
      analyzed the rate of UTI in the first year of life. A more
      recent population-based cohort found a relative risk of 3.7
      for hospitalization for UTI in the first year of life in
      uncircumcised boys.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n16">16</a></sup>
      A similar relative risk (4.8) was detected in another
      case-control study.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n17">17</a></sup>
      The reliability of many studies examining circumcision status
      and UTI in infant males is weakened by lack of controls for
      potential confounders such as prematurity, extent of <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/statements/breastfeeding_statement2002.html"
       target="_blank">breastfeeding</a>, and the method of urine
      collection used to identify bacteriuria. Despite the
      increased relative risk in uncircumcised infants, the
      absolute incidence of UTI is small in this population
      (0.4%-1%).<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n18">18</a></sup>
      Depending on the model employed, approximately 100 to 200
      circumcisions would need to be performed to prevent 1
      UTI.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n16">16,19</a></sup>
      In this case, a large relative risk reduction translates into
      a small absolute risk reduction because the baseline
      prevalence is low. One <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/chessare/">model
      of decision analysis</a> concluded that the incidence of UTI
      would have to be substantially higher in uncircumcised males
      to justify circumcision as a preventive measure against this
      condition.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n20">20</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Penile Cancer:</b> Penile cancer is a
      rare disease in the United States (0.9 to 1 per 100,000).
      Among uncircumcised men the incidence is estimated to be
      2.2/100,000.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n21">21</a></sup>
      Six case series published between 1932 and 1986 found that
      all penile cancers occurred in uncircumcised
      individuals.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n11">11,22</a></sup>
      Results of one case control study provide an exception to
      this general rule, although circumcision status was
      determined by self-report.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n23">23</a></sup>
      Nevertheless, this study also found that the absence of
      neonatal circumcision increased the risk for penile cancer by
      a factor of 3.2 Other identified <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/vanhowe/">risk
      factors for penile cancer</a> are phimosis (occurring
      exclusively in uncircumcised males), genital warts, infection
      with <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/mccance/">human
      papilloma virus</a>, large number of sexual partners, and <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/hellberg1/">cigarette
      smoking</a>.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n23">23-25</a></sup>
      Nevertheless, because this disease is rare and occurs later
      in life, the use of circumcision as a preventive practice is
      not justified.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection
      and Sexually Transmissible Diseases:</b> The data on
      circumcision status and susceptibility to HIV infection and
      other sexually transmissible diseases have been recently
      reviewed.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n5">5,26,27</a></sup>
      Five of 7 prospective studies involving heterosexual
      transmission of HIV-1 found a statistically significant
      association between lack of circumcision and elevated risk
      for acquisition of HIV (relative risks 2.3-8.1). In the other
      2 studies the relative risk exceeded 3 in uncircumcised
      males, but a low proportion of uncircumcised men and a small
      percentage of seroconversion limited the statistical power of
      these studies.</p>

      <p class="text1">At least 16 studies have examined the
      relationship between circumcision and sexually transmissible
      diseases other than HIV.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n27">27</a></sup>
      In general, circumcised individuals appear to have somewhat
      lower susceptibility to acquiring chancroid and syphilis,
      possibly genital herpes, and gonorrhea compared to
      individuals in whom the foreskin is intact. The available
      data on <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/STD/smith/">nongonococcal
      urethritis</a> and <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/STD/cook2/">genital
      warts</a> are inconclusive. Regardless of these findings,
      behavioral factors are far more important risk factors for
      acquisition of HIV and other sexually transmissible diseases
      than circumcision status, and circumcision cannot be
      responsibly viewed as "protecting" against such
      infections.</p>

      <p><b>Complications of Circumcision</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Two large series detected a complication
      rate between 0.2% and 0.6% in circumcised infants.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n28">28,29</a></sup>
      Bleeding and infection, occasionally leading to sepsis, are
      the most common adverse events requiring treatment. In the
      majority of cases, bleeding is minor and hemostasis can be
      achieved by pressure application. Other untoward events can
      result from taking too much skin from the penile shaft
      causing <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/sotolongo1/">denudation</a>
      or rarely, concealed penis, or from not removing sufficient
      foreskin, producing an <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/vanhowe/">unsatisfactory
      cosmetic result</a> or recurrent phimosis.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n30">30,31</a></sup>
      Other postoperative complications include formation of skin
      bridges between the penile shaft and glans, meatitis and
      meatal stenosis, chordee, inclusion cysts in the circumcision
      line, lymphedema, hypospadias and epispadias, and urinary
      retention.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n32">32</a></sup>
      Case reports have associated circumcision with other rare but
      severe events including <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/annunziato1/">
      scalded skin syndrome</a>, <a
      href="http://www.seattlechildrens.org/surgery/exstroph/fourn.htm">
      necrotizing fasciitis</a>, sepsis and <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/scurlock1/">meningitis</a>,
      <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/baskin/">urethrocutaneous
      fistulas</a>, necrosis (secondary to cauterization), and <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/gluckman/">partial
      amputation of the glans penis</a>.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n5">5,30,32</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>Provision of Anesthesia During Circumcision</b></p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="text1"><b>Ordinary humanitarian sentiment
          prevents consideration of circumcision without
          anesthesia. It is perfectly true that millions of infants
          have been circumcised while entirely conscious, and no
          subsequent evil has befallen them; I do not believe,
          however, that any physician would rend a mother's heart
          by so tormenting her babe. It is specious to hold that an

      <p class="text1">Clinical and biochemical evidence indicates
      that newborn infants exhibit physiological, autonomic, and
      behavioral responses to noxious stimuli. Acute responses of
      neonates to painful stimuli include large increases in <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/williamson/">heart
      rate</a>, increased blood pressure, <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/rawlings1/">decreased

      changes</a>, and <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/gunnar/">increases in
      serum cortisol</a>.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n33">33,34</a></sup>
      Resolution of these changes is fairly rapid following the
      procedure.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n35">35</a></sup>
      Although it has been assumed that there are no <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/psych/rhinehart1/">long-term
      psychological sequelae</a> from this procedure, circumcised
      infants who were not anesthetized at the time of the
      procedure show <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2/">stronger
      pain responses to vaccinations</a> at 4 and 6 months of age
      than do uncircumcised infants or infants who received a
      topical anesthetic cream at the time of circumcision.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n36">36</a></sup>
      The use of sucrose-dipped pacifiers (24% solution) reduces
      crying time during circumcision and also modestly attenuates
      increases in heart rates (50% solution), but less so than the
      use of dorsal penile nerve block (see below).<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n37">37,38</a></sup></p>

      and <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/gunnar/">physiological
      indicators of pain caused by circumcision</a>. While
      recognizing that restraint itself is stressful, results of
      several double-blind, placebo-controlled studies confirm that
      DPNB prevents or decreases excursion from baseline values for
      heart rate, tissue oxygenation, and percentage of time spent
      crying during the circumcision procedure. Additionally, DPNB
      decreases behavioral scores indicative of agitation and pain
      and attenuates increases in plasma cortisol concentrations
      associated with circumcision.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n41">41-47</a></sup>
      Chlorprocaine is comparable to lidocaine and may possess a
      slightly faster onset of regional anesthesia.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n48">48</a></sup>
      The major complications of DPNB are bruising at the injection
      site (11%) that resolves within 1 to 2 weeks, and
      occasionally bleeding.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n49">49,50</a></sup>
      Systemic lidocaine toxicity has not been described. One case
      of penile necrosis after DPNB has been reported.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n51">51</a></sup>
      Evaluation of possible complications of DPNB has been limited
      to a 3-month follow-up.</p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Topical Local Anesthesia:</b> (Eutectic
      mixtures [EMLA]) EMLA is an acronym for eutectic mixture of
      local anesthetic. Each gram (1 mL) of cream contains
      lidocaine 2.5% (25 mg) and prilocaine 2.5% (25 mg). In one
      unblinded study, the application of 0.5 mL (1 g) under
      occlusion 55 to 70 minutes prior to restraint was associated
      with only modest attenuation of changes in heart rate, oxygen
      saturation, crying time, and facial grimacing compared to
      placebo cream.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n52">52</a></sup>
      Results of a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial were
      similar.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n53">53</a></sup>
      It is noteworthy that in adults, the duration of anesthesia
      after genital application of EMLA is considerably less than
      at other cutaneous sites.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n54">54</a></sup>
      In the absence of dose-response data, it is uncertain whether
      the maximal anesthetic effects on infants from EMLA had waned
      in these studies by the time the actual circumcision
      procedure was performed.</p>

      <p class="text1">Because EMLA contains prilocaine, the
      development of <a
      href="http://www.blackwell-science.com/products/journals/bjui/cases/bju688/bju688.htm">
      methemoglobinemia</a> (MetHb) is a possibility. However, when
      measured, blood concentrations of MetHb in neonates after
      application of 1 to 2 g of EMLA cream have been well below
      toxic values.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n53">53,55-57</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1">In a randomized, placebo-controlled study,
      application of 0.5 g of 30% lidocaine cream 20 minutes prior
      to circumcision was associated with less stress-related
      behaviors and smaller increases in plasma beta-endorphin
      concentrations than placebo. No other physiological variables
      were monitored and other studies on topical lidocaine have
      not been reported.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n58">58</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Subcutaneous Ring Block:</b> Ring block
      performed using 1 mL of 0.5% lidocaine without epinephrine
      delivered subcutaneously and circumferentially at the base of

      O<sub>2</sub> saturation.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n59">59</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text1"><b>Comparative Studies:</b> In 3 comparative
      studies DPNB was significantly more effective than EMLA cream
      in attenuating pain scores and physiological changes
      associated with circumcision.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n55">55,60,61</a></sup>
      However, in one <a
      href="http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/101/4/e5">study</a>
      the dose of EMLA was only 0.5 g and was applied 1 hour before
      the procedure.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n60">60</a></sup>
      In another, the dose was 2 g applied 90 minutes before the
      procedure.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n55">55</a></sup>
      In the third study, the dose of EMLA was not
      specified.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n61">61</a></sup>
      Ring block was more effective than either DPNB or EMLA in
      preventing increases in heart rate and reducing crying
      time.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n55">55</a></sup>
      Despite the clear evidence that newborn males generate brisk
      pain responses during circumcision, and the availability of
      methods to reduce pain during the procedure, a <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/howard1998/">recent
      survey</a> of residency training programs found that 26% of
      programs that taught circumcision provided no instruction on
      the use of local anesthesia. In programs that taught
      circumcision, pediatric (84%) and family practice residents
      (80%) were more likely than obstetric residents (60%) to
      learn about anesthetic techniques to prevent pain associated
      with circumcision.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n62">62</a></sup>
      Significant regional variation occurred within and across
      medical specialties.</p>

      <p><b>Summary and Comment</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Virtually all <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/">current policy
      statements</a> from specialty societies and medical
      organizations do not recommend routine neonatal circumcision,
      and support the provision of accurate and unbiased
      information to parents to inform their choice. The recent
      policy revision by the American Academy of Pediatrics also
      states that analgesia (anesthesia) should be provided for the
      procedure.</p>

      <p class="text1">Circumcision decreases the incidence of <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/goldman/">urinary
      tract infections in the first year of life</a>, and also
      protects against the development of <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/vanhowe/">penile
      cancer later in life</a>. The circumcised male also may be
      somewhat less susceptible to <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/vanhowe4/">HIV
      infection</a> and certain sexually transmissible diseases.
      The low incidence of urinary tract infections and penile
      cancer mitigates the potential medical benefits compared with
      the risks of circumcision. In the case of sexual transmission
      of HIV, behavioral factors are far more important in
      preventing these infections than the presence or absence of a
      foreskin.</p>

      <p class="text1">A majority of boys born in the United States
      still undergo nonritual circumcisions. This occurs in large
      measure because parental decision-making is based on social
      or cultural expectations, rather than medical
      concerns.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n63">63-67</a></sup>
      Studies from the 1980s suggested that the presentation of
      medical information on the potential advantages and
      disadvantages of circumcision had little influence on
      parents' decisions.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n64">64-66</a></sup>
      This finding was <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/procedure/tiemstra/">recently
      confirmed</a>.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n68">68</a></sup>
      In another contemporary study, nearly half of those
      physicians performing circumcisions did not discuss the
      potential medical risks and benefits of elective circumcision
      prior to delivery of the infant son. Deferral of discussion
      until after birth, combined with the fact that many parents'
      decisions about circumcision are preconceived, contribute to
      the high rate of elective circumcision.<sup><a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/#n67">67,68</a></sup>
      Major factors in parental decision-making are the father's
      circumcision status, opinions of family members and friends,
      a desire for conformity in their son's appearance, and the
      belief that the circumcised penis is easier to care for with
      respect to local hygiene.</p>

      <p class="text1">When the decision is made to proceed with
      circumcision, local anesthesia should be provided for the
      procedure. Ring block or dorsal penile blocks are most
      effective. EMLA cream has limited utility but has not been
      sufficiently investigated with regard to dose-response
      effects.</p>

      <p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b></p>

      <p class="text1">The following statements, recommended by the
      <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/2035.html"
      target="_blank">Council on Scientific Affairs</a>, were
      adopted as AMA policy at the 1999 AMA Interim Meeting.</p>

      <p class="text1">1. The AMA encourages training programs for
      pediatricians, obstetricians, and family physicians to
      incorporate information on the use of local pain control
      techniques for neonatal circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text1">2. The AMA supports the general principles
      of the <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/">1999
      Circumcision Policy Statement</a> of the American Academy of
      Pediatrics, which reads as follows: Existing scientific
      evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn
      male circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to
      recommend routine neonatal circumcision. In circumstances in
      which there are potential benefits and risks, yet the
      procedure is not essential to the child's current well-being,
      parents should determine what is in the best interest of the
      child. To make an informed choice, parents of all male
      infants should be given accurate and unbiased information and
      be provided the opportunity to discuss this decision. If a
      decision for circumcision is made, procedural analgesia
      should be provided.</p>

      <p class="text1">3. The AMA urges that as part of the <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/consent/"
      target="_blank">informed consent</a> discussion, the risks
      and benefits of pain control techniques for circumcision be
      thoroughly discussed to aid parents in making their
      decisions.</p>
