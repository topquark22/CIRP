CIRCUMCISION NO LONGER A "ROUTINE" SURGICAL PROCEDURE

Eleanor LeBourdais

Summary: "Nonmedical circumcision can no longer be considered
routine in a new era of children's rights and more careful
scrutiny of the medical necessity of surgical procedures.
Although the minor procedure has been practised for
centuries, custom, and cultural factors may have had greater
influence on the incidence of circumcision than the prevalence
of problems such as penile cancer and urinary tract infection that
it was thought to prevent."
