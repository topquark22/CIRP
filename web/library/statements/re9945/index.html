      <p>ABBREVIATION. SaO<sub>2</sub>, oxygen saturation.</p>

      <p class="text2">The <a href="http://www.iasp-pain.org/"
      target="_blank">International Association for the Study of
      Pain</a> has defined pain as "an unpleasant sensory and
      emotional experience associated with actual or potential
      tissue damage or described in terms of such damage."<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> The interpretation of pain is
      subjective. Each person forms an internal construct of pain
      through encountered injury. Several experts suggest that the
      neonate's expression of pain does not fit within the strict
      definition of the International Association for the Study of
      Pain because of the requirement for self-report.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2-4</a></sup> This lack of ability to report pain
      contributes to the failure of health care professionals to
      recognize and treat pain aggressively during infancy and
      early childhood.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> Because
      neonates cannot verbalize their pain, they depend on others
      to recognize, assess, and manage their pain. Therefore,
      health care professionals can diagnose neonatal pain only by
      recognizing the neonate's associated behavioral and
      physiological responses.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Stress is defined as "a physical, chemical,
      or emotional factor that causes bodily or mental tension and
      may be a factor in disease causation."<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> These responses can be specific to the
      stressor or can be generalized and nonspecific. Pain is
      always stressful, but stress is not necessarily painful; both
      require assessment, evaluation, and treatment. The signs of
      pain and stress must be distinguished from signs of
      life-threatening conditions, such as hypoxemia or carbon
      dioxide retention, that require other forms of
      intervention.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Studies indicate a lack of awareness among
      health care professionals of pain perception, assessment, and
      management in neonates.<sup><a href="#n9">9-11</a></sup> When
      analgesics were used in infants, they often were administered
      based only on the perceptions of health care professionals or
      family members. Fear of adverse reactions and toxic effects
      often contributed to the inadequate use of analgesics. In
      addition, health care professionals often focused on
      treatment of pain rather than a systematic approach to reduce
      or prevent pain.<sup><a href="#n12">12,13</a></sup> More
      recent surveys have demonstrated increased awareness among
      health care professionals of pain in neonates and infants and
      its assessment and management.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14-16</a></sup> Several textbooks on pain in
      neonates and infants have been published,<sup><a
      href="#n17">17-19</a></sup> and measures for assessing pain
      have been developed and validated.<sup><a
      href="#n20">20-24</a></sup> However, despite the advances in
      pain assessment and management, prevention and treatment of
      unnecessary pain attributable to anticipated noxious stimuli
      remain limited.<sup><a href="#n25">25-27</a></sup> Several
      important concepts must be recognized to provide adequate
      pain management for the preterm and term neonate:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Neuroanatomical components and neuroendocrine systems
        are sufficiently developed to allow transmission of painful
        stimuli in the neonate.<sup><a
        href="#n28">28-32</a></sup></li>

        <li>Exposure to prolonged or severe pain may increase
        neonatal morbidity.<sup><a href="#n33">33-36</a></sup></li>

        <li>Infants who have experienced pain during the neonatal
        period respond differently to subsequent painful
        events.<sup><a href="#n37">37-41</a></sup></li>

        <li>Severity of pain and effects of analgesia can be
        assessed in the neonate.<sup><a
        href="#n20">20-24,42-46</a></sup></li>

        <li>Neonates are not easily comforted when analgesia is
        needed.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></li>

        <li>A lack of behavioral responses (including crying and
        movement) does not necessarily indicate a lack of
        pain.<sup><a href="#n47">47</a></sup></li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>GENERAL PRINCIPLES</b></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">By late gestation, the
      fetus has developed the anatomic, neurophysiological, and
      hormonal components necessary to perceive pain.<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a>,<a href="#n28">28-32</a></sup> Preterm and term infants
      demonstrate similar or even exaggerated physiological and
      hormonal responses to pain compared with those observed in
      older children and adults.</span><sup><a
      href="#n11">11,33,35</a></sup> Some studies suggest that pain
      experienced early in life by term infants may exaggerate
      affective and behavioral responses during subsequent painful
      events.<sup><a href="#n37">37,38</a></sup> Neonates who were
      exposed to numerous painful and noxious stimuli between
      postconceptual weeks 28 and 32 showed different behavioral
      and physiological responses to pain compared with neonates of
      a similar postconceptual age who had not had such
      experiences.<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup> In addition,
      toddlers at 18 months corrected age who were of extremely low
      weight (&lt;1000 g) at birth (and thus exposed to numerous
      noxious stimuli in the neonatal intensive care unit) were
      rated by parents as being less sensitive (reactive) to
      painful stimuli (eg, bumps, cuts, common hurts) and
      demonstrating more somatic complaints compared with full-term
      infants.<sup><a href="#n41">41,48</a></sup> In another study,
      children's judgment about pain at age 8 to 10 years were
      examined using pictures of children in potentially painful
      situations (medical, recreational, daily living, and
      psychosocial situations were used as the pain
      stimuli).<sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup> Two groups of
      children who had experienced different exposure to
      nociceptive procedures in the neonatal period were compared.
      Unlike infants of birth weight &gt;2500 g, for extremely low
      birth weight infants (&lt;1000 g), medical pain intensity was
      rated significantly higher than psychosocial pain at 8 to 10
      years of age, at <i>P</i> &lt; .004.<sup><a
      href="#n39">39</a></sup> These clinical data support the
      experimental observations on the long-term effects of
      neonatal pain and stress.<sup><a href="#n49">49</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Several validated and reliable pain measures
      exist to assess acute pain in term and preterm
      neonates.<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> Behavioral
      indicators of pain (eg, facial expression, body movements,
      crying), and physiological indicators of pain (eg, changes in
      heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen
      saturation [SaO<sub>2</sub>], vagal tone, palmar sweating,
      and plasma cortisol or catecholamine levels) can be used to
      assess and manage stress and pain in neonates. Composite
      measures of neonatal pain include the following: 1) the
      Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) that includes facial
      actions, such as brow bulge, eyes squeezed shut, and
      nasolabial furrow, and physiological indicators, including
      heart rate and SaO<sub>2</sub> in the context of gestational
      age and neonatal state<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup>; 2)
      CRIES that assesses <b>C</b>rying, the <b>R</b>equirement for
      oxygen supplementation (for SaO<sub>2</sub> &gt;95%),
      <b>I</b>ncreases in heart rate and blood pressure, facial
      <b>E</b>xpression and <b>S</b>leeplessness<sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup>; and 3) the Neonatal Infant Pain
      Scale (NIPS), which assesses facial expression, cry,
      breathing patterns, movements of arms and legs, and state of
      arousal.<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> Other assessment
      measures are unidimensional but include multiple indicators
      of facial expression in term and preterm neonates. One such
      measure is the Neonatal Facial Coding System<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> that was developed for use in pain
      research, but study continues of its clinical
      usefulness.<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup> However, there is
      a paucity of measures to evaluate pain in very low birth
      weight neonates or those who require mechanical
      ventilation.<sup><a href="#n43">43,44</a></sup> There remains
      a need to establish the clinical usefulness of existing
      measures and to develop measures to assess potential pain in
      pharmacologically paralyzed neonates or neonates with chronic
      pain.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Pain is managed most
      effectively by preventing, limiting, or avoiding noxious
      stimuli and providing analgesia.</span><sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> Modifying the environment and
      providing anxiolytics for circumstances expected to be
      stressful also may be useful. The environment should be as
      conducive as possible to the well-being of the neonate and
      the family.<sup><a href="#n50">50,51</a></sup> Unnecessary
      noxious stimuli (acoustic, visual, tactile, vestibular) of
      neonates should be avoided. Simple comfort measures, such as
      swaddling, nonnutritive sucking (pacifier), and positioning
      (when not contraindicated because of specific medical or
      surgical conditions) should be used whenever possible for
      minor procedures.<sup><a href="#n52">52,53</a></sup> Oral
      administration of sucrose reduces pain associated with
      painful procedures.<sup><a href="#n54">54,55</a></sup>
      However, these interventions alone may not alleviate moderate
      to severe pain, and analgesic treatment should be provided as
      indicated.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Painful or stressful
      procedures should be minimized</span> and, when appropriate,
      coordinated with other aspects of the neonate's care.
      Furthermore, consideration of the least painful method is
      important. For example, when performed by trained personnel,
      obtaining blood by venipuncture may be less painful than heel
      lancing.<sup><a href="#n56">56-58</a></sup> Skillful
      placement of peripheral, central, or arterial lines reduces
      the need for repeated intravenous punctures or intramuscular
      injections. Thus, in some such cases, the risk-benefit
      balance may favor the more invasive indwelling catheters.
      Whenever possible, validated noninvasive monitoring
      techniques (eg, pulse oximetry) that are not tissue damaging
      should replace invasive methods.</p>

      <p class="text2">The risks and benefits of pain management
      techniques must be considered on an individual basis within
      the context of the type and severity of the painful stimulus.
      Pharmacological analgesia should be chosen carefully based on
      comprehensive assessment of the neonate, efficacy and safety
      of the drug, the clinical setting, and experience of the
      personnel using the drug. Drug doses, including those for
      local anesthetics, should be calculated carefully based on
      the current or most appropriate weight of the neonate, and
      initial doses should not exceed maximal recommended amounts.
      Subsequent doses should be modified based on multiple
      factors, including the cause of the pain, previous response,
      clinical condition, concomitant drug use, and the known
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the sedative and
      analgesic drugs administered. Medications that might result
      in the loss of protective reflexes or cause cardiorespiratory
      instability should be used only by appropriately trained
      persons in an environment equipped to handle emergencies.
      Monitoring to ensure adequate oxygenation, ventilation, and
      cardiovascular stability should follow the guidelines of the
      American Society of Anesthesiologists,<sup><a
      href="#n59">59</a></sup> the Canadian Anaesthetists
      Society,<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup> and the American
      Academy of Pediatrics.<sup><a href="#n61">61</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Studies are lacking on
      the management of pain in neonatal conditions associated with
      extensive tissue damage</span> and those resulting in
      recurrent or chronic pain (eg, necrotizing enterocolitis,
      meningitis, fractured bones). The effects of the use of
      analgesics or sedation during the neonatal period on
      long-term neurodevelopmental and psychological outcomes has
      not been well studied.<sup><a href="#n49">49</a></sup> No
      differences in intelligence, motor function, or behavior at 5
      to 6 years of age were found between neonates who received
      morphine for sedation during mechanical ventilation and
      placebo-treated neonates.<sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>PREVENTION OF ACUTE PAIN DURING OR AFTER SURGERY OR A
      PAINFUL PROCEDURE<br />
      General Anesthesia</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Advances in anesthetic medications,
      techniques, and monitoring by trained personnel have
      increased the safety and efficacy of general anesthesia for
      preterm and term neonates. The state of general anesthesia
      makes the patient pain-free and amnesic during surgery; the
      same medications and techniques can be used to extend the
      period of analgesia postoperatively.<sup><a
      href="#n63">63</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>Regional Anesthesia</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Regional techniques, such as peripheral
      nerve blocks and central neuraxis blockade (spinal,
      epidural), are sometimes used to provide anesthesia and
      analgesia for procedures on the trunk or limbs, as an adjunct
      to general anesthesia, and for postoperative
      analgesia.<sup><a href="#n64">64-68</a></sup> Examples of
      regional nerve blocks include ilioinguinal and
      iliohypogastric nerve blocks, penile block, digital block,
      local infiltration, and intercostal nerve blocks. The
      duration of such blocks can be extended by using
      vasoconstrictors (contraindicated in areas of end-arterial
      circulation, such as the penis, digit, and pinna of the ear).
      The duration of epidural blockade can be extended with the
      coadministration of opioids, clonidine, or both. Indwelling
      epidural catheters threaded from the caudal or lumbar region
      may provide analgesia for procedures above the
      diaphragm.<sup><a href="#n18">18,69,70</a></sup> These
      techniques should be used carefully by health care
      professionals trained in their use and with appropriate and
      careful observation. In neonates, intermittent administration
      of dilute local anesthetics with low-dose extradural opioids,
      such as fentanyl, offers less potential for the toxic effects
      of drugs than continuous infusion techniques with either drug
      alone. Careful calculation of doses is mandatory to avoid
      toxic effects for all uses of local anesthetic agents and for
      all other medications used to provide analgesia, sedation,
      and relief of anxiety. Accurate calculation is a particular
      concern in the care of preterm and term neonates in whom
      differences in protein binding and metabolism can result in
      local anesthetic drug accumulation and toxic effects.<sup><a
      href="#n71">71,72</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Continuous caudal or epidural blockade may
      be administered for several days postoperatively by using a
      continuous infusion pump. Continuous infusions are best
      managed by pain specialists trained in appropriate
      pharmacology, frequent assessment of effects, and the
      recognition of adverse reactions.</p>

      <p><b>Local Infiltration Anesthesia</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Analgesia for procedures in superficial
      areas (eg, chest tube insertion) usually can be managed with
      superficial infiltration with local anesthetic agents. Just
      as with regional nerve blocks, care must be taken to remain
      within maximal recommended total doses of local anesthetic
      agents. The addition of bicarbonate to local anesthetics can
      reduce the pain of local infiltration.<sup><a
      href="#n73">73</a></sup> For topical use, a cream containing
      lidocaine and prilocaine decreases the pain associated with a
      variety of minor procedures, although it was not effective
      for heel-lance procedures.<sup><a href="#n74">74-76</a></sup>
      For the success of topical analgesia, at least 1 hour must
      have elapsed between application and the time of the
      procedure; the analgesia may last 1 to 2 hours.<sup><a
      href="#n76">76</a></sup> Single applications of this cream
      have not been shown to cause clinically important
      methemoglobinemia in preterm and term neonates.<sup><a
      href="#n76">76</a></sup> However, despite no data
      demonstrating additive risk, caution should be used when
      other agents capable of causing methemoglobinemia (eg,
      acetaminophen) are coadministered.<sup><a
      href="#n77">77</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>Opioids</b></p>

      <p class="text2">A variety of opioids are available for
      pediatric use.<sup><a href="#n78">78,79</a></sup> Although
      most of these medications have not received formal approval
      for use in pediatric patients by the Food and Drug
      Administration, their use in children of all ages is
      indicated to treat the pain of procedures, as an adjunct to
      general anesthesia, for postoperative or postprocedural pain,
      and for the treatment of painful medical conditions. Such
      medications may be administered as single or intermittent
      boluses or as a continuous infusion. For prolonged use,
      continuous infusion is preferred to avoid large variations in
      plasma concentration. Whenever medications in this category
      are administered, there must be accompanying vigilance for
      potential adverse effects on the respiratory and
      cardiovascular systems. Such observations may be limited with
      a single administration but must be more intense with
      repeated doses, when administered by infusion, or when drug
      combinations are used. Agents known to compromise
      cardiorespiratory function should be administered only by
      persons experienced in airway management and in settings with
      the capacity for continuous monitoring of vital signs (ie,
      heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate,
      SaO<sub>2</sub>).<sup><a href="#n59">59-61</a></sup> The need
      for continued treatment with the opioid to manage pain
      increases the possibility of tolerance that requires dose
      escalation to maintain analgesia and slow withdrawal of the
      drug to avoid abstinence syndrome.</p>

      <p class="text2">The risk of adverse effects is directly
      related to rate of drug administration, total dose, and
      combination with other medications capable of central nervous
      system depression. Intravenous boluses of the synthetic
      opioids (eg, fentanyl, sufentanil, alfentanil) may be
      associated with glottic and chest wall rigidity.<sup><a
      href="#n80">80</a></sup> The propensity for these adverse
      effects is reduced by avoiding rapid bolus injection.
      Administration should be by frequent small aliquots or by
      infusion over several minutes. The health care professional
      who administers opioids should be trained in the recognition
      and treatment of the adverse complications, including the use
      of bag-mask ventilation, an opioid antagonist to oppose the
      respiratory depression, or a muscle relaxant to treat glottic
      and chest wall rigidity.<sup><a href="#n80">80</a></sup> The
      health care professional must have airway management skills
      and knowledge of the pharmacodynamics of the administered
      drugs to manage life-threatening events. When an opioid
      antagonist is administered, the analgesic effect of opioids
      also is antagonized. Opioid antagonists must be used with
      caution in neonates who have received prolonged treatment
      with opioids (&gt;4 days). In this situation, an antagonist
      (eg, naloxone) may precipitate acute opioid withdrawal with
      seizures, hypertension, and other adverse clinical
      consequences.<sup><a href="#n81">81</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Concomitant use of opioids and
      benzodiazepines necessitates a decrease in the total dose of
      opioid and benzodiazepine. However, nonopioid medications
      should not be used in place of opioids because they do not
      possess analgesic properties. Moreover, the risk of
      respiratory depression may be additive or synergistic.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are insufficient data to recommend one
      opioid over another. In general, meperidine is not
      recommended for prolonged administration owing to the
      possibility of the accumulation of toxic metabolites capable
      of causing seizures.<sup><a href="#n82">82</a></sup> When
      opioids or other sedating medications, such as
      benzodiazepines, are administered for a prolonged period,
      physical dependence and tolerance may develop, thus
      increasing the opioid or sedative requirements to maintain
      patient comfort.<sup><a href="#n81">81,83-85</a></sup> The
      long-term effects of opioids and sedatives have not been well
      established. However, the first concern of the health care
      professional should be the treatment of stress or pain, which
      later can be followed by managing the consequences of the
      stress or pain treatment.<sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">When stress or pain medications are no
      longer deemed necessary, slow weaning of the patient from
      opioids and other sedatives over a prolonged period may be
      required.<sup><a href="#n81">81</a></sup> Such weaning may be
      a gradual reduction in daily drug dosage with frequent
      reassessment to ensure that the patient is free of pain and
      withdrawal symptoms or it may be a change to longer-acting
      oral medications, such as methadone, that can be
      tapered.<sup><a href="#n81">81,83-85</a></sup> The starting
      dose of methadone should be calculated to provide a dose
      equivalent to the dose of opioid the neonate is receiving.
      Methadone kinetics and dosing requirements for extremely
      premature neonates have not been studied adequately.</p>

      <p class="text2">Titration of dose to observed clinical
      effect and administration of the lowest effective dose help
      to avoid toxic effects. Rectal administration of opioids has
      been described but is not generally recommended owing to
      irregular and unpredictable absorption.<sup><a
      href="#n77">77</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Generally, this category of medications is
      used to treat less intense pain and as an adjunct to reduce
      the total dose of more potent analgesics, such as opioids.
      Limited data are available on the pharmacokinetics of
      acetaminophen (paracetamol) in newborns.<sup><a
      href="#n86">86-88</a></sup> Acetaminophen does not reduce the
      response to pain due to heel-lance procedures<sup><a
      href="#n89">89</a></sup> but may provide some reduction in
      pain after circumcision.<sup><a href="#n90">90</a></sup>
      There are no studies in the newborn of the effectiveness and
      safety of ketorolac or ibuprofen to reduce pain.<sup><a
      href="#n91">91</a></sup></p>

      <p><b>MANAGEMENT OF NONPAINFUL STRESS (ANXIETY) IN THE
      NEONATE</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Behaviors associated with pain (eg, crying,
      grimacing, posturing, sweating, restlessness) also may
      accompany nonpainful care-giving procedures for low birth
      weight neonates.<sup><a href="#n45">45</a></sup> Additional
      research is needed to better differentiate pain, stress, and
      variation in behavioral or sleep and awake states.<sup><a
      href="#n92">92</a></sup> A method to quantitate stress in
      preterm neonates has been developed to assist neonatal health
      care professionals to recognize and reduce stress in preterm
      neonates, although its clinical usefulness requires further
      evaluation.<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Noxious environmental stimuli should be
      minimized. Only limited research addresses the short- and
      long-term efficacy and toxic effects of the pharmacological
      agents (sedatives and hypnotics) used to manage perceived
      neonatal anxiety. Thus, health care professionals must
      individualize decisions about the appropriateness of the use
      of these drugs based on extrapolation from adult experience
      and common sense. The following concepts must be kept in
      mind: 1) Sedatives and anxiolytics do not provide analgesia.
      If painful procedures are anticipated, analgesics should
      usually be administered. 2) Long-term use of many sedatives
      and hypnotics includes the risks of tolerance, dependency,
      and withdrawal. 3) Long-term outcome (particularly
      neurodevelopmental) for infants who have received long-term
      sedation is unknown, although the long-term effects of
      neonatal pain and stress were the focus of recent
      research.<sup><a href="#n37">37-41,48</a></sup> 4) Sedatives
      and hypnotics may cause respiratory and cardiovascular
      depression.<sup><a href="#n93">93-97</a></sup> Continuous
      pulse oximetry and frequent monitoring of vital signs is
      recommended strongly. 5) Use of combined therapy with a
      sedative or hypnotic and an opioid necessitates a decrease in
      dosage of each. Failure to reduce dosage when used in
      combination increases the risk of adverse effects, such as
      respiratory depression. In addition, certain combinations,
      such as fentanyl and midazolam, should not be given as rapid
      infusions because this combination is associated with severe
      systemic hypotension.<sup><a href="#n93">93-97</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Among older infants, benzodiazepines,
      barbiturates, chloral hydrate, and phenothiazines have been
      used for sedation and to relieve anxiety. Of these options,
      data are available for the use of benzodiazepines, chloral
      hydrate, and barbiturates in neonates. Of the
      benzodiazepines, midazolam has been approved for use in
      neonates, and a randomized, controlled trial has demonstrated
      sedative effects.<sup><a href="#n97">97</a></sup> However,
      adverse hemodynamic effects and abnormal movements have been
      associated with its use in neonates.<sup><a
      href="#n94">94-98</a></sup> If used, a continuous infusion or
      administration of individual doses over at least 10 minutes
      is recommended to reduce the risk of adverse effects. Data
      are insufficient to assess the efficacy and safety of
      lorazepam.<sup><a href="#n99">99-103</a></sup> Diazepam is
      not recommended owing to its long half-life, its long-acting
      metabolites, and concern about the benzyl alcohol content,
      although the dose of benzyl alcohol is far less than that
      associated with toxic effects.<sup><a
      href="#n104">104,105</a></sup> Chloral hydrate has been used
      extensively as a sedative-hypnotic in neonates<sup><a
      href="#n106">106</a></sup> but it is metabolized to
      trichloroethanol, which competes for glucuronidation and may
      exacerbate hyperbilirubinemia.<sup><a
      href="#n107">107</a></sup> In addition, another metabolite
      (trichloroacetic acid) persists for up to 1 week after a
      single dose.<sup><a href="#n108">108</a></sup> Owing to a
      long half-life for trichloroacetic acid and trichloroethanol
      in premature neonates, repeated doses may be associated with
      adverse effects (eg, central nervous system depression,
      arrhythmias, and renal failure).<sup><a
      href="#n109">109</a></sup> Thus, repeated doses should not be
      given. Phenobarbital has a long half-life, and barbiturates
      may increase the reaction to painful stimuli.<sup><a
      href="#n110">110</a></sup> Evidence of the effectiveness and
      safety of phenothiazines is lacking; these drugs are not
      recommended.</p>

      <p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>To evaluate and reduce the stress and pain experienced
        by neonates, validated measures and assessment tools must
        be used consistently. The assessments should continue as
        long as the neonate requires treatment for stress or
        pain.</li>

        <li>Health care professionals should use appropriate
        environmental, nonpharmacological (behavioral), and
        pharmacological interventions to prevent, reduce, or
        eliminate the stress and pain of neonates.</li>

        <li>Pharmacological agents with known pharmacokinetic and
        pharmacodynamic properties and demonstrated efficacy in
        neonates should be used. Agents known to compromise
        cardiorespiratory function should be administered only by
        persons experienced in neonatal airway management and in
        settings with the capacity for continuous monitoring.</li>

        <li>Health care institutions should develop and implement
        patient care policies to assess, prevent, and manage pain
        in neonates, including those receiving palliative
        care.</li>

        <li>Educational programs to increase the skills of health
        care professionals in the assessment and management of
        stress and pain in neonates should be provided.</li>

        <li>There is a need for development and validation of
        neonatal pain assessment tools that are easily applicable
        in the clinical setting.</li>

        <li>For research purposes, a minimal set of well-defined
        outcome measures, including short- and long-term effects of
        interventions aimed at reducing stress and pain in the
        neonate, should be identified to permit statistical
        synthesis of data (meta-analysis) and more accurate
        estimates of effect size.</li>
