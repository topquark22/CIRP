       Medical Organization Official Policy Statements</h1>

      <p class="intro">This directory contains official policy
      statements of various medical organizations regarding
      non-therapeutic male circumcision, along with discussions of
      these positions. All known statements by national medical
      organizations are accessible from this page. No statement
      recommends the practice of non-therapeutic child
      circumcision.</p>

      <h2><font face="arial" color="navy">Introduction</font></h2>

      <p class="intro">Medical organizations in the various English
      speaking nations have found it appropriate to issue policy
      statements for the information of the medical community and
      the public. The Circumcision Reference Library has collected
      these official policy statements, both old and new, from the
      various English speaking nations. The medical societies of
      non-English speaking nations do not issue circumcision policy
      statements because neonatal male circumcision is not a
      practice of those countries. The older statements may not
      reflect current policy but are presented for reference
      purposes.</p>

      <p class="intro"><b>Conflict of interest.</b> Medical
      organizations are political associations of doctors that have
      a duty to represent the interests of their doctor members, of
      whom some may profit by performing circumcision. The
      protection of the income and estates of the members may be
      given high priority. This duty to the members may in some
      instances prevent complete candor about the effects of
      non-therapeutic circumcision. Generally, the alleged
      prophylactic benefits of male circumcision are overstated
      while the risks, complications, certain injury, and other
      drawbacks are understated. Human rights, legal, and ethical
      issues usually glossed over. The content of circumcision
      policy statements may also be influenced by religious and
      political considerations.</p>

      <p>The Royal Australasian College of Physicians published a
      new position statement, prepared under the supervision of
      Professor David A. Forbes of the University of Western
      Australia, regarding the non-therapeutic circumcision of male
      infants in September 2010. The statement says:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "<b>After reviewing the currently available evidence, the
        RACP believes that the frequency of diseases modifiable by
        circumcision, the level of protection offered by
        circumcision and the complication rates of circumcision do
        not warrant routine infant circumcision in Australia and
        New Zealand.</b>"

      <p>In September 2002, under the lead of the <strong>Royal
      Australasian College of Physicians (RACP), Paediatrics and
      Child Health Division</strong>, six major medical societies
      of Australasia developed a unified position statement on male
      circumcision. All six medical societies (the <b>RACP</b>,
      <b>Australian Association of Paediatric Surgeons</b>, <b>New
      Zealand Society of Paediatric Surgeons</b>, <b>Urological
      Society of Australasia</b>, <b>Royal Australasian College of
      Surgeons</b>, and <b>Paediatric Society of New Zealand</b>)
      have now corroborated the <strong><a href="#canada">Canadian
      Paediatric Society</a></strong>, declaring that circumcision
      of newborn males should not be routinely performed. The new
      statement firmly declares: "There are no medical indications
      for routine male circumcision." This statement was slightly
      revised in September 2004. This statement was retired in
      2010.</p>

      <p>In 1998, the former <strong>Australian College of
      Paediatrics (ACP)</strong> was absorbed into the
      <strong>Royal Australasian College of Physicians
      (RACP)</strong> as the <strong>Division of Paediatrics and
      Child Health</strong>. In 1971, 1983, and 1996, The ACP and
      its predecessor organisations had issued prior statements
      regarding male circumcision. The 1971 statement affirmed that
      there is no medical indication for neonatal circumcision. In
      1983, the <b>ACP</b> declared an official policy discouraging
      circumcision. In 1996, the organization went further,
      expressing concern that neonatal circumcision may violate
      human rights. In this statement the <b>ACP</b> disclosed the
      traumatic nature of circumcision, recommending that parents
      should be given more complete facts about the procedure.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Australasian Association of Paediatric
      Surgeons (AAPS)</strong> issued its first statement on
      circumcision in 1996. The <b>AAPS</b> does not support or
      condone the practice of child circumcision.</p>

      <p>The Federal Council of the <strong>Australian Medical

      <p>The <b>Australian P&aelig;diatric Association</b> passed a
      resolution on April 24, 1971 that neonatal circumcision
      should not be performed as a routine measure (in the absence
      of a medical indication). That resolution was reported in a
      letter published in the <i>Medical Journal of Australia</i>
      on May 22, 1971.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Canadian Paediatric Society</strong> issued
      its first statement on neonatal circumcision in 1975. It
      issued a supplement in 1982 and again in 1989 in response to
      the Wiswell claims regarding UTI that appeared in the medical
      literature. These statements are collected into one file. The
      CPS issued a completely new policy statement in 1996 which is
      in its own file.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a id="cps1975" href="/library/statements/cps1975/"

        1989)</a><br />
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>This statement rejects the claim of Drs. Warner and
      Strashin that neonatal circumcision is a cost-effective
      procedure.</p>

      <ul>

        1982;126:1399.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The following statement by the Canadian Paediatric Society
      was issued especially to reject the contentions of Thomas E.
      Wiswell, MD, concerning the value of neonatal circumcision in
      preventing urinary tract infection.</p>

        <li><a id="cps3" href="/library/statements/cps3/"
        name="cps3">Canadian Paediatric Society (1989)</a></li>

      <p>This is the current CPS policy statement:</p>

        <li><a id="cps1996" name="cps1996"></a> Fetus and Newborn
        Committee, Canadian Paediatric Society. <a

        <i>Canadian Medical Association Journal</i>
        1996;154(6):769-80. (link to CPS website)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The CPS recommends that "Circumcision of newborns should
      not be routinely (i.e.,in the absence of medical indication)
      performed." Since there are no medical indications for
      circumcision in the newborn period, in effect, the CPS is
      saying that newborn circumcisions should not be
      performed.</p>
      <br />

      <p>The <strong>College of Physicians and Surgeons of British
      Columbia (CPSBC)</strong> issued policy statements/guidance
      on circumcision in 2002, 2004 and 2009.</p>

          href="./cpsbc2009/cpsbc-circ-stmt2009.pdf"
          target="_blank">British Columbia</a>
          states that:<br />
           

          <blockquote>
            <p>"The matter of infant male circumcision is
            particularly difficult in regards to human rights, as
            it involves consideration of the rights of the infant
            as well as the rights of the parents. Under the
            Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the United
            Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, an
            infant has rights that include security of person,
            life, freedom and bodily integrity. Routine infant male
            circumcision is an unnecessary and irreversible
            procedure. Therefore, many consider it to be
            'unwarranted mutilating surgery.'</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>"Many adult men are increasingly concerned about
            whether their parents had the right to give consent for
            infant male circumcision. They claim that an infant's
            rights should take priority over any parental rights to
            make such a decision. This procedure should be delayed
            to a later date when the child can make his own
            informed decision. Parental preference alone does not
            justify a non-therapeutic procedure."</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The CPSBC's previous official circumcision policy
          statement was issued in June 2004. This position strongly
          cautioned physicians against the performance of
          unnecessary elective non-therapeutic circumcision of a
          child. If an unnecessary elective non-therapeutic
          circumcision is to be performed, this statement requires
          physicians to obtain the consent of both parents before
          performing an unnecessary elective non-therapeutic
          circumcision of a child.</p>

      <p>The British Medical Journal (BMJ) is published by the
      <strong>British Medical Association (BMA)</strong>.
      Editorials in the BMJ are considered to represent the policy
      of the <i>BMA</i>. The BMJ has published two editorials on
      male child circumcision.</p>

      <p>The first editorial (1979) took a position against

      <p>The <strong>British Medical Association</strong> felt
      compelled to issue a "guidance" for doctors in 1996 due to
      widespread questions about the ethics and lawfulness of
      neonatal circumcision. This statement does not address
      medical issues but does discuss ethical and legal issues. The
      statement recognizes the right of physicians to be
      conscientious objectors to the practice of male circumcision.
      It recommends that doctors obtain the consent of
      <cite>both</cite> parents before carrying out a circumcision
      operation. This now outmoded statement is retained for

      <p>The 1996 guidance on circumcision is outmoded by legal
      developments in the United Kingdam and has been replaced by a
      new statement in April 2003. This statement was revised in
      2006 to reflect further legal challenges to the lawfulness of
      non-therapeutic circumcision in the United Kingdom.</p>

      <p>The <strong>General Medical Council</strong> (GMC) of the
      United Kingdom is the semi-official body that regulates
      medical care within the United Kingdom. Rising concern about
      the ethics and lawfulness of child circumision has caused the
      GMC to issue an interim statement for the guidance of doctors
      in the United Kingdom. The <i>GMC</i> has also asked to
      <strong>Royal College of Paediatrics and Child
      Health</strong> and the <strong>British Association of
      Paediatric Surgeons</strong> to produce a guidance on the
      medical aspects of male circumcision, (1997) A statement
      eventually was produced in 2001. (See below).</p>

      <p>The <strong>BAPS</strong> issued a second statement in

      limited to the medical aspects of non-therapeutic

      of male non-therapeutic circumcision were outside the scope

      <p>The <strong>American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)</strong>
      issued a brief statement within its 1971 hospital care
      manual. An <i>ad hoc</i> committee issued a longer statement
      in 1975. More information was contained in the 1978 hospital
      care manual. A supplement to the 1975 statement was issued in
      1989 by a task force assembled for that purpose. This 1989
      supplement recognized the pain of neonatal circumcision for
      the first time. The 1989 statement reaffirmed the previous
      position that there is no medical indication for neonatal
      circumcision and reported new information on the role of the
      HPV virus in cervical cancer. The 1997 statement emphasized
      the elective nature of child circumcision. The Circumcision
      Reference Library has combined these statements into one
      file. The AAP statements dated prior to 1999 have been
      superseded by the 1999 policy statement. The 1999 policy
      statement has its own file.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a id="aap" href="/library/statements/aap/"
        name="aap">American Academy of Pediatrics (1971, 1975,
        1977, 1989, 1997)</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The penultimate policy statement of the <i>AAP</i> is the
      1999 Circumcision Policy Statement. The AAP does <i>not</i>
      recommend routine (performed in the absence of medical
      indication) circumcision of the newborn. The statement
      emphasizes the need for well-informed consent of the
      <cite>parents</cite> (plural).</p>

        1999;103(3):686-93.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <b>AAP</b> also issued a statement on female genital
      mutilation in 1998. AAP policy for male genital altering
      surgery is inconsistent with the policy for female genital
      altering surgery.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.aap.org/policy/re9749.html"
        target="_blank">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> Position
        Statement on Female Genital Mutilation (1998)<br />
        (link to AAP website)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <b>AAP</b> has also issued several other statements
      relevant to the consideration of male circumcision. The first
      is its statement on neonatal anesthesia which was issued in
      1987. This statement anticipates the new AAP position that
      pain control is required for circumcision pain.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="/library/pain/aap/">Neonatal Anesthesia
        (1987)</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <b>AAP</b> statement on breastfeeding which was issued
      in 1997 is relevant because it recommends breastfeeding as a
      preventive measure against urinary tract infection.
      Previously, the <i>AAP</i> recommended circumcision as a
      preventive measure against urinary tract infection. This is
      an important policy change.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.aap.org/policy/re9729.html"
        target="_blank">Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk
        (1997)</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Furthermore, the <b>AAP</b> statement on breastfeeding
      contains an implicit advice against circumcision: It states
      that "<i>procedures that may interfere with breastfeeding or
      traumatize the infant should be avoided or minimized.</i>"
      Neonatal circumcision is the most common traumatic procedure
      carried out on newborns.</p>

      <p>The 1999 <b>AAP</b> Circumcision Policy Statement's
      position on the medical ethics of circumcision is
      inconsistent with major AAP Committee on Bioethics policy
      statements. The AAP completely revised its policy on informed
      consent in 1995 to bring their policy into conformity with
      the provisions of the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/"><i>UN Convention on the
      Rights of the Child</i> (1989)</a>. The 1995 statement of the
      Committee on Bioethics says that parents may only grant
      permission for diagnosis and treatment. This would exclude
      consent for non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision which is
      neither diagnosis nor treatment. The statement also calls for
      the delay on non-essential procedures until the child is
      developmentally capable of granting consent.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="/library/ethics/AAP/">Informed Consent,
        Parental Permission, and Assent in Pediatric Practice
        (1995)</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The 1999 <b>AAP</b> Circumcision Policy Statement's
      section on medical ethics is also inconsistent with the AAP
      Committee on Bioethics statement on Religious Objections to
      Medical Care:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="/library/ethics/AAP3/">Religious Objections to
        Medical Care (1997)</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>This statement affirms that children have a right to grow
      up free from preventable disease or injury (circumcision is a
      preventable injury). The statement recognizes important
      limitations on the parent's right to force their religious
      practices onto a child, if those practices might harm the
      child's health. Consistent with this view, the <a
      href="/library/ethics/AAP/">AAP Committee on Bioethics</a>
      states that religion is not a defense when a child is harmed.
      These statements are also in conformity with the provisions
      of the <a href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/"><i>United
      Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</i> (1989)</a>,
      which states that children have a right to grow up free of
      traditional practices that are prejudicial to health.</p>

      <p>The <strong>American Academy of Family Physicians
      (AAFP)</strong> has withdrawn its previous cautious,
      legalistic statement that emphasizes the lack of therapeutic
      benefit, controversial nature of male neonatal circumcision,
      and the need for well-informed consent of the parents
      (plural). The current (2002) statement also emphasizes lack
      of therapeutic benefit and likens neonatal circumcision to a
      "cosmetic" procedure and expresses ethical concerns about
      non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision:</p>

      <p>The <strong>American Medical Association (AMA)</strong>
      has issued its first ever statement on neonatal
      non-therapeutic circumcision. The statement calls for the

      non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision.</p>
