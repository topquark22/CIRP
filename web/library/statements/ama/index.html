       <p>The medical profession has long subscribed to a body
of ethical statements developed primarily for the benefit of
the patient.  As a member of this profession, a physician
must recognize responsibility not only to patients, but also
to society, to other health professionals, and to self.  The

Association are not laws, but standards of conduct which
define the essentials of honorable behavior for the physician.</p>

       medical service with compassion and respect for human
       dignity.</li>

   <li>A physician shall deal honestly with patients and
       colleagues, and strive to expose those physicians
       deficient in character or competence, or who engage
       in fraud or deception.</li>

   <li>A physician shall respect the law and also recognize
       a responsibility to seek changes in those require-
       ments which are contrary to the best interest of the
       patient.</li>

   <li>A physician shall respect the rights of patients, of

       of other health professionals when indicated.</li>

   <li>A physician shall, in the provision of appropriate
       patient care, except in emergencies, be free to
       choose whom to serve, with whom to associate, and the

   <li>A physician shall recognize a responsibility to
