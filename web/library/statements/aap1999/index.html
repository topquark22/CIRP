      circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to
      recommend routine neonatal circumcision. In circumstances in
      which there are potential benefits and risks, yet <span

      current well-being</span>, parents should determine what is
      in the best interest of the child. To make an informed
      choice, parents of all male infants should be given accurate
      and unbiased information and be provided the opportunity to
      discuss this decision. If a decision for circumcision is
      made, procedural analgesia should be provided.</b></p>

      class="init"><b>A</b></span>lthough<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></font> the exact frequency is unknown,
      it is estimated that 1.2 million newborn males are
      circumcised in the United States annually at a <a
      href="/library/procedure/garry/">cost</a> of between $150 and
      $270 million. This practice has been advocated for reasons
      that vary from symbolic ritual to preventive health measure.
      Until the last half century, there has been limited
      scientific evidence to support or repudiate the routine
      practice of male circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Over the past several decades, the American
      Academy of Pediatrics has published several policy statements
      on neonatal circumcision of the male infant.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n1">1-3</a></sup></font> Beginning in
      its 1971 manual, <a
      href="/library/statements/aap#1971"><i>Standards and
      Recommendations of Hospital Care of Newborn Infants</i></a>,
      and reiterated in the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap#1975">1975</a> and 1983
      revisions, the Academy concluded that there was no absolute
      medical indication for routine circumcision.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The Academy designated
        non-therapeutic circumcision of the newborn as an
        <i>elective</i>, no longer <i>routine</i>, procedure in
        1997.]</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">In <a
      href="/library/statements/aap#1989">1989</a>, because of new
      research on circumcision status and urinary tract infection
      (UTI) and sexually transmitted disease (STD)/acquired
      immunodeficiency syndrome, the Academy concluded that newborn
      male circumcision has potential health benefits and
      advantages as well as disadvantages and risks.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></font> This statement
      also recommended that when circumcision is considered the
      benefits and risks should be explained to the parents and
      informed consent obtained. Subsequently, a number of medical
      societies in the developed world have published statements
      that do not support routine circumcision of male
      newborns.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n5">5-7</a></sup></font> In its <a
      href="/library/statements/acp1996/">position statement</a>,
      the Australian College of Paediatrics emphasized that in all
      cases, the medical attendant should avoid exaggeration of
      either the risks or benefits of this procedure.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="cirp">[CIRP note: A <i>potential benefit</i> is
        one that has been suggested, but has not been realized. On
        the other hand, the risks, complications, disadvantages and
        certain injury of circumcision are real and proven.]</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Because of the ongoing debate, as well as
      the publication of new research, it was appropriate to
      reevaluate the issue of routine neonatal circumcision. This
      Task Force adopted an <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.ebmny.org/">evidence-based</a> approach to
      analyzing the medical literature concerning circumcision. The
      studies reviewed were obtained through a search of the
      English language medical literature from 1960 to the present
      and, additionally, through a search of the bibliographies of
      the published studies.</p>

      <p align="center"><a id="incidence"
      name="incidence"></a><b><a
      href="/library/statistics/">EPIDEMIOLOGY</a></b></p>

      <p class="text2">The percentage of male infants circumcised
      in infancy varies by geographic location, by religious
      affiliation, and to some extent, by socioeconomic
      classification. Circumcision is uncommon in Asia, South
      America, Central America, and most of Europe. In <a
      href="/library/statistics/Canada/">Canada</a>, ~48% of males
      are circumcised.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup></font> Some groups such as followers
      of the Jewish and Islamic faiths practice circumcision for
      religious and cultural reasons.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n9">9,10</a></sup></font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: According to the Canadian
        Institute for Health Information, the incidence of male
        neonatal circumcision in Canada in 2005 was 9.2
        percent.]</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">There are few data to help estimate
      accurately the number of newborn males circumcised annually
      in the United States. According to the <a
      href="/library/statistics/USA/">National Center for Health
      Statistics</a> (NCHS); 64.1% of male infants were circumcised
      in the United States during 1995 (unpublished data, 1997).
      However, data from the NCHS are based on voluntary collection
      of data from participating hospitals; &lt;5% of hospitals in
      the United States participate. Thus, NCHS data provide an
      inadequate sample to estimate national circumcision
      frequency.</p>

      <p class="text2">More specific data on circumcision rates are
      &gt;1 decade old. Data obtained from hospital records in
      metropolitan Atlanta, GA, document circumcision rates of 84%
      to 89% in the period 1985 to 1986.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup></font> This study demonstrated that
      hospital discharge data, which rely on medical record face
      sheet information, underestimate the true incidence of
      neonatal circumcision. Using such hospital discharge data, it
      was estimated that 45.5% of male infants born in New York
      City and 69.6% of male infants born elsewhere in New York
      State were circumcised at birth in the year 1985.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup></font> In addition,
      none of these sources included rates for ritual circumcision
      or subsequent outpatient procedures, thus, these rates of
      circumcision are even more likely to be underestimated.</p>

      <p class="text2">Differences in circumcision rates related to
      demographic variables are not well described. One <a
      href="/library/general/laumann/">study</a>, which surveyed
      adult men, suggested that in the United States, the frequency
      of circumcision varies directly with maternal education, a
      marker for socioeconomic status.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup></font> Circumcision rates also vary
      among racial and ethnic groups, with whites considerably more
      likely to be circumcised than blacks or Hispanics (81% vs 64%
      or 54%).<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup></font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: According to the National
        Hospital Discharge Survey, the overall incidence of male
        neonatal circumcision in the United States in 2003 was 55.9
        percent.]</p>

      href="/library/normal/">EMBRYOLOGIC AND ANATOMIC<br />
       CONSIDERATIONS</a></b></p>

      <p class="text2">Embryologically, the penis glans derives
      from the genital tubercle, which has developed by 4 to 6
      weeks' gestation. The primitive urethral folds present in the
      male human embyro fuse to form the penile urethra. The
      genital swellings, present early in development, subsequently
      become the scrotum in males. The skin of the body of the
      penis begins growing forward at about 8 weeks' gestation and
      covers the glans eventually. Initially, <a
      href="/library/anatomy/deibert/">squamous epithelium has no
      separation between the glans and the foreskin</a>. Separation
      of epithelial layers that may be only partially complete at
      birth progress with development of desquamated tissue in
      pockets until the complete separation of tissue layers forms
      the <i>preputial space</i>. As a result of the incomplete
      separation, the prepuce or foreskin may not be fully
      retractable until several years after birth. In <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">~90% of uncircumcised
      males, the foreskin is retractable by age 5 years</a>. <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">Partial adhesions with smegma
      accumulation may persist in small numbers of uncircumcised
      males through childhood and even into adolescence</a>.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n14">14-16</a></sup></font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: A survey carried out in
        Denmark, where male circumcision is rare, found that the
        mean age of first foreskin retraction is 10.4
        years-of-age.]</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Epidermal keratinization occurs on the skin
      of the penile shaft but not on the mucosal surface of the
      foreskin.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup></font> One <a
      href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">study</a> suggests that there
      may be a concentration of specialized sensory cells in
      specific ridged areas of the foreskin but not in the skin of
      the penile shaft. There are conflicting data regarding the <a
      href="/library/disease/STD/fleiss3/">immune capabilities of
      preputial tissue</a>. Studies differ on the number,
      distribution, and location of Langerhans' cells in the
      foreskin.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n18">18,19</a></sup></font> No controlled scientific
      data are available regarding the differing immune function in
      a penis with or without a foreskin.</p>

      <p align="center"><a id="problems" name="problems"></a><b><a
      href="/library/complications/vanhowe/">PENILE
      PROBLEMS</a></b></p>

      <p class="text2">Penile problems may develop in both
      circumcised and uncircumcised males. The true frequency of
      these problems is unknown. In one 8-year <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">study</a> of a cohort of 1948
      uncircumcised Danish schoolboys between 6 and 17 years of
      age, 4% of the boys had phimosis (which prevented the
      foreskin from being retracted by gentle manipulation) and 2%
      had "tight prepuce" so that the foreskin could be retracted
      but with slight difficulty.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">The only longitudinal <a
      href="/library/complications/fergusson/">study</a> to address
      this issue in both circumcised and uncircumcised boys
      followed a birth cohort of 500 New Zealand boys until the age
      of 8 years; it was noted that the relationship between risks
      of penile problems and circumcision status varied with the
      child's age.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup></font> The majority of these
      problems were described as penile inflammation and were noted
      to be relatively minor. In this study, <span
      class="yellow">circumcised infant boys had a significantly
      higher risk of penile problems (such as meatitis) than did
      uncircumcised boys</span>, whereas, after infancy, the rate
      of penile problems (such as balanitis and inflammation of the
      foreskin) were significantly higher in older uncircumcised
      boys.</p>

      <p class="text2">A retrospective study conducted at two inner
      city clinics asked parents of boys 4 months to 12 years of
      age to recall whether their sons had ever developed any
      penile problems. Hispanic parents constituted 73% of those
      responding. Although parents of uncircumcised boys reported
      an increased number of medical visits for penile problems,
      the frequency of balanitis and irritation was not
      significantly different between circumcised and uncircumcised
      boys.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup></font>
      In addition, most problems reported were minor. Case reports
      suggest an increased frequency of paraphimosis in the
      uncircumcised elderly men who require intermittent or chronic
      bladder catheterization.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n22">22-24</a></sup></font> Other case reports
      indicate that balanitis occurs more frequently in
      uncircumcised men than in circumcised men and suggest an
      increased frequency of balanitis in men with diabetes and in
      uncircumcised soldiers during wartime.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">Chronic inflammation of the foreskin may

      href="/library/procedure/">METHODS OF
      CIRCUMCISION</a></b></p>

      <p class="text2">There are three methods of circumcision that
      are commonly used in the newborn male. These are all include
      the use of devices: the <a
      href="/library/procedure/gomco/">Gomco</a> clamp, the <a
      href="/library/procedure/plastibell/">Plastibell</a> device,
      and the <a target="_blank"
      href="http://blues.fd1.uc.edu/~reynolrd/html/rdr5.html">Mogen</a>
      clamp (or variations derived from the same principle on which
      each of these devices is based).</p>

      <p class="text2">The elements that are common to the use of
      each of these devices to accomplish circumcision include the
      following: estimation of the amount of external skin to be
      removed; dilation of the preputial orifice so that the glans
      can be visualized to ensure that the glans itself is normal;
      bluntly freeing the inner preputial epithelium from the
      epithelium of the glans; placing the device (at times a
      dorsal slit is necessary to do so); leaving the device in
      situ long enough to produce hemostasis and amputation of the
      foreskin.</p>

      <p class="text2">It is important that those who practice
      circumcision become sufficiently skilled at the technical
      aspects of the procedure so that <a

      can be minimized. Those performing circumcision should be
      adept at suturing to ensure that hemostasis can be secured
      when necessary and that skin edges can be brought together if
      they should separate widely. If circumcision is done in the

      <p class="text2">Should circumcision become necessary after

      pain and physiologic stress</a>. Neonatal physiologic

      href="#n40">40</a></sup></font> Several methods to provide
      analgesia for circumcision have been evaluated.</p>
      <a id="EMLA" name="EMLA"></a> 

      <h4>Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics (EMLA Cream)</h4>

      <p class="text2"><a
      href="/library/complications/EMLA/">EMLA</a> cream,
      containing 2.5% lidocaine and 2.5% prilocaine, attenuates the
      pain response to circumcision when applied 60 to 90 minutes
      before the procedure. Compared with placebo groups, neonates
      who had EMLA cream applied spend less time crying and have
      smaller increases in heart rate during circumcisions.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n41">41-43</a></sup></font> The
      analgesic effect is limited during the phases associated with
      extensive tissue trauma such as during lysis of adhesions and
      tightening of the clamp.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n42">42,43</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">Ideally, 1 to 2 g of EMLA cream is applied
      to the distal half of the penis, which is then wrapped in an
      occlusive dressing. There is a theoretic concern about the
      potential for neonates to develop methemoglobinemia after the
      application of EMLA cream, because a metabolite of prilocaine
      can oxidize hemoglobin to methemoglobin. When measured, blood
      levels of methemoglobin in neonates after the application of
      1 g of EMLA cream have been well below toxic levels.<font

      <a id="DPNB" name="DPNB"></a> 

      <h4>Dorsal Penile Nerve Block (DPNB)</h4>

      <p class="text2"><a href="/library/pain/williamson/">DPNB</a>
      is very effective in reducing the behavioral and physiologic
      indicators of pain caused by circumcision. Compared with
      control subjects who received no analgesia, neonates with
      DPNB cry 45% to 76% less,<font size="2"><sup><a

      in oxygen saturation during the procedure.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n39">39,52</a></sup></font>

      to 5 mm on each side until Buck's fascia is encountered.
      After aspiration, the local anesthetic is injected. Systemic
      lidocaine levels obtained with use of this technique
      demonstrated peak concentrations at 60 minutes, well below
      toxic ranges.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n52">52</a></sup></font> Several studies evaluating

      <h4>Subcutaneous Ring Block</h4>

      <p class="text2">A subcutaneous circumferential ring of 0.8
      mL of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine at the midshaft of the
      penis was found to be more effective than EMLA cream or DPNB

      size="2"><sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup></font> Although all
      treatment groups experienced an attenuated pain response, the

      rates more consistently than did EMLA cream or DPNB
      throughout all stages of circumcision. In another <a
      href="/library/pain/masciello/">study</a>, after a
      subcutaneous injection of lidocaine had been given at the
      level of the corona, it was noted that fewer infants cried
      during the dissection of the foreskin, placement of the bell,
      and clamping of the Gomco, compared with those infants with a
      DPNB,<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n58">58</a></sup></font>
      Additionally, the cortisol response was diminished in the

      size="2"><sup><a href="#n58">58</a></sup></font> No
      complications of this simple and highly effective technique
      have been reported.</p>

      <h4>Others</h4>

      <p align="justify">Sucrose on a pacifier has been
      demonstrated to be more effective than water for decreasing
      cries during circumcision.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n59">59</a></sup></font> Acetominophen may provide <a

      href="#n60">60</a></sup></font> Neither technique is
      sufficient for the operative pain and cannot be recommended
      as the sole method of analgesia. A more physiologic
      positioning of the infant in a padded environment may
      decrease distress during the procedure.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n61">61</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">In summary, analgesia is safe and effective
      in reducing the procedural pain associated with circumcision,

      href="http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/101/6/e5">adequate
      analgesia should be provided</a> if neonatal circumcision is

      IN<br />
       INFANT MALES</a></b></p>

      <p class="text2">There have been <a
      href="/library/disease/UTI/chessare/">several studies</a>
      published in the medical literature over the past 15 years
      that address the association between circumcision status and
      UTI.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n62">62-68</a></sup></font>
      Because the majority of UTI in males occur during the first
      year of life, almost all the studies that examine the
      relationship between UTI and circumcision focus on this
      period. All studies have shown an increased risk of UTI in
      uncircumcised males, with the greatest risk in infants
      younger than 1 year of age.</p>

      <p class="text2">Initial retrospective studies suggested that
      uncircumcised males were 10 to 20 times more likely to
      develop UTI than were circumcised male infants.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup></font> A review
      published in 1993 summarized the data from nine studies and
      reported that uncircumcised males had a 12.0-fold increased
      risk of UTI compared with circumcised infant males.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n69">69</a></sup></font> More recent
      studies using cohort and case-control design also support an
      association, although reduced in magnitude.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n63">63,64,67,70-72</a></sup></font>
      These studies have found a three to seven times increased
      risk of UTI in incircumcised male infants compared with that
      in circumcised male infants. This consistent association was
      found in samples from populations in which circumcision rates
      varied from low (&lt;20%),<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n67">67</a></sup></font> to medium (45%),<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n72">72</a></sup></font> to high
      (75%).<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n63">63,64</a></sup></font> One of these, a population
      based cohort <a href="/library/disease/UTI/to2/">study</a> of
      58,000 Canadian infants, found that the hospital admission
      rate for UTI in infant males younger than 1 year of age was
      1.88 per 1000 in circumcised infants and 7.02 per 1000, for a
      relative risk of 3.7.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n72">72</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">The proportion of male infants who have
      symptomatic UTI during the first year of life is somewhat
      difficult to estimate because the rate varies among studies.
      A study at an urban emergency department found that 2.5% of
      febrile male infants &lt;60 days of age had UTI.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n71">71</a></sup></font> Data from
      Europe, based on a largely uncircumcised population, report
      UTI rates of 1.2% for infant boys.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n73">73</a></sup></font> The number is similar to the
      rates of 0.7% to 1.4% reported for uncircumcised males in the
      United States and Canada.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n72">72,74</a></sup></font> In comparison, UTI rates
      for circumcised males are reported to be 0.12% to 0.19%
      Although these cross-cultural data do not provide information
      on specific individual risk factors, the similarity of rates
      for uncircumcised male infants support an association between
      circumcision status and UTI. Using these rates and the
      increased risks suggested from the literature, one can
      estimate that 7 to 14 of 1000 uncircumcised male infants will
      develop a UTI during the first year of life, compared with 1
      to 2 of 1000 circumcised male infants.</p>

      <p class="text2">Although all these studies have shown an
      increased risk of UTI in uncircumcised male infants, it is
      difficult to summarize and compare results because of
      differences in methodology, samples of infants studied,
      determination of circumcision status, method of urine
      collection, UTI definition, and assessment of confounding
      variables. Furthermore, in some studies, <span
      class="yellow">methods for determining the reliability of the
      data were not described.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Few of the studies have evaluated the
      association between UTI in male infants and circumcision
      status have looked at potential confounders (such as
      prematurity, <a
      href="/library/disease/UTI/pisacane/">breastfeeding</a>, and
      method of urine collection) in a rigorous way. For example,
      because premature infants appear to be at increased risk for
      UTI,<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n75">75-77</a></sup></font>
      the inclusion of hospitalized premature infants in a study
      population may act as a confounder by suggesting an increased
      risk of UTI in uncircumcised infants. Premature infants
      usually are not circumcised because of their fragile health
      status.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n78">78</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">In another example, <a
      href="/library/disease/UTI/pisacane1992/">breastfeeding was
      shown to have a threefold protective effect on the incidence
      of UTI in a sample of uncircumcised infants</a>. However,
      breastfeeding status has not been evaluated systematically in
      studies assessing UTI and circumcision status.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n79">79</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">One study suggested that the method used to
      obtain urine for culture may influence the rate of
      infection,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n64">64</a></sup></font> with the greatest risk for
      infection noted in uncircumcised male infants who had samples
      taken by catherization, compared with those who had samples
      obtained by catherization, compared with those who had
      samples obtained by suprapubic aspiration. The three methods
      of urine collection in male infants (suprapubic aspiration vs
      catheterization vs bag) vary significantly in their accuracy
      of diagnosing UTI. Suprapubic aspiration is considered the
      "gold standard" but may not be used in clinical practice for
      reasons of parent and physician preference as well as for
      efficiency.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n80">80,81</a></sup></font> No studies addressing the
      association between UTI and circumcision status have used
      suprapubic aspiration exclusively; one study, however, did
      use suprapubic aspiration in 92% of urine collections and
      noted a 10-fold increased risk of UTI in uncircumcised male
      infants compared with circumcised infants.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n66">66</a></sup></font> There are no
      studies comparing urine obtained by supapubic aspiration and
      urethral catheterization in uncircumcised males. In the only
      study comparing the accuracy of catheterization and
      suprapubic aspiration in a sample of 35 asymtomatic boys (1
      uncircumcised, 28 circumcised, and 6 with circumcision status
      not reported), the one false-positive urine sample with
      significant bacterial growth was abtained by catheterization
      of a 1-year-old uncircumcised male. A study in newborns
      demonstrated that urine sample obtained by bag technique is
      inadequate for diagnosing UTI in an uncircumcised male
      because of the high false-positive rate <font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n82">82</a></sup></font>; however, a
      negative bagged urinalysis and culture makes the diagnosis of
      UTI unlikely.</p>

      <p class="text2">There is a biologically plausible
      explanation for a relationship between an intact foreskin and

      periurethral bacterial colonization may be a risk factor for

      During the first 6 months of life, there are more
      uropathogenic organisms around the urethral meatus of
      uncircumcised infants than around that of circumcised male
      infants, but this decreases in both groups after the first 6
      months.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n65">65</a></sup></font>
      In addition, it was demonstrated in an experimental
      preparation that uropathogenic bacteria adhered to and
      readily colonized the mucosal surface of the foreskin, but
      did not adhere to the keratinized surface of the
      foreskin.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n70">70</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2"><a href="/library/disease/UTI/mccracken/">In

      may involve the possibility of an invasive procedure and

      during the first year of life; a circumcised male infant has
      an approximate 1 in 530 chance of being hospitalized for a
      UTI during the first year of life.</p>

      <p class="text2">In summary, all studies that have examined
      the association between UTI and circumcision status show an
      increased risk of UTI in uncircumcised males, with the
      greatest risk in infants younger than 1 year of age. The
      magnitude of the effect varies among studies. Using numbers
      from the literature, one can estimate that 7 to 14 of 1000
      uncircumcised male infants will develop a UTI during the
      first year of life, compared with 1 to 2 of 1000 circumcised
      male infants. Although the relative risk of UTI in
      uncircumcised male infants compared with circumcised male
      infants is increased from 4- to as much as 10-fold during the
      first year of life, the absolute risk of developing a UTI in
      an uncircumcised male infant is low (at most, ~1%)</p>

      CANCER<br />
       OF THE PENIS</a></b></p>

      <p class="text2">Cancer of the penis is a rare disease; the
      annual age-adjusted incidence of penile cancer is 0.9 to 1.0
      per 100 000 males in the United States.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n91">91</a></sup></font> In countries where the
      overwhelming majority of men are uncircumcised, the rate of
      cancer varies from 0.82 per 100 000 in Denmark<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n92">92</a></sup></font> to 2.9 to
      6.8 per 100 000 in Brazil<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n93">93</a></sup></font> and 2.0 to 10.5 per 100 000
      in India.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n94">94</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">The literature on the relationship between
      circumcision status and risk of squamous cell carcinoma of
      the penis (SCCP) is difficult to evaluate. Reports of several
      case series have noted a strong association with between
      uncircumcised status and increased risk for penile
      cancer<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n95">95-97</a></sup></font>; however, there have been
      few rigorous hypothesis-testing investigations. SCCP exists
      in both preinvasive (carcinoma in situ) and invasive
      forms.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n98">98</a></sup></font>
      Precancerous SCCP lesions and in situ SCCP ofter occur
      primarily on the shaft of the penis wheras invasive SCCP may
      be more likely to involve the glans. It is unclear whether
      preinvasive and invasive forms of SCCP are separate diseases
      or whether invasive SCCP develops from preinvasive SCCP.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n99">99</a></sup></font> This
      uncertainty makes analysing the literature difficult.
      Uncircumcised status has been strongly associated with
      invasive SCCP in multiple case series.</p>

      <p class="text2">The major risk factor for penile cancer
      across three case-control studies was phimosis. Other <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/vanhowe/">risk factors</a>
      include "previous genital condition," genital warts, &gt;30
      sexual partners, and cigarette smoking.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n100">100-102</a></sup></font> Two of the studies were
      conducted in areas of the world that do not practice neonatal
      circumcision. In the third study, in which 45% of the men had
      been circumcised as neonates, the risk of SCCP among men who
      were never circumcised was 3.2 times that of <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/vanhowe/">men who had been
      circumcised at birth</a>. This study did not analyze in situ
      and invasive SCCP separately. This study also used
      self-report to determine circumcision status. Self-report may
      not be an accurate method of determining circumcision
      status.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n103">103</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">The strength of the association between
      sexual behavior in the development of penile cancer is
      unclear. Although there is an association of <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/mccance/">human papilloma virus
      (HPV) DNA and genital warts with penile cancer</a>, the
      percentage of penile cancers with HPV DNA is lower than that
      of four other anogenital tumors (anus, cervix, vulva,
      vagina), implying that sexual transmission may be less of a
      factor in the genesis of SCCP than of these other
      cancers.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n104">104</a></sup></font> It may be that HPV is a
      co-factor for penile cancer, but that <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/harish/">other conditions</a>
      also must be present for progression to malignancy.</p>

      <p class="text2">Neonatal circumcision offers some protection
      from penile cancer; however, <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/bissada1/">circumcision at a
      later stage</a> does not seem to confer the same level of
      protection.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n105">105</a></sup></font> There is at least a
      three-fold increased risk of penile cancer in uncircumcised
      men; phimosis, a condition that exists only in uncircumcised
      men, increases the risk further.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n92">92,106</a></sup></font> The relationship among
      hygiene, phimosis, and penile cancer is uncertain, although
      many hypothesize that <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/frisch/">good hygiene prevents
      phimosis and penile cancer</a>.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n93">93</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">An annual penile cancer rate of 0.9 to 1.0
      per 100 000 translates to 9 to 10 cases per year per 1
      million men. Although the risk of developing penile cancer in
      an uncircumcised man compared with a circumcised man is
      increased more than three fold, it is difficult to estimate
      accurately the magnitude of this risk based on existing
      studies, Nevertheless, in a developed country such as the
      United States, penile cancer is a rare disease and the risk
      of penile cancer developing in an uncircumcised man, although
      increased compared with a circumcised man, is low.</p>

      related to STD may increase susceptibility to HIV in both

      href="#n115">115-117</a></sup></font> There does appear to be
      a plausible biologic explanation for this association in that
      the mucous surface of the uncircumcised penis allows for
      viral attachment to lymphoid cells at or near the surface of
      the mucous membrane, as well as an increased likelihood of
      minor abrasions resulting in increased HIV access to target
      tissues. However, behavioral factors appear to be far more

      <p align="center"><a id="ethics" name="ethics"></a><b><a
      href="/library/ethics/">ETHICAL ISSUES</a></b></p>

      <p class="text2">The practice of medicine has long respected
      an adult's right to self-determination in health care
      decision-making. This principle has been operationalized
      through the doctrine of informed consent. The process of <a
      target="_blank"
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/consent/">informed consent</a>
      obligates the physician to explain any procedure or treatment
      and to enumerate the risks, benefits, and alternatives for
      the patient to make an informed choice. For infants and young
      children who lack the capacity to decide for themselves, a
      surrogate, generally a parent must make such choices.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n118">118</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">Parents and physicians each have an <a
      href="/library/ethics/AAP/">ethical duty to the child</a> to
      attempt to secure the child's best interest and
      well-being.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n119">119</a></sup></font> However, it is often
      uncertain as to what is in the best interest of any
      individual patient. In cases such as the decision to perform
      a circumcision in the neonatal period when there are
      potential benefits and <a
      href="/library/complications/">risks</a> and the procedure is
      not essential to child's current well-being, it should be the
      parents who determine what is in the best interest of the
      child. In the pluralistic society of the United States in
      which parents are afforded wide authority for determining
      what constitutes appropriate child-rearing and child welfare,
      it is legitimate for the parents to take into account
      cultural, <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.circumcision.org/spectator.htm">religious</a>,
      and ethnic traditions, in addition to medical factors, when
      making this choice.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n119">119</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">Physicians counseling families concerning
      this decision should assist the parents by explaining the <a
      target="_blank"
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/consent/form.html">potential
      benefits and risks</a> and by ensuring that they understand
      that circumcision is an elective procedure. Parents should
      not be <a href="/pages/parents/protection/">coerced by
      medical professionals</a> to make this choice.</p>

      name="summary"></a><b>SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Existing scientific evidence demonstrates
      potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision;
      however, these data are not sufficent to recommend routine
      neonatal circumcision. In the case of circumcision, in which
      there are potential benefits and risks, yet <span
      class="yellow">the procedure is not essential to the child's
      current well-being</span>, parents should determine what is
      in the best interest of the child. To make an informed
      choice, parents of all male infants should be given accurate
      unbiased information and be provided the opportunity to
      discuss this decision. It is legitimate for parents to take
      into account cultural, religious, and ethnic traditions, in
      addition to the medical factors, when making this decision.
      Analgesia is safe and effective in reducing the procedural
      pain associated with circumcision; therefore if a decision
      <i>for</i> circumcision is made, <a
      href="/library/pain/lander/">procedural analgesia</a> should
      be provided. If circumcision is performed in the newborn
      period, it should only be done on infants who are stable and
      healthy.</p>
