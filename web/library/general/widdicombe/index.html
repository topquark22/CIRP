      <p class="text2">I remember you well, and am glad to hear
      that you are happily settled.</p>

      <p class="text2">Baby C is a fine specimen. He has the long
      non-retractile prepuce of the normal newborn male infant;
      that is not worrying him or obstructing the flow of urine he
      demonstrated to his own satisfaction and the discomfiture of
      one of my dressers. He will be circumcised at Minor
      Operations on Saturday; and his mother will be satisfied. I
      am not; and since I have had a short morning and dealt with
      all letters but yours, I feel inclined of an expert
      stenographer to send you an essay on Circumcision. What is
      the prepuce and why is it there? Why does Man remove it? Does
      routine circumcision do any good? Does it do any harm? What
      should be the attitude of the doctor towards this first step
      in surgical handicraft? These are some of the questions I
      should like to answer.</p>

      <p class="text2">The mammalian penis serves the double
      purpose of urination and generation. For the first purpose it
      remains flaccid, for the second it becomes rigid and
      elongated. Its shape, structure, and length vary widely in
      different species, but in all it is contained in a sheath,
      within which it remains while it is flaccid and from which it
      is protruded when erected for coitus. The human prepuce is
      the representative in Man of the sheath in other
      mammals&mdash;a covering protecting the glans penis, which is
      part of the mechanism of generation. The glans belongs to the
      group of special sense organs. It is almost insensitive to
      light touch, has no sense of tactile discrimination, and no
      appreciation of heat and cold, and it interprets painful
      stimuli (such as a pin prick) only as a vaguely unpleasant
      contact; but under appropriate stimulation it is capable of
      receiving pleasurable sensations that, when they have reached
      a certain pitch of intensity, take charge of the whole
      behaviour of the individual and lead to a series of
      uncontrollable actions that complete the important function
      of the life-cycle of the individual&mdash;the act of sexual
      union. The preservation, undulled and undiminished, of this
      special sense, and guarding of the mucous membrane in which
      it resides from long exposure and a dulling of its
      sensibility, is of paramount importance from the point of
      view of survival of the race. That then is the biological
      purpose of the prepuce.</p>

      <p class="text2">A second less important purpose is in the
      act of coitus itself. The erect uncircumcised penis enters
      the vagina without effort or any rate without friction, the
      prepuce unfolding as the penis advances and each part of it
      remaining in contact with successive areas of the vaginal
      walls, till finally the uncovered glans lies at the
      cervix.</p>

      <p class="text2">The circumcised penis, deprived of this
      self-tracking mechanism, is introduced to the accompaniment
      of friction between penile skin and vaginal mucous membrane.
      It is the difference between slipping the foot into a sock
      that has been rolled up and one that is held open at the
      top.</p>

      <p class="text2">The human foreskin, then, is neither
      vestigal nor useless. It is part of the normal mechanism of
      reproduction, and without it sexual desire is to some extent
      blunted, and the performance of the sexual act&mdash;at any
      rate the first act of coitus between the virgin male and the
      virgin female&mdash;made more difficult.</p>

      <p class="text2">Why is the operation of circumcision
      practised? As well ask: why do races all over the world make
      symbols of the egg and hare in the spring, the bonfire in the
      autumn and the evergreen tree in midwinter? The origins of
      circumcision at least can be traced. It is part of the ritual
      of mutilation by which the young male, and less often the
      young female, is called upon to suffer and give proof of
      courage, by which they are admitted to the privileges of the
      tribe or the estate of manhood or womanhood. In this respect
      it must be grouped with the various forms of tribal markings
      by burning or incision, with piercing or slitting of other
      prominent folds of skin, the ears, the lips, the nostrils. It
      is also performed to reduce sexual desire, to make the man a
      better warrior for his tribe, a more faithful husband to his
      wife, a less frequent disturber of the harmony of the society
      in which he lives. In Africa female circumcision is widely
      practised with the intention of making the woman chaste, a
      faithful wife and servant to her husband. The distribution of
      circumcision over the surface of the globe is irregular, and
      can be traced to the influence of the race, the conqueror
      imposing the practice on his subjects. Circumcision is
      universal in the Semitic races, and has been taken by the
      Arab to all the seacoasts of Africa and by the Jew to all
      parts of the world. The age at which it is practised also
      varies. Among the Jews and Arabs the male infant is
      circumcised soon after birth; among the central African
      tribes that practice circumcision (and many do not), the rite
      is performed every three or four years on all males who have
      reached puberty since the last circumcision, and these young
      men pass though the various stages of tribal life&mdash;the
      warrior, the parent, the farmer, the statesman, the priest -
      as one group known by the year of their circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">How often is circumcision necessary on
      surgical grounds? Here we must distinguish between
      circumcision in adult life, or at any rate after puberty, and
      circumcision in infancy. In the adult the unhealthy prepuce
      should be removed, and not sentimental embryological, racial
      or psychological arguments are strong enough to offset the
      general principle that unhealthy tissue should be removed.
      Circumcision in the adult should be performed for phimosis,
      for balanitis, for venereal or other preputial warts, and for
      early epithelioma as the first step in a course of treatment
      whose main plank is radiotherapy. True phimosis&mdash;that is
      a non-retractable and not mere a non-retracted
      prepuce&mdash;is seen only in adolescent and adult life. The
      infant prepuce cannot be retracted without force and should
      not be retracted but retraction comes normally in the years
      of childhood, without any maternal or medical assistance, and
      by puberty the non-retractable prepuce occurs in less than
      one in a hundred, and true phimosis&mdash;that is the prepuce
      with a fibrous stricture in the orifice&mdash;in perhaps one
      in a thousand.</p>

      <p class="text2">The reasons advanced for circumcision in
      infancy are a strange mixture of taboos handed down from the
      dawn of history, of Bible training, of midwives' and other
      oldwives' medicine, and of the unthinking advice of those
      storehouses of unexpurgated tradition, the surgical
      textbooks. The baby sent to outpatients is usually
      accompanied by a note to say he has phimosis (I was glad to
      see that you did not perjure yourself to this extent). Is
      there such a thing as a baby with phimosis? I am old enough
      to have taught your father, and I have never seen one. The
      penis is developed as a solid bud, prepuce and all, and the
      urethra is formed as an infolding of its under surface. Only
      late in foetal life does a line of cleavage appear to mark
      off the future prepuce from the future glans, and at birth
      this plane is a visible distinction but not a free space, and
      the newborn baby has a prepuce projecting at least half an
      inch beyond the new glans and forming a little corrugated
      tube, lie the empty oesophagus or anal canal. He passes water
      frequently and often. He may scream in doing so, but it does
      not follow that he has phimosis. Babies scream for all sorts
      of reasons, usually because they have a silly mother and
      "they know it teases." They may scream in passing water
      because it hurts, as it may in the urine is highly acid, but
      not because the outflow is obstructed at the preputial
      orifice. The urinary apparatus may be congenitally obstructed
      at the lower ends of the [illegible], in the prostatic
      urethra, at the meatus, but never at the prepuce.</p>

      <p class="text2">The shaky science of the arguments in favour
      of wholesale infant circumcision is often supported by the
      statement, itself unsupported by any by any scientific
      evidence, that the circumcised are less liable to disease,
      particularly that they are less likely to get venereal
      disease and cancer. The first statement is untrue. You were
      long enough in the Middle East to know that our circumcised
      allies were the most enthusiastic supporters of the VD
      departments. The second is true to the extent that cancer
      usually starts in the prepuce near the corona. But cancer of
      the penis is a rare disease. Five thousand men die every week
      in England, and only four of them die of penile cancer. The
      possible relation of the prepuce to the onset of venereal
      disease is that it may render the penis more liable to single
      or repeated trauma. But the penis protected by a normal
      retractile prepuce undergoes less trauma in coitus and less
      repeated irritation by exposure than the circumcised one.
      Disease is possibly commoner in the adult with phimosis than
      in the circumcised; but in the normal uncircumcised; it is if
      anything less common.</p>

      <p class="text2">Does circumcision in infancy do any harm?
      Undoubtedly. Firstly, like all operations that are looked on
      as easy, it is often very badly done. The Rabbinical method
      in the hands of the rabbi is safe, speedy and satisfactory;
      done by the Gentile working from a textbook description, it
      is one of the worst. Ritual circumcision depends on cutting
      off both layers in one sweep, and turning the cuff of mucous
      membrane down, when it is bandaged without sutures and
      allowed to unite. If the removal of skin has been inadequate,
      if the cuff of mucous membrane comes forward again as it
      often does and the two unite by granulation, the result is
      appalling, a half-length prepuce ending in a fibrotic ring
      attached to the glans half-way up.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision by proper surgical technique
      with trimming of the surfaces to the exact length and slope
      required, careful arrest of all haemorrhage, and suture of
      the cut edges with careful delicacy gives much better
      results; but may be disastrous in the hands of those who are
      not surgeons and know no technique. Unless the prepuce is
      freed completely from the glans before division, the meatus
      can be sliced off in the cut and a stricture that can never
      be overcome is produced.</p>

      <p class="text2">Apart from those evil results which are due
      to imperfect workmanship, there are the fairly common minor
      troubles that follow because a stupid and unnecessary
      operation has been done, a normal mechanism has been
      destroyed, and a delicate surface exposed to air and to
      friction four or five years before it should be exposed.
      Eczema of the glans and meatus is not rare in the newly
      circumcised infant; it needs careful treatment with ointment
      and sometimes leads to scarring and narrowing of the meatus.
      Those are the facts. But we must not break our hearts by
      putting two much of them into a fruitless crusade against
      infant circumcision. Fruitless it will be, for the medicine
      of the jungle and the witch doctor, the teaching of the Bible
      and Koran, the traditional science of the midwife, the health
      visitor, and the home medical dictionary are all against us.
      None the less, let us keep our own sanity. When we met those
      who advocate this mutilation, let us ask them why they do it
      and why: they have seldom asked themselves. When we meet a
      young mother whose mind is her own and not someone else's
      gramophone record, let us ask her if she thinks it likely
      that nature would bring 1000 English children into the world
      every day, well formed in all respects save this one; if it
      is no more likely that Nature is right and the folk-medicine
      that tries to improve on her is wrong. And when, as we often
      must, we have to give way to folly for the sake of peace and
      mind&mdash;our own, that of the mother, that of the school
      doctor&mdash;let us not commit the sin against the Holy Ghost
      by concealing from ourselves that it is foolish.</p>
