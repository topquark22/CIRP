      <h2>Rethinking Circumcision: Medical Intervention,<br />
       Religious Ceremony, or Genital Mutilation?</h2>

      <p class="author"><b>Marianne J. Legato, MD, FACP</b></p>

      <p><span class="init">A</span>lexander and Cheng's
      interesting and thoughtful discussion of female genital
      mutilation (FGM) in this issue's <i>Law, Ethics, and Gender
      in Medicine</i> column<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> made me
      think about the other side of the coin. What's morally and
      medically different between female genital mutilation and
      male genital mutilation (circumcision)? While most of us
      abhor the former, we freely practice the latter, and even
      surround it with celebration as a rite of passage here in the
      United States. Often, this surgical procedure is not even
      performed with the benefit of an anesthetic. (The custom of
      having the infant suck on a corner of a napkin dipped in wine
      or sugar water does not guarantee anesthesia.) And, like FGM,
      circumcision is often performed by laypersons and not
      physicians. When condemning mutilations endorsed by a
      particular society (that seem incomprehensible to us), it
      behooves us to take a good look at ourselves. It's quite
      likely that we countenance things we've accepted as harmless
      and even salubrious that might be interpreted quite
      differently by other cultures---and that we should rethink.
      In spite of the fact that the devastation incurred by the
      more extensive forms of FGM is usually (but not always)
      greater than that of most circumcisions, there are striking
      and absolute parallels between the two procedures.</p>

      <p class="text">Certainly humans have been performing male circumcision
      for awhile; reports indicate that the Egyptians practiced it
      as early as 4000 years before the birth of Christ.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> It has been perpetuated throughout the
      ages for various reasons, ranging from a Victorian notion
      that it would prevent masturbation, to the modern idea that
      the procedure improves hygiene and prevents disease in both
      the male and his sexual partners.</p>

      <p class="text">While opinions differ about whether circumcision should be
      a routine procedure, prestigious medical organizations have
      come down firmly against routine circumcision of the newborn.
      The Royal College of Surgeons of England released a <a
      href="/library/statements/RCS2001/">statement</a> on March 6,
      2001, that represented not only their own opinion, but also
      that of the British Association of Paediatric Surgeons and
      the Royal Colleges of Nursing, of Paediatrics and Child
      Health, and of Anaesthetists. These groups oppose the
      procedure, except in the case of scarring at the opening of
      the foreskin, which makes it nonretractable, an unusual
      condition that occurs before age five. The skin of the penis
      grows forward from the eighth week of gestation and
      eventually covers the glans; there is no separation between
      the two, and, in fact, the foreskin is often nonretractable
      until the age of three. The prepuce continues to develop
      after birth and spontaneously separates from the glans around
      the third year of life; by the time they are three, 90% of
      boys will have a retractable foreskin. The statement also
      points out that circumcision is a "surgical procedure like
      any other" and must be performed with adequate pain control,
      and be surrounded by the same precautions as any other
      surgical procedure (including that it should be done in an
      operating theater). Finally, as with any other operation, the
      infant should have postprocedural care, including pain
      control by medical professionals.</p>

      <p class="text">Circumcision is much more common in the United States than
      in other parts of the world; 1.2 million newborn males
      undergo the procedure annually in this country. This is in
      spite of the fact that the American Academy of Pediatrics
      began publishing statements on neonatal circumcision in 1971,
      and until its last revision was published in 1983, concluded
      that there was no absolute medical indication for performing
      the procedure routinely.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> The
      Academy's 1999 position paper reviewed the evidence-based
      medical data concerning circumcision and pointed out that a
      review of the literature suggested (but did not prove) that
      there is an increased risk for urinary tract infection (UTI)
      in uncircumcised babies under one year of age.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Based on their review, the Academy
      speculated that seven to 14 out of 1000 uncircumcised male
      infants will develop a UTI during the first 12 months of
      life, compared with one to two out of 1000 circumcised
      babies. However, the studies that were cited differed in
      methodology (methods of urine collection varied; suprapubic
      aspiration, catheterization, and collection by bag were all
      used), in the number of confounding variables (eg,
      prematurity), and even in the definition of a UTI. The
      putative protective effect of circumcision on the incidence
      of penile cancer was also difficult to demonstrate; penile
      cancer itself is a very rare disease, and there are only nine
      to 10 cases a year per one million men. The best estimate of
      risk in the uncircumcised male is that it may be increased
      threefold over the circumcised man, but the absolute
      incidence is still low. Finally, although some data suggest
      that circumcision offers protection from HIV, the Academy
      believes not only that the data on the co-incidence of HIV
      and circumcision are "conflicting and complex" but also that
      behavioral factors are much more immediately and
      significantly important in contracting HIV infection. The
      statement concludes that there are no compelling medical data
      to support a recommendation for routine neonatal
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text">An article published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>
      in 2000 contending that male circumcision protects against
      HIV infection<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> was met with a
      storm of protests from readers. One of the more trenchant
      comments came from American physicians:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          HIV transmission is heavily dependent on certain sexual
          behaviours, not anatomy. The authors have not provided
          any new information to alter this fact but have taken the
          discussion off on a needless tangent. Indiscriminate mass
          circumcision, which is currently popularized by some
          Western researchers... does not address the core
          behavioural issues that have fueled this pandemic.
          Therefore, it will not alter the course of AIDS in
          Africa.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>More recent data about the possible health benefits of
      circumcision include a meta-analysis of seven studies from
      five countries exploring its impact on the incidence of
      either human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in the male or
      cervical cancer in the female. Not only were circumcised men
      less likely to have HPV infection than their uncircumcised
      counterparts (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval;
      0.16-0.85), but women who had intercourse with men with a
      history of six or more sexual partners were less likely to
      have cervical cancer if their partners were
      circumcised.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> Even if one argues
      that circumcision lowers the incidence of HPV infection in
      the male and cervical cancer in his partner, and/or makes the
      male genitals "easier to keep clean," these points of view
      fail to address the unfortunate and virtually universal
      assumption of most people, until quite recently, that it is
      fine to administer the procedure without the benefit of an
      anesthetic. Many people assume that, because a child is
      small, he feels no significant degree of pain. Yet, we know
      that this is not a fact and that even a fetus can experience
      discomfort.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> The outraged (read
      anguished) cry of the baby being circumcised is generally
      laughed off by those who surround it with the panoply of
      ritual and celebration; not unlike what our law column
      authors describe in some African societies when performing
      FGM. The situation is not as benign as it may seem; the
      babies' responses to circumcision without analgesia include
      well-documented changes in heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen
      saturation, and serum cortisol levels.<a
      href="#n9"><sup>9-12</sup></a></p>

      <p class="text">A fascinating document by researcher Jacqueline Smith, at
      the Netherlands Institute of Human Rights, addresses the
      contention of many that to compare FGM to circumcision is to
      trivialize FGM.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> On the
      contrary, although the former is a more extensive procedure,
      both surgeries involve genital mutilation. Ms. Smith comments
      on the decision of the <a
      href="http://www.law.uu.nl/english/sim/"
      target="_blank">Netherlands Institute of Human Rights</a> to
      address, study, and make recommendations only on the subject
      of FGM, and not to consider a statement on male genital
      mutilation (MGM) or circumcision because, as she states:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          The choice to make a dissociation between the two
          practices was at that time a pragmatic, political
          decision, related to the vehement discussion in the
          Netherlands and because the fight against female genital
          mutilation would be more difficult if male circumcision
          were also to be challenged.
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>She points out that male circumcision, as fully as FGM, is
      a breach of the "universally accepted human rights and rights
      of the child," citing the <a href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/" target="_blank">Convention on the Rights of the
      Child</a>, which prohibits torture or other "cruel, inhuman or
      degrading treatment or punishment," and urges in Article 24
      that governments take "all effective and appropriate measures
      with a view of abolishing traditional practices prejudicial
      to the health of children."</p>

      <p class="text">Enlarging on the legal and moral issues that surround
      circumcision, Australian David Richards comments on the fact
      that all humans have a right to bodily integrity and that
      parental permission for medical treatment must be grounded in
      the assumption that the treatment will result in a benefit
      that supercedes the negative of invading a child's personal
      integrity. Richards comments that female circumcision is
      likely to be prohibited in Australia in the near future and
      that it is "illogical that male circumcision has not been
      considered with this prohibition. Surgical cutting and
      disfiguring of a healthy genital organ is consistent with
      both male and female circumcision."<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">Whatever the benefits of male circumcision may turn out to
      be---none, some, or significant---they seem so far only to
      involve adult sexual behavior. A decision by an adult male to
      be circumcised might be quite appropriate once he has
      considered his own individual circumstances and the risks and
      benefits of the procedure. But that is quite different than
      subjecting a neonate to the procedure, where no clear health
      benefit has been established.</p>

      <p class="text">My favorite pediatrician and a Partnership scholar, George
      Lazarus, MD, does not agree that circumcision is without
      health benefits to the male and even to his female partners,
      but commented that the most frequent reason babies are
      circumcised is "to look like Dad." Surely we can do better
      than that. The unquestioning acceptance of routine
      circumcision of a newborn, including religious purposes,
      deserves a hard look and wide-ranging debate.</p>
