      <h2>Male circumcision in Britain:<br />
       findings from a national probability sample survey</h2>

      <p class="text1">Studies from developing countries<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> and sexually transmitted diseases
      clinics in developed countries<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      show that male circumcision appears to protect against some
      ulcerative sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and
      decreases the risk of HIV infection.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> We used data from the 2000 British
      National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal
      2000)&mdash;a large scale, stratified, probability sample
      survey&mdash;to estimate the prevalence of male circumcision
      in Britain and investigate its association with key
      demographic characteristics, sexual behaviours, and reported
      STI diagnosis. Natsal 2000 methodology details are published
      elsewhere.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> For the purposes of
      this investigation, data from targeted oversampling of black
      Caribbean, black African, Indian, and Pakistani groups (the
      Natsal ethnic minority boost) were combined with the main
      survey data in order to increase the numbers of these
      respondents included in the analysis. All data were weighted
      to be representative of the British population and analyses
      were performed using Stata version 6.0 to take into
      consideration Natsal 2000&rsquo;s complex survey
      design.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">We found 15.8% (95% confidence interval (CI)
      14.7 to 17.1) of British men aged 16&ndash;44 years reported
      being circumcised in Natsal 2000. Age specific prevalence was
      greatest among men aged 40&ndash;44 years (19.6%, 95% CI 16.8
      to 22.7) compared to those aged 16&ndash;19 years (11.7%, 95%
      CI 9.0 to 15.2). With the exception of black Caribbeans, men
      from all ethnic minority backgrounds were signifi-cantly more
      likely to report being circumcised compared to men who
      described their ethnicity as white ((adjusting for
      demographic variables: age, global region of birth,
      ethnicity, residence in London, religion, and qualifications)
      adjusted odds ratio (OR) for self reporting ethnicity as
      other than white 3.02, 95% CI 2.39 to 3.81, p...0.001). In
      addition, men born abroad instead of in Britain were
      significantly more likely to be circumcised ((adjusting for
      demographic variables: age, global region of birth,
      ethnicity, residence in London, religion, and qualifications)
      adjusted OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.42, p...0.001).
      Significant (p...0.001) variations in the prevalence of
      circumcision were also observed across the major religious
      groups, with prevalence being greatest among Jewish men
      (98.7%, 95% CI 90.1 to 99.8) and lowest among Hindus, Sikhs,
      and Buddhists (9.8%, 95% CI 4.7 to 9.3). <span
      class="yellow">Relative to uncircumcised men, circumcised men
      were more likely to report having had homosexual partner(s)
      (7.5% v 5.3%, p =0.012) and partners from abroad (19.7% v
      13.1%, p...0.001).</span></p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">We did not find any
      significant differences in the proportion of circumcised and
      uncircumcised British men reporting ever being diagnosed with
      any STI (11.1% compared with 10.8%, p =0.815), bacterial STIs
      (6.4% cf 5.9%, p =0.628), or viral STIs (4.7% cf 4.5%, p
      =0.786) (table 1). We also found no significant associations
      between circumcision and being diagnosed with any one of the
      seven specific STIs.</span></p>

      <center>

      </center>

      <p class="text2">Our findings confirm that the prevalence of
      male circumcision among British men appears to be declining.
      This is despite an increase in the proportion of the British
      population describing their ethnicity as non-white.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> The lack of association between
      circumcision status and STI history in this population is
      consistent with findings from other developed
      countries<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> and may be because of
      relatively low prevalence of STIs in this setting, as well as
      the relatively small proportion of the population who are
      circumcised.</p>
