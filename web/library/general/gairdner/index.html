        <h2>THE FATE OF THE FORESKIN</h2>

        <h4>A STUDY OF CIRCUMCISION</h4>

        <p><i>By</i><br />
         <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Gairdner"
        target="_blank">DOUGLAS GAIRDNER</a>, D.M.,
        M.R.C.P.</i><br />

        Hospitals</i></p>
      </center>

      <p class="justify">It is a curious fact that one of the
      operations most commonly performed in this country is also
      accorded the least critical consideration. In order to decide
      whether a child's foreskin should be ablated the normal
      anatomy and function of the structure at different ages
      should be understood; the danger of conserving the foreskin
      must then be weighed against the hazards of the operation,
      the mortality and after-effects of which must be known.
      Though tens of thousands of infants are circumcised each year
      in this country, nowhere are these essential data assembled.
      The intention of this paper is to marshal the facts required
      by those concerned with deciding the fate of the child's
      foreskin.</p>

      <center>
        <h3>Origins of Circumcision</h3>
      </center>

      <p class="text1">Male circumcision, often associated with
      analogous sexual mutilations of the female such as clitoric
      circumcision and infibulation, is practised over a wide area
      of the world by some one-sixth of its population. Over the
      Near East, patchily throughout tribal Africa, amongst the
      Moslem peoples of India and of South-East Asia, and amongst
      the Australasian aborigines circumcision has been regularly
      practised for as long as we can tell. Many of the natives
      that Columbus found inhabiting the American continent were
      circumcised. The earliest Egyptian mummies (2300 B.C.) were
      circumcised, and wall paintings to be seen in Egypt show that
      it was customary several thousand years earlier still.</p>

      <p class="text2">According to Elliot Smith circumcision is
      one of the characteristic features of a "heliolithic" culture
      which, some 15,000 years ago, spread out over much of the
      world; others believe that the practice must have arisen
      independently among different peoples. In spite of the
      enormous literature on the subject (well summarized in
      Hasting's <i>Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics</i>), we
      remain profoundly ignorant of the origins and significance of
      this presumably sacrificial rite. The age at which boys are
      circumcised varies widely in different races, from the Mosaic
      practice of circumcising at about the eighth day, to the
      custom in many African tribes of making circumcision part of
      an initiation ceremony near the age of puberty. Circumcision
      was introduced into Roman Europe with Christianity; little is
      known about its status in mediaeval Europe, but it was
      probably customary only amongst adherents of the Jewish faith
      until, with the rise of modern surgery in the nineteenth
      century, its status changed from a religious rite to that of
      a common surgical procedure.</p>

      <center>
        <h3>Development of the Prepuce</h3>
      </center>

      <p class="text1">The prepuce appears in the foetus at eight
      weeks as a ring of thickened epidermis (Fig. 1, a) which
      grows forwards over the base of the glans penis (Fig. 1, b).
      It grows more rapidly on the upper surface than the lower,
      and so leaves the inferior aspect of the preputial ring
      deficient (Hunter, 1935). At 12 weeks the urethra still opens
      on the inferior aspect of the shaft of the penis and the
      terminal part of the urethra has yet to be constructed.
      Arrest at this stage produces the glandular type of
      hypospadias, with the ``hooded'' prepuce only partially
      covering the glans.</p>

      <center>
        <p><img src="figure1.gif"
        alt="Preputial Development" /><br />
         <font size="2">Fig. 1. - Development of prepuce (a) Eight
        weeks; (b) sagittal section and (c) coronal section, 12
        weeks; (d) 16 weeks; (e) at about term, compare Fig.
        3.</font></p>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">From the inferior aspect of the glans a pair
      of outgrowths are pushed out and meet (the sulcus on the
      under aspect of the glans marks their fusion), so enclosing a
      tube which, becoming continuous with the existing urethra,
      advances the meatus to its final site. These outgrowths from
      the glans carry with them the prepuce on each side (Fig. 1,
      c), thus completing the prepuce inferiorly and forming the
      frenulum.</p>

      <p class="text2">By 16 weeks the prepuce has grown forwards
      to the tip of the glans. At this stage (Fig. 1, d) the
      epidermis of the deep surface of the prepuce is continuous
      with the epidermis covering the glans, both consisting of
      squamous epithelium. By a process of desquamation the
      preputial space is now formed in the following manner (<a
      href="/library/anatomy/deibert/">Deibert, 1933</a>). In
      places the squamous cells arrange themselves in whorls,
      forming epithelial cell nests. The centres of these
      degenerate, so forming a series of spaces (Fig. 1, e); these,
      as they increase in size, link up until finally a continuous
      preputial space is formed. The stage of development which has
      been reached by the time the child is born varies greatly.
      Figs. 2, 3, and 4 show sections of the penis in three
      full-term newborn infants; in Fig. 2 separation of the
      prepuce has not yet begun; in Fig. 3 separation is partial;
      in Fig. 4 separation is complete, though this, as will be
      shown, is uncommon at birth.</p>

        <h3>Anatomy of the Prepuce</h3>
      </center>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: <font color="red">Caution:</font>
      Later studies have shown that Dr Gairdner's figures for
      increasing retractability after birth are not correct. See <a
      href="/library/normal/">Normal Development of the Prepuce</a>
      for more information.]</p>

      <p class="justify"><i>The Younger Child.</i>-The prepuce is
      still in the course of developing at the time of birth, and
      the fact that its separation is usually still incomplete
      renders the normal prepuce of the newborn non-retractable.
      (It will be seen that preputial "adhesions" is an inapposite
      term to apply to the incompletely separated prepuce,
      suggesting as it does that the prepuce and glans were
      formerly separate structures.) The age at which complete
      separation of the prepuce with full retractability
      spontaneously occurs is shown in Fig. 5, which has been
      constructed from observations of the prepuce in a series of
      100 newborns and about 200 boys of varying ages up to 5
      years. Of the newborns, 4% had a fully retractable prepuce,
      in 54% the glans could be uncovered enough to reveal the
      external meatus, and in the remaining 42% even the tip of the
      glans could not be uncovered. Of the older group 10% had been
      circumcised and a few had at some time had their prepuce
      "stretched"; the figures from which the diagram is
      constructed are therefore not precise, but they indicate with
      sufficient accuracy that the prepuce is
      <i>non-retractable</i> in four out of five normal males of 6
      months and in half of normal males of 1 year. By 2 years
      about 20% and by 3 years about 10% of boys still have a
      non-retractable prepuce.</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="figure5.gif" alt="graph" /></p>
      <br />
       Fig. 5. - Proportion of boys of varying ages from birth to 5
      years, in whom the prepuce has spontaneously become
      retractable. Note that it is uncommon for this to occur in
      the first six months. 

      <p class="text2">The fact that at these ages
      non-retractability depends upon incomplete separation of the
      prepuce can be easily demonstrated by running a probe round
      the preputial space, gently completing its continuity. It
      will then be found that, although the prepuce is often
      somewhat tighter than in the adult, it is not tight enough to
      prevent retraction. This test was applied to a series of 54
      boys aged from 2 months to 3 years who had been referred to
      hospital for circumcision, generally with a diagnosis of
      phimosis. In 53 of the 54 the prepuce became easily
      retractable by this simple manipulation; in one 5-months-old
      infant this manoeuvre failed because preputial separation had
      not advanced far enough to enable manipulation to complete
      the process. Although in this way the prepuce of nearly every
      infant can be rendered retractable, the procedure,
      necessarily involving the tearing apart of two as yet
      incompletely separated surfaces, causes some bleeding and
      opens the way to possible infection. For these reasons it is
      inadvisable as a routine procedure.</p>

      <p class="text1"><i>Prepuce of the Older Child.</i> - Of 200
      uncircumcised boys aged 5-13 years from three different
      schools, 6% had a non-retractable prepuce; in a further 14%
      the prepuce could be only partially retracted. In the
      majority of boys in this age group non-retractability depends
      upon the persistence of a few strands of tissue between
      prepuce and glans, so that minimal force is required to
      achieve retractability. In this age group, however,
      retraction of a hitherto unretracted prepuce discovers
      inspissated smegma, which, in contrast to that found in the
      younger child, is in some cases malodorous. This, together
      with the facts discussed under penile cancer, indicates that
      a different view ought to be taken of the non-retractable
      prepuce in the child over about 5 years, and that, whereas a
      non-retractable prepuce in the young child should be accepted
      with equanimity as normal, after about 3 years of age steps
      should be taken to render the prepuce of all boys retractable
      and capable of being kept clean.</p>

      <center>
        <h3>Function of the Prepuce</h3>
      </center>

      <p class="text1">It is often stated that the prepuce is a
      vestigial structure devoid of function. However, it seems to
      be no accident that during the years when the child is
      incontinent the glans is completely clothed by the prepuce,
      for, deprived of this protection, the glans becomes
      susceptible to injury from contact with sodden clothes or
      napkin. Meatal ulcer is almost confined to circumcised male
      infants, and is only occasionally seen in the uncircumcised
      child when the prepuce happens to be unusually lax and the
      glans consequently exposed (<a
      href="/library/complications/freud1/">Freud, 1947</a>).</p>

      <center>
        <h3>Incidence of Circumcision</h3>
      </center>

      <p class="text1">Amongst the Western nations the circumcision
      of infants is a common practice only with the
      English-speaking peoples. It is, for the most part, not the
      custom in continental Europe or Scandinavia, or in South
      America. In England the collected data of various colleagues*
      who have kindly made observations on infants,
      school-children, and university students reveal wide
      variations as between different districts and between
      different social classes. For instance, in
      Newcastle-upon-Tyne 12% of 500 male infants aged 12 months
      were circumcised; in Cambridge the comparable figure was 31%
      of 89 male infants aged 6 to 12 months. Boys coming from the
      upper classes are more often circumcised, 67% of 81
      13-year-old boys entering a public school had been
      circumcised, whereas only 50% of 154 boys aged 5 to 14 in
      primary and secondary schools in the rural districts of
      Cambridgeshire, and 30% of 141 boys aged 5 to 11 in primary
      schools in the town of Cambridge, had been circumcised. The
      influence of social class is shown also by some figures
      analysed by Sir Alan Rook from a group of university
      students. Whereas 84% of 73 students coming from the
      best-known public schools had been circumcised, this was so
      of only 50% of 174 coming from grammar or secondary schools.
      Either the boys of well-to-do parents are suffering
      circumcision much too often, or those of poorer parents not
      often enough.</p>

      <p class="text2">In view of the wide difference in the
      incidence of circumcised males in different parts of the
      country, it is difficult to give an average figure for the
      whole country. A conservative estimate of 20%, which is above
      the rate for Newcastle-upon-Tyne but well below that for all
      the other groups quoted, would mean that the number of
      circumcisions performed on children in England and Wales is
      of the order of 90,000 annually.</p>

      <center>
        <h3>Mortality and Sequelae of Circumcision</h3>
      </center>

      <p class="justify">Circumcision, like any other operation, is
      subject to the risks of haemorrhage and sepsis, and, where a
      general anaesthetic is employed, to the risk of anaesthetic
      death. The number of deaths presumed to be due to these
      causes is shown in the accompanying Table. The
      Registrar-General groups circumcision and phimosis together,
      but in view of the fact that "phimosis," as the term is
      commonly applied to infants, is physiological (see below) it
      is probable that the great majority of these deaths were
      attributable to operation rather than to any pathological
      condition necessitating operation.</p>

      <p class="text2">About 16 deaths in children under 5 years
      occur each year from circumcision. In most of the fatalities
      which have come to my notice death has occurred for no
      apparent reason under anaesthesia, but haemorrhage and
      infection have sometimes proved fatal.</p>

      <p class="text2">Haemorrhage is not uncommon after
      circumcision. F. J. W. Miller and S. D. Court (1949, personal
      communication), who followed 1,000 infants in
      Newcastle-upon-Tyne for their first year, found that 58 were
      circumcised, and two of these bled sufficiently to require
      blood transfusion. In my own experience about two out of
      every 100 children circumcised as hospital out-patients will
      be admitted on account of haemorrhage or other untoward
      event. Blood losses in the first year are particularly apt to
      lead to anaemia, and several infants have been seen with
      severe iron-deficiency anaemia following haemorrhages after
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Reference has already been made to meatal
      ulcer, which, in so far as it is so much more frequent in
      circumcised male infants, should be counted a sequel of the
      operation.</p>

      <center>
        <h3>Pathological Conditions of Prepuce for which
        Circumcision is Performed</h3>
      </center>

      <p class="justify">The surprising variety of reasons why
      different doctors advise circumcision and other operations
      and manipulations on the prepuce can be found described in
      the long correspondence on the subject which ran in the
      British Medical Journal from August to November, 1935.
      Circumcision is sometimes undertaken in order to cure
      existing pathological conditions, sometimes in order to
      prevent various diseases from occurring at a much later
      date.</p>

      <center>
        <b>Phimosis</b>
      </center>

      <p class="justify">Since in the newborn infant the prepuce is
      nearly always non-retractable, remaining so generally for
      much of the first year at least, and since this normal
      non-retractability is not due to tightness of the prepuce
      relative to the glans but to incomplete separation of these
      two structures, it follows that phimosis (which implies a
      pathological constriction of the prepuce) cannot properly be
      applied to the infant. Further, the commonly performed
      manipulation known as "stretching the foreskin" by forcibly
      opening sinus forceps inserted in the preputial orifice
      cannot be justified on anatomical grounds, besides being
      painful and traumatizing. In spite of the fact that the
      preputial orifice often appears minute - the so-called
      pin-hole meatus - its effective lumen, when tested by noting
      whether or not a good stream of urine is passed, is almost
      invariably found to be adequate.</p>

      <p class="text2">Infants with umbilical or inguinal hernia
      are particularly liable to suffer circumcision on account of
      ``phimosis,'' but if this simple test is applied, rarely will
      any obstruction to the urinary flow be found present.
      Occasionally the preputial orifice is imperfectly related to
      the external meatus, so that the urinary stream balloons out
      the subpreputial space; this can be easily remedied by gently
      separating the prepuce from the glans in the region of the
      meatus by means of a probe. True phimosis causing urinary
      obstruction has been described (Campbell, l948), but must be
      exceedingly rare: in the cases I have seen in which this
      diagnosis has been made, simple separation of the prepuce has
      shown that there was no constriction of the preputial
      tributable to operation rather than to any pathological
      orifice.</p>

      <p class="text2">Through ignorance of the anatomy of the
      prepuce in infancy, mothers and nurses are often instructed
      to draw the child's foreskin back regularly, on the
      supposition that stretching of the foreskin is what is
      required. I have on three occasions seen young boys with a
      paraphimosis caused by mothers or nurses who have obediently
      carried out such instructions; for, although the size of the
      prepuce does allow the glans to be delivered, the fit is
      often a close one and slight swelling of the glans, such as
      may result from forceful efforts at retraction, may make its
      reduction difficult.</p>

      <center>
        <b>Balanitis and Posthitis</b>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Inflammation of the glans is uncommon in
      childhood when the prepuce is performing its protective
      function. Posthitis - inflammation of the prepuce - is
      commoner, and it occurs in two forms. One form is a
      cellulitis of the prepuce; this responds well to chemotherapy
      and does not seem to have any tendency to recur; hence it is
      questionable whether circumcision is indicated. More often
      inflammation of the prepuce is part of an ammonia dermatitis
      affecting the napkin area. The nature of this condition was
      firmly established by Cooke in 1921, bit is still not
      universally known. The urea-splitting <i>Bact.
      ammoniagenes</i> (derived from faecal flora) acts upon the
      urea in the urine and liberates ammonia. This irritates the
      skin, which becomes peculiarly thickened, while superficial
      desquamation produces a silvery sheen on the skin as if it
      were covered with a film of tissue paper. Such appearances
      are diagnostic of ammonia dermatitis, and inquiry will
      confirm that the napkins, particularly those left on through
      the longer night interval, smell powerfully of ammonia.
      Treatment consists in impregnating the napkins with a mild
      antiseptic inhibiting the growth of the urea-splitting
      organisms. For this purpose boric acid powder sprinkled over
      the napkins, or a rinse of 1 in 4,000 mercuric chloride or of
      the recently introduced non-toxic substance "diaparene"
      (Benson <i>et al.</i>, 1949), are gratifyingly effective.</p>

      <p class="text2">When involved in an ammonia dermatitis the
      prepuce shows the characteristic thickening of the skin, and
      this is often labelled a "redundant prepuce" - another
      misnomer which may serve as a reason for circumcision. The
      importance of recognizing ammonia dermatitis lies in the
      danger that if circumcision is performed the delicate glans,
      deprived of its proper protection, is particularly apt to
      share in the inflammation and to develop a meatal ulcer. Once
      formed, a meatal ulcer is often most difficult to cure.</p>

      <center>
        <b>Enuresis</b>
      </center>

      <p class="justify">A number of symptoms of obscure cause,
      such as enuresis, masturbation, habit spasm, night terrors,
      or even convulsions, have from time to time been attributed
      to phimosis, and circumcision has been advised. No evidence
      exists that a prepuce whose only fault is that it has not yet
      developed retractability can cause such symptoms.</p>

      <p class="text2">It may be apposite at this stage to quote
      the reasons given by the mother for desiring her child's
      circumcision in a series of 54 infants referred to hospital
      by a doctor. In 39 infants the reason was a symptomless
      ``phimosis'' found on routine inspection by doctor, nurse,
      mother, or neighbour. In nine cases it was said that ``he
      cries when he wets'': five of these proved to be due to
      ammonia dermatitis; closer questioning of the others revealed
      either no connexion between when the baby cried and when he
      urinated, or merely that crying often started micturition. In
      these three cases the foreskin was judged to be too long or
      redundant, and in a further three the reason was even more
      frankly cosmetic ("it looks funny") or was intangible ("we
      believe in it"). As has been stated earlier, in all except
      one of this group of 54 infants, phimosis was disproved, in
      so far as gentle manipulation enabled the prepuce to be
      retracted.</p>

      <center>
        <h3>Conditions Prevented by Circumcision</h3>
      </center>

      <p class="justify">Universal circumcision of male infants has
      been urged as a means of preventing the later development of
      a variety of conditions - paraphimosis, venereal diseases,
      penile cancer, and cervical cancer of women.</p>

      <center>
        <b>Paraphimosis</b>
      </center>

      <p class="justify">Some idea of the importance of
      paraphimosis can be gained from figures from the Royal
      Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, a hospital serving a
      large population in which, as has been mentioned, infants are
      circumcised less often than in the country generally. In the
      children's wards paraphimosis accounts for about seven out of
      a total of 800 male child admissions each year (0.9%); an
      appreciable number of these are found to be the result of the
      mother's obeying misguided instructions to retract her
      infant's prepuce forcibly. In the adult wards it accounts for
      about 10 out of a total of 5,000 male surgical admissions
      (0.1%), so that paraphimosis scarcely constitutes an
      important hazard to the uncircumcised male.</p>

      <center>
        <b>Venereal Disease</b>
      </center>

      <p class="justify">Although there is a common belief that the
      circumcised man runs a lessened risk of venereal infection,
      particularly syphilitic, there are few figures to support
      this. Lloyd and Lloyd (1934), who reviewed the published
      evidence and analysed their own figures, concluded that
      circumcision did not diminish the chance of a syphilitic
      chancre. Schrek and Lenowitz (1947) found that hospital
      patients gave a history of venereal disease equally often
      whether circumcised or not. Wilson (1947) has published
      figures showing that, of the men attending a Canadian Army
      venereal disease centre, the proportion of uncircumcised
      solders (77%) was higher than in the Canadian Army generally
      (52%), and concluded that the uncircumcised soldier is more
      prone to venereal infection. It may be, however, that since
      circumcision of infants is <i>de rigueur</i> in Canada, the
      uncircumcised man will tend to come from a lower social grade
      and thus to be more likely to expose himself to infection.
      The evidence seems scarcely to warrant universal circumcision
      as a prophylactic against venereal infection.</p>

      <center>
        <b>Penile Cancer</b>
      </center>

      <p class="justify">This subject merits careful appraisal, for
      it alone, of the medical reasons commonly advanced for the
      universal circumcision of infants is capable of withstanding
      critical scrutiny. In England and Wales deaths from penile
      cancer number about 150 a year. The relation between this
      disease and antecedent circumcision has recently been
      reviewed by Kennaway (1947). All observers agree that
      circumcision in the first five years of life protects
      absolutely from penile cancer, and this applies not only to
      one group such as the Jewish but equally to the mixed races
      of the U.S.A. The reason for this preventive effect of early
      circumcision is not known: it is not due to removal of the
      cancer-bearing area since the usual site of penile cancer,
      the sulcus behind the glans, is retained. If it is due to
      retained smegma or its decomposition products being
      carcinogenic, this effect must be of startling potency, since
      circumcision after the fifth year fails to prevent cancer
      occurring several decades later.</p>

      <p class="text2">A clue to the problem may lie in the
      exceptionally low hygienic standards of patients with penile
      cancer, which has struck several observers. Dean (1935),
      reviewing 120 cases, writes: "Men with penis cancers gave the
      impression of being less intelligent, as a class, than other
      cancer patients. Not only had the majority ignored for long
      periods the precancerous state of physical annoyance, filth,
      and odoriferous discharges, but also it was not unusual for
      many to delay seeking advice until a large part of the penis
      bad become affected with an ulcerating growth." The unusual
      frequency with which patients with penile cancer have had
      venereal disease has been demonstrated by Dean (1935) and by
      Schrek and Lenowitz (1947), these authors having come to the
      conclusion that this fact indicates again the significantly
      low standard of social hygiene of these patients. A further
      factor frequently present in patients with penile cancer is
      phimosis; although this is often the result of the growth, in
      many patients the prepuce has never been retractable (Lewis,
      1931).</p>

      <p class="text2">With these facts it may reasonably be
      contended that, if the uncircumcised male has a prepuce which
      he can retract and which he keeps clean, he is likely to
      enjoy the same immunity from penile cancer as his circumcised
      brother.</p>

      <center>
        <b>Cervical Cancer In Women</b>
      </center>

      <p class="justify">The low incidence of cervical cancer among
      Jewesses has led Handley (1947) to the conclusion that this
      disease is mainly caused by the introduction of irritant
      material by the uncircumcised husband during coitus. It
      should be a simple matter to put this theory to the test by
      noting whether the husbands of women with cervical cancer are
      more frequently uncircumcised than others. Meanwhile the
      evidence seems insufficient to warrant universal circumcision
      or preputiotomy, such as Handley advocates.</p>

      <center>
        <b>Minor Advantages of Circumcision</b>
      </center>

      <p class="justify">There remain a number of more or less
      trivial factors which are sometimes mentioned as reasons why
      infant circumcision is desirable: difficulties in keeping the
      uncircumcised parts clean, or the supposed aesthetic or
      erotic superiority of the shorn member. In order to fulfil
      the intention of this paper an inquiry on these points should
      have been made amongst a group of uncircumcised men. This was
      not attempted, although with regard to the last two of the
      factors mentioned it should be stated that whenever the
      subject has been broached in male company those still in
      possession of their foreskin have been forward in their
      insistence that any differences which may exist in such
      matters operate emphatically to their own advantage.</p>

      <p class="text2">Moreover, if there were sensible
      disadvantages in being uncircumcised, one would expect that
      the fathers of candidates for circumcision would sometimes
      register their feelings in the matter. Yet in interviewing
      the parents of several hundred infants referred for
      circumcision I have met but one father who wished his son
      circumcised because of his disagreeable experience of the
      uncircumcised state. The rest of the fathers were equally
      indifferent about the matter whether they themselves had been
      circumcised or not. Indeed, so little did the father's
      personal experience seem important that one-quarter of the
      mothers did not even know whether their husbands were or were
      not circumcised. These facts provide some evidence that few
      uncircumcised men have cause to regret their state.</p>

      <center>
        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
      </center>

      <p class="justify">It has been shown that, since during the
      first few year of life the prepuce is still in process of
      developing, it is impossible at this period to determine in
      which infants the prepuce will attain normal retractability.
      In fact, only about 10% will fail to attain this by the age
      of 3 years. Of this 10% of 3-year-old boys, in most it will
      be found a simple matter to render the prepuce retractable by
      completing its separation from the glans by gentle
      manipulation. In a very few this may prove impossible and
      circumcision might then be considered a justifiable
      precaution.* * Higgins (1949), with long experience of
      paediatric urology, also concludes that circumcision should
      not be considered until "after the age of, say, 2 to 3
      years."</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The prepuce of the
      young infant should therefore be left in its natural
      state.</span> As soon as it becomes retractable, which will
      generally occur some time between 9 months and 3 years, its
      toilet should be included in the routine of bath time, and
      soap and water applied to it in the same fashion as to other
      structures, such as the ears, which are customarily treated
      with special assiduousness on account of their propensity to
      retain dirt. As the boy grows up he should be taught to keep
      his prepuce clean himself, just as he is taught to wash his
      ears. If such a procedure became customary the circumcision
      of children would become an uncommon operation. This would
      result in the saving of about 16 children's lives lost from
      circumcision each year in this country, besides saving much
      parental anxiety and an appreciable amount of the time of
      doctors and nurses.</p>

      <center>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
      </center>

      <p class="justify">The development of the prepuce is
      incomplete in the newborn male child, and separation from the
      glans, rendering it retractable, does not usually occur until
      some time between 9 months and 3 years. True phimosis is
      extremely rare in infancy.</p>

      <p class="text2">During the first year or two of life, when
      the infant is incontinent, the prepuce fulfils an essential
      function in protecting the glans. Its removal predisposes to
      meatal ulceration.</p>

      <p class="text2">The many and varied reasons commonly
      advanced for circumcising infants are critically examined.
      <span class="yellow">None are convincing.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Though early circumcision will prevent
      penile cancer, there is reason to suppose that keeping the
      prepuce clean would have a like effect in preventing this
      disease.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the light of these facts a conservative
      attitude towards the prepuce is proposed, and a routine for
      its hygiene is suggested. If adopted this would eliminate the
      vast majority of the tens of thousands of circumcision
      operations performed annually in this country, along with
      their yearly toll of some 16 child deaths.</p>
