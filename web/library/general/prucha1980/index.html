      <p class="text1">As happens from time to time, medical
      journal on both sides of the Atlantic are reviving the
      arguments against circumcision. But parents still lack any
      real knowledge when deciding whether their baby should be
      circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text2">There have always seemed to be as many
      medical reasons for circumcision as against it, and none of
      them has been especially strong or convincing. Those in
      favour may have been loosely influenced by a feeling that
      wise forefathers in the Judeo-Christian tradition had some
      important reason for this ritual, a reason presumably based
      on some notion of pioneering hygiene or sanitary measures.
      And possibly this illogical, atavistic belief has tilted the
      scale so that, certainly in my own practice and, I suspect,
      in most practices these days, an overwhelming majority of
      parents demand circumcision for their newborn boys.</p>

      <p><b>Barbaric custom</b></p>

      <p class="text2">While this procedure was a religious
      practice known in Egypt before being introduced to the
      Hebrews by Abraham, and is best known as prevailing among
      those of Jewish and Muslim faith, it has been practiced by
      peoples from every continent. As well, the rather brutal and
      barbaric custom of circumcision and clitoridectomy of baby
      girls is known in Islam and is extensively performed in
      certain African tribes and nations.</p>

      <p class="text2">When, according to the Old Testament,
      Jehovah promised to make Abraham&rsquo;s descendants His
      chosen people and to place them under His protection in the
      promised land of Canaan, there was a stipulation that His
      chosen people must be circumcised on the eighth day after
      birth or upon conversion to the faith, &ldquo;even the
      homeborn slave and the one bought from an outsider who is not
      of your seed&rdquo;.</p>

      <p class="text2">Then, in about 1200 BC, the God of Abraham
      commanded an exiled Egyptian prince, Moses, to return to
      Egypt and to lead the Jews to freedom. He gave the Israelites
      the Ten Commandments and the other Mosaic laws, imposing the
      same covenant with Moses that He had made with Abraham,
      including the same rite of circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the first century AD, the Roman
      philosopher Seneca was alarmed by the prevalence of Jewish
      customs and feared a loss of the Roman way of life. The
      actual conversions were numerous and would have been even
      greater but for the necessity of circumcision and the strict
      dietary laws.</p>

      <p class="text2">Then a Jew named Saul was cured of blindness
      by the laying on of hands of another Jew of the Ananias sect
      and was converted to Christianity. Later he changed his name
      to the Roman Paul and broke from the Apostolic church of
      Jerusalem, because of arguments regarding the procedure of
      converting pagans.</p>

      <p class="text2">Saint Paul felt that pagans should become
      Christians directly, without first converting to Judaism. He
      also stated that man should know God only through Christ
      &mdash; not, as the Jews believed, only through the word of
      God as revealed in the Torah (Old Tesament). He abandoned
      Jewish dietary laws and the rite of circumcision to make
      conversion easier.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision for religious purposes remains
      a rite &mdash; and a right &mdash; but otherwise the question
      of desirability of routine circumcision has to be answered on
      biologic and pathophysiologic grounds. And, if this is not
      decisive, then strictly on the basis of medical economics and
      priorities, since medicare at present covers routine
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">The only definite indication for
      circumcision (or simpler dorsal slit) is phimosis &mdash;
      congenital or acquired narrowing and constriction of the
      distal portion of the foreskin. With newborn, you can never
      be sure if circumcision is essential, since the future growth
      of the penis and prepuce usually provides adequate
      circumference of foreskin for easy retractability, and only a
      small handful of boys develop phimosis and have to be
      circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text2">Simple hygiene with soap and water should
      prevent accumulation of foreskin secretions (smegma) from
      which infection and ulceration can occur, and which can be
      factors in penile carcinoma, a rare disease.</p>

      <p class="text2">Should we routinely remove all appendices
      and tonsils because of the respective dangers of appendicitis
      or hypertrophy? I don&rsquo;t think so. Yet every GP or
      pediatrician will gladly perform circumcision.</p>

      <p><b>Is it worth it?</b></p>

      <p class="text2">I consider the advantages and disadvantages
      of routine circumcision rather marginal and the risks either
      of removal or preservation of the foreskin to be minimal. But
      many recent reports in medical journals stress that possible
      complications of this procedure (mutilation, hemorrhage,
      septicemia and neonatal sepsis) outweigh by far its possible
      advantages as a preventive procedure.</p>

      <p class="text2">While I don&rsquo;t remember having seen any
      of these complications in my 27 years of family practice, I
      probably did not associate some neonatal sepsis or severe,
      infected diaper rash with bacterial entry at the point of
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">The history of these few millimeters of skin
      is utterly epochal and fascinating. Yet since this procedure
      in Canada rests mostly in the hands of family practitioners,
      we should try to restrict this practice by advising parents,
      rather than letting them decide in arbitrary fashion. To do
      that, we need a full awareness of the seriousness of <a
      href="/library/complications/">complications</a> as pointed
      out by cases our pediatricians describe.</p>

      <p class="cirp">CIRP Note: There have been some changes since
      this paper was published in 1980, when medically-unnecessary
      non-therapeutic circumcision of infant boys still was a
      common practice in Canada and was covered by the various
      health insurance plans. Since that time, this operation has
      lost popularity, no longer is covered by any health insurance
      plan, and today, very few infant boys are circumcised in
      Canada. Dr. Prucha recommends circumcision to treat phimosis
      but this has been replaced by treatment with topical steriod
      ointment. Although Dr. Prucha considered circumcision to be a
      "right" in 1980, the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and
      Freedoms</i> (1982) and recent decisions of the Supreme Court
      of Canada pursuant to that <i>Charter</i> put that alleged
      "right" in jeopardy. Please see <a
      href="/library/legal/Canada/bouclin2005/"><i>An examination
      of legal and ethical issues surrounding male circumcision:
      the Canadian context</i></a> for more information about the
      legal status of male neonatal non-therapeutic circumcision in
      Canada.</p>
