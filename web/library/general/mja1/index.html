      MEASURE</font>
    </center>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p>S<font size="1">OME SUBJECTS DIE HARD</font>, and of all
      the hairy perennials, circumcision in infancy ranks high. The
      subject is all too often clouded by emotional reactions and
      obscured by entrenched attitudes. It has recently been
      revived in our correspondence columns by the publication in
      our issue of May 22, 1971 (<a
      href="/library/statements/apa1971/">page 1148</a>), of a
      resolution passed by the Australian P&aelig;diatric
      Association that :</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <font size="2">The Australian P&aelig;diatric Association
          recommends that newborn male infants should not, as a
          routine, be circumcised.</font>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Elsewhere in this issue (<a
      href="/library/statements/apa1971/">page 233</a>) we publish
      a further letter from the Australian P&aelig;diatric
      Association drawing attention to the <i>Australian
      P&aelig;diatric Journal</i> of June, 1970 in which the
      question is discussed in a <a
      href="/library/general/leitch1/">paper</a> by I. O. W.
      Leitch,<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></font>
      and in turn commented on by R. G. Birrell and E. Durham
      Smith. We should also like to draw attention to three other
      papers in T<font size="1">HE</font> M<font
      size="1">EDICAL</font> J<font size="1">OURNAL OF</font>
      A<font size="1">USTRALIA</font> of May 27, 1967, by <a
      href="/library/general/wright4/">J. E. Wright</a>, of
      Newcastle, by Mr. David St. John-Hunt, of London, and by <a
      href="/library/general/morgan2/">W. K. C. Morgan</a>, writing
      from the U.S.A. Though Mr. St. John-Hunt is not a medical
      man, his paper is of interest because he has a thorough
      knowledge of the extensive literature on the subject, has
      made a careful study of it, and approaches it in a
      commendably objective fashion.; the fact that he comes down
      in favour of circumcision is relatively unimportant, except
      that it demonstrates that the arguments for circumcision
      cannot be lightly brushed aside. Durham Smith also presents
      the question in a very objective fashion, and his views, as
      those of an experienced p&aelig;diatric surgeon, command
      respect.</p>

      <p>The resolution of the Australian P&aelig;diatric
      Association of course conforms with the weight of informed
      p&aelig;diatric opinion of British Medicine today&mdash;that
      routine p&aelig;diatric circumcision is founded partly on
      tradition and partly on a misunderstanding of normal anatomy,
      that it is hardly ever necessary in infancy and seldom in
      later life, and that as neonatal circumcision incurs an
      appreciable morbity and occasional mortality, its use as a
      routine measure cannot be justified. The arguments in favour
      of circumcision centre mainly round two points, (<i>a</i>)
      the embarrassment and inconvenience caused if circumcision
      becomes necessary in adult life, and (<i>b</i>) the question
      of hygiene. As regards the first, the p&aelig;diatrician
      might answer that the convenience of the few does not justify
      the indiscriminate cropping of the innocents. As regards the
      second, he might say that surgery is a poor substitute for
      good hygiene. The old argument that lack of circumcision was
      a handicap in desert warfare is, we trust, scarcely relevant
      to modern urban civilization. Of more substance is the
      association between cancer of the penis and cervical cancer
      with the uncircumcised state. In both these cases there is
      evidence that careful washing is just as effective as surgery
      as a prophylactic measure.</p>

      <p>However, this may be over-simplifying things a bit. We can
      perhaps let Durham Smith have the last word:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <font size="2">Most of the criticisms of circumcision are
          really criticism of <i>bad</i> circumcision, done at the
          <i>wrong</i> time.</font>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>He goes on to condemn neonatal circumcision on the grounds
      that the circumstances are too often conductive to bad
      surgery. He believes that doctors should encourage people to
      regard the uncircumcised state as normal, but that parental
      wishes should be respected, as there is a case to be made out
      for circumcision as a hygiene measure. However, in such cases
      he considers the elective procedure is best performed in the
      second or third year of life, but he insists that this should
      be done with the patient in the hands of a competent
      an&aelig;sthetist and with strict observation of good
      technique which should reduce complications to neglible
      proportions.</p>

      <p>This middle of the road view will certainly be assailed by
      extremists in both camps, which only goes to show that the
      question of "routine" circumcision (in fact, as a hygiene
      measure) is an issue which is still very far from
      settled.</p>

      <p><a id="n1" name="n1"></a><font size="2"><sup>1</sup>We
      would take issue with Leitch over his opening statement,
      "Circumcision is a measure which originated in ancient
      Egypt", which he wrongly attributes to R. P. Bolande. Bolande
      actually wrote: "The ubiquity of circumcision coupled with
      the isolation of many of its primitive practitioners
      indicated multifocal independent origins at the dawn of
      civilization" (<i>New Engl. J. Med.</i> 1969; 280:
      502).</font></p>
