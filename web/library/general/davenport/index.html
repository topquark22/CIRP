<P>The foreskin envelops the glans from the fifth month of gestation. It
begins dorsally and ends by fusing ventrally to cover the newly
formed urethra. Actual fusion between the two epithelial layers of
glans and foreskin is apparent at birth and has been termed
physiological phimosis. This non-retractility remains in most boys
for at least the first two years of life until natural separation
ensues.

<P>Two conditions that are related to the process of preputial
separation may give cause for concern. Firstly, the process may be
uneven, with adhesions between glans and prepuce persisting even up
to adolescence. Secondly, the desquamation of epithelial cells
between the glans and non-retractile foreskin leads to accumulation
of "pearls' of a white smegma-like substance. Both conditions are
usually without actual symptoms and, as they are usually harmless,
should not precipitate undue intervention.

<P>History of circumcision

Circumcision is one of the earliest operations, being recorded by the
ancient Egyptians and other peoples of the Near East. Neonatal
circumcision on the eighth day of life is a tenet of the Jewish faith
and is performed by a mohel, often a vocation which is passed from
father to son. In order to emulate the prophet Mohammed, Muslims also
perform circumcision, and, though the timing is less strict, it is
usually done well before puberty.

<P>The fashion of routine neonatal circumcision, other than for overtly
religious reasons, has varied over the years. After the second world
war almost 95% of male infants born in the United States were
circumcised (usually by obstetricians) for reasons of "hygiene." This
practice has declined, and in 1971 the <A HREF="/library/statements/aap/#1971">American Academy of
Paediatrics</A> stated: "There are no valid medical indications for
routine circumcision in the neonatal period." Yet even today, there
is still debate in the medical literature on the possible benefits of
routine circumcision - though this is perhaps carried out with rather
more heat than light. The arguments for the routine use of any
operation, however simple, have to be outstandingly convincing as any
surgical procedure has its attendant risks and complications.
Certainly, circumcision has a <A HREF="/library/complications/">long list of possible complications</A>,
the commonest being infection and bleeding.

<P>It has been stated that circumcision is still performed too often in
Britain, where routine circumcision has never been prevalent. For
instance, of a group of 420 boys referred to paediatric surgical unit
in Liverpool with a diagnosis of phimosis requiring circumcision,
over half had a non-retractile foreskin appropriate to their age and
required only reassurance.
