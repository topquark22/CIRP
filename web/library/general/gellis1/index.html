      <font size="7">Circumcision</font> 

      <p><font size="6">O</font>pponents of routine circumcision of
      the male infant will greet with pleasure the appearance of
      the article by <a
      href="/library/complications/annunziato1/">Annunziato and
      Goldblum</a> (p 1187) and the one by <a
      href="/library/complications/sussman1/">Sussman et al</a> (p
      1189) on unusual complications of the operation. Those who
      favor routine circumcision will be quick to point out that
      Fournier's syndrome and the scalded skin syndrome are very
      rare complications that should not deter parents from
      requesting circumcision for the newborn boy.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Circumcision of the
      newborn continues for the following reasons: it may be
      routine because of religious beliefs, and parents and
      physicians have for years accepted the procedure on the basis
      that arguments that the circumcised male is at less risk of
      having cancer develop, and that a malignant neoplasm in the
      genital tract of women married to circumcised men is less
      frequent than in women married to uncircumcised men. <span
      class="yellow">It is an uncontestable fact at this point that
      there are more deaths from complications of circumcision than
      from cancer of the penis.</span></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is unlikely that a
      listing of the hazards of circumcision will deter parents who
      insist on circumcision of their infant for religious reasons.
      However, for all other parents, <span
      class="yellow">physicians should become more vociferous than
      they have been in discouraging circumcision of the
      newborn.</span> They have been slow to do so because they
      have not been convinced that circumcision is of little
      benefit. Yet, today, especially, <span class="yellow">the
      circumcised infant is at greater risk than ever before. He is
      clustered in large newborn nurseries (because small units are
      too costly) and is therefore exposed to even greater numbers
      of organisms that have been altered by their own exposure to
      multiple antibiotics. He has enough portals of entry as it
      is&mdash;his nose, mouth, conjunctivas, and the end of his
      umbilicus. It seems totally unnecessary to aid and abet
      lurking bacteria by adding a raw wound to his
      genitalia.</span></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I should
      like to cast my vote against the use of the term Fournier's
      syndrome and beg that the condition be referred to as
      gangrene of penis, scrotum, or perineum. There are already
      far too many syndromes. The reader in two weeks or even less
      will be hard put to recall the meaning of the name, but he is
      unlikely to be confused by the term gangrene. Down, I say,
      with both circumcision and Fournier's syndrome.</p>
