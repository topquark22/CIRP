      <h2>Spence On Circumcision</h2>

      <p>A C<font size="1">ORRESPONDENT</font> sends up a copy of a
      letter written in 1950 to a local doctor by the late Sir
      James Spence of Newcastle upon Tyne:</p>

      <p>My Dear C.,</p>

      <p>Your patient C.D., &aelig;tat 7 months, has the prepuce
      with which he was born. You ask me, with a note of persuasion
      in your question, if it should be excised. am I to make this
      decision on scientific grounds, or am I to acquiesce in a
      ritual which took its origin at the behest of that
      arch-sanitarian, Moses?</p>

      <p>If you can show good reason why a ritual designed to ease
      the penalties of concupiscence amidst the sand and flies of
      the Syrian deserts should be continued in this England of
      clean bed-linen and lesser opportunity, I shall listen to
      your argument; but if you base your argument on anatomical
      faults, then I must refute it. The anatomists have never
      studied the form and evolution of the preputial orifice. They
      do not understand that Nature does not intend it to be
      stretched and retracted in the Temples of the Welfare Centres
      or ritually removed in the precincts of the operating
      theatres. Retract the prepuce, and you see a pin point
      opening, but draw it forward and you see a channel wide
      enough for all the purposes for which the infant needs the
      organ at that early age.</p>

      <p>What looks like a pin point opening at 7 months will
      become a wide channel of communication at 17.</p>

      <p>Nature is a possessive mistress, and whatever mistakes she
      makes about the structure of the less essential organs such
      as the brain and stomach, in which she is not much
      interested, you can be sure that she knows best about the
      genital organs...</p>
