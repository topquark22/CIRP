      <p class="fate">Fate of the Foreskin</p>

      <p class="text2">S<span class="sc1">IR</span>,&mdash;I am
      grateful to the many correspondents who have commented on my
      <a href="/library/general/gairdner/">article</a> (December
      24, 1949, p. 1433), particularly to those who have added
      further facts to a subject the discussion of which in the
      past has too often engendered heat rather than light. A
      number of pertinent questions have been asked.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Phimosis.</i> Dr. C. A. Royde (January
      21, p. 181) doubts my contention that true phimosis causing
      urinary obstruction virtually never occurs and so cannot be
      responsible for many of the child deaths registered as due to
      &ldquo;circumcision or phimosis.&rdquo; The facts are : (1) I
      have long searched for such a case without finding one ; (2)
      two experienced paediatric surgeons, Mr. Twistington Higgins
      and Mr. Dennis Browne, both interested in urology, inform me
      that they have never met such a case ; and (3) the only
      reference I know is that of Campbell,<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> who writes, &ldquo;I know of four
      infant deaths in New York City from this cause,&rdquo;
      without giving further details-but this author&rsquo;s
      account of the anatomy of the prepuce is so at variance with
      my own that I feel bound to question his explanation of these
      deaths.</p>

      <p class="text2">Drs. H. M. Rose and A. M. Gould (January 28,
      p. 247) find &ldquo; true phimosis &rdquo; present in
      one-sixth of the infants referred for circumcision.. I am
      well aware of the appearances they describe, and if they will
      try the effect of simply completing the separation of the
      prepuce from the glans they will be surprised to see that the
      preputial constriction is an illusion. In this context, Dr.
      B. Webber&rsquo;s experience (January 28, p. 247 is valuable
      : in circumcising some 200 infants he found none in which the
      prepuce was not easily retractable after separation.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Venereal disease.</i> Limitation of space
      caused me to deal summarily with the evidence, bt my
      conclusion that it &ldquo; seems scarcely to warrant
      universal circumcision as a prophylactic against venereal
      disease &rdquo; was based on a critical reading of the
      literature, including most of the authors listed by Dr. C. A.
      Royde when he affirms that it has been well established that
      circumcision reduces the risk of syphilis. In fact the
      existing evidence bearing on this matter proves
      disappointingly poor. For instance Wolbarst&rsquo;s<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> figures, which are much quoted, do not
      distinguish between chancre and chancroid ; as chancroid is
      the one venereal disease which all agree is uncommon in the
      circumcised his figures fail to prove that syphilis is less
      common in the circumcised. Comparable deficiencies vitiate
      the value of the statistical evidence of other older
      authorities, as Lloyd and Lloyd<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      showed in their review of the subject in 1934. Since then
      little further matter has been published except for a study
      by Wilson<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> of venereal disease
      as seen in the Canadian army. His results are difficult to
      assess because although both chancre and chancroid were shown
      to be much less common in the circumcised, so also was
      gonorrhoea, although there has been general agreement that
      gonorrhoea is in no way prevented by circumcision. The only
      careful study of the value of circumcision in preventing
      syphilis remains that of Lloyd and Lloyd, whose results from
      Guy&rsquo;s Hospital V.D. department showed that the
      proportion of circumcised men was 22% (of 118) with genital
      syphilis, compared with 27% (of 278) with gonorrhoea-i.e.,
      there was no great difference which would favour the idea
      that circumcision prevented syphilis. A fair summary of the
      evidence would be that circumcision does not prevent
      gonorrhoea, greatly reduces the chance of chancroid, and
      possibly may have some small effect in reducing the risk of
      syphilis, though this is unproved.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Penile cancer.</i> Dr. J. B. Peck
      (January 14, p. 122), among others, considers as this disease
      can be prevented by circumcision it should be, since even (as
      I think likely) rational local hygiene were equally effective
      a number of men will never maintain the requisite level of
      hygiene. A corollary of this view is that all males should be
      circumcised in infancy, and that if this is done in the first
      month, the risk of an anaesthetic can be avoided. Deaths per
      year from &ldquo; circumcision or phimosis &rdquo; in England
      and Wales between 1940 and 1947 have averaged 3 in the first
      month of life and 12 in the first year, and it seems certain
      that if all the 400,000 males born each year in this country
      were circumcised a certain number of disasters must
      inevitably occur from infection, if not from the horrible
      surgical bloomers listed by Mr. Denis Browne. The question
      comes down to this: Is it justifiable to sacrifice a few
      infants in order to save a probable larger number of elderly
      and (as I have shown) low-grade men from cancer ? Some may
      consider it is.</p>

      <p class="text2">&ldquo; <i>The supposed aesthetic or erotic
      superiority of the shorn member.</i> &rdquo; Dr. Dermod
      MacCarthy (February 4, p. 304) elegantly shown us that
      Michelangelo would have voted conservative on the first of
      these issues, while Dr. R. C. MacKeith (January 14, p. 122)
      strikes a blow for unsatisfied English womanhood and asks for
      more information about the second. To the evidence, sketchy
      and circumstantial, I have already adduced only this can be
      added : outside the English-speaking people of the West
      circumcision is not customary, and Frenchmen, Swedes, and
      South Americans, to name three different races who are said
      to take these matters quite seriously, seem to have felt no
      need to employ circumcision to further their ends.</p>

      <p class="text2">Finally, I believe that this controversial
      issue can be simplified to a choice between two possible
      views, either of which accords with the facts. Some may hold
      that <i>all</i> male infants should be circumcised,
      irrespective of the state of the prepuce, in order possibly
      to prevent certain late stage disease-paraphimosis, cancer,
      and venereal disease. The operation should then probably be
      done in the first month, and in the full knowledge that an
      occasional accident may cause the loss of an infant&rsquo;s
      life. This is rational prophylaxis. Others will reserve
      circumcision for the occasional case where disease of the
      prepuce requires this treatment, having in mind that the
      prepuce cannot be retracted during the first few years. This
      is rational therapeutics.</p>

      <p class="text2">There is a third policy-that which largely
      obtains to-day-whereby a proportion of infants, varying from
      12 to 84% in different sections of the community, are almost
      invariably selected for circumcision on the grounds of
      supposed phimosis. The burden of my argument has been to show
      that this practice fails utterly to accord with anatomical
      facts. I still have hopes that Mr. Geoffrey Parker&rsquo;s
      (January 21, p. 181) sorrowful comment on my <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">article</a>&mdash;&ldquo;
      that no one will take the slightest notice of what he says
      &ldquo;&mdash;may prove an overstatement.&mdash;I am,
      etc.,</p>
