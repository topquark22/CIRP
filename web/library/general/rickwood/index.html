      <h1>The unkindest cut of all?</h1>

      <p>Boys are circumcised for three reasons. The first - and,
      for all but the most recent sliver of history, the only
      reason - is as an item of religious practice or,
      occasionally, as a rite of passage. The origin of the custom
      is ancient and obscure but is often traceable to peoples
      inhabiting hot, sandy, regions. A colleague who had served in
      the VIIIth (Desert) Army averred, without elaboration, that
      circumcision had advantages in such conditions. Ritual
      circumcision impinges upon ordinary practice only by its
      complications (secondary haemorrhage, circumcision of
      hypospadias) and which usually follow procedures privately
      performed by practitioners of arguable competence. Where
      medical care is free at delivery it has been proposed that
      extending this facility to religious circumcision would
      obviate its complications; in the spirit of the times this
      issue seems destined to be determined by the moral precepts
      of chartered accountancy rather than by humanitarian
      concerns.</p>

      <p>The second reason for circumcision, also usually
      undertaken neonatally and without anaesthetic, has been
      termed `social', or a `routine' and is intended as a
      prophylactic measure, or talisman, against future ailments.
      This practice, almost exclusive to the (white)
      English-speaking Diaspora,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> took
      root around the turn of the century. The ostensible benefits
      claimed were splendidly diverse (protection against gout,
      hernia, asthma, epilepsy etc.),<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      although the underlying theme most likely lay in its supposed
      discouragement of masturbation,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
      a habit peculiarly abhorrent to the `muscular Christianity'
      then triumphant in English cultures and plausibly explaining
      the geographical distribution of the practice.</p>

      <p>In the British Isles `routine' circumcision, fashionable
      mainly within society's upper crust,<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> declined to negligible proportions
      after the war and a similar trend occurred within nations of
      the white Commonwealth.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> In the
      United States, by contrast, the practice increased during
      this same period and, by the mid-seventies, upwards of 80% of
      boys were circumcised neonatally.</p>

      <p>The benefits claimed by its proponents had become
      sophisticated to the point of plausibility principally that
      it offered protection against preputial ailments, most forms
      of venereal disease, carcinoma of the penis and carcinoma of
      the cervix in some prospective spouse. When examined,<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,4</a></sup> those relating to venereal disease
      and cervical carcinoma lacked substance, Although penile
      cancer is reputedly exceptional in the uncircumcised, the
      incidence and mortality of this complaint in the United
      States differ little, if, at all, from those in nations where
      circumcision is rare.<sup><a href="#n1">1,4</a></sup> A
      properly executed circumcision is certain proof against
      phimosis and paraphimosis but not against other penile
      problems of childhood, notably balanitis which reportedly
      occurs in 3-8% of circumcised boys.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5,6</a></sup></p>

      <p>In 1975 the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap/#a1975">American Academy of
      Pediatrics</a> concluded that there was `no absolute medical
      indication for circumcision of the newborn.'<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> The impact upon the American public of
      this delphic pronouncement, plus the more colourful advocacy
      of lay groups such as INTACT (International Organisation
      Against Circumcision Trauma), seems to have been muted, in
      that 10 years on, the incidence of routine circumcision had
      declined by less than 2%.</p>

      <p>Latterly two further putative benefits of circumcision
      have entered the lists and have occasioned a voile face by
      the <a href="/library/statements/aap/#a1989">American Academy
      of Pediatrics</a>.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> Some
      retrospective epidemiological studies have indicated that the
      uncircumcised are more susceptible to heterosexual
      transmission of HIV infection.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9,10</a></sup> On current evidence, any protective
      effect of circumcision seems no more than slight<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> and those seeking to avoid AIDS would
      be advised to pursue other more effective means to that
      end.</p>

      <p>A more persuasive case exists regarding urinary infections
      during infancy. In studies of children of American military
      personnel, Wiswell and associates<sup><a
      href="#n11">11,12</a></sup> presented evidence that during
      the first year of life the incidence of urinary infection in
      the uncircumcised, 1-2%, exceeded that in the circumcised by
      ten to twenty fold and, moreover, that the incidence of
      urinary infections had risen pari passu with a declining rate
      of neonatal circumcision.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>
      Herzog<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> found urinary
      infections only in uncircumcised male infants and among these
      some 25% had urinary anomalies, principally minor
      vesicouteric reflux but also some obstructive uropathies.
      These and similar studies<sup><a href="#n15">15,16</a></sup>
      have justly attracted critical comment,<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> especially for their uniformly
      retrospective nature, but the trend of their observations is
      sufficiently consistent to indicate that neonatal
      circumcision does indeed afford a measure of protection
      against infantile urinary infection. Should this influence
      European practice? One view, bearing in mind the expense a
      change in policy would entail, is that for every 100
      procedures just one or two individuals would stand to benefit
      and then arguably since urinary infection may draw attention
      to some anomaly notably posterior urethral valves, where
      early detection is advantageous. An exception might exist in
      boys at risk from known anomalies, especially those with
      vesicoureteric reflux detected by prenatal ultrasonography in
      which urinary tract infections are common.<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> A controlled trial of neonatal
      circumcision in such specific circumstances would be
      worthwhile.</p>

      <p>The third reason for circumcision is for immediate medical
      indications. Currently the National Health Service in England
      and Wales funds around 31,000 operative circumcisions
      annually of which all but a small fraction are for medical
      reasons. Should such wholesale surgical endeavour, at
      appreciable public expense, be a matter for congratulation or
      concern? Some two thirds of procedures are upon boys and
      among these 87% are indicated for `phimosis'.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> Any suspicion that numbers are
      excessive must, therefore, lie in over-diagnosis of
      'phimosis' in boys. This hypothesis begins - and ends - with
      definition. From its derivation (muzzling) phimosis could be,
      and often is, diagnosed whenever the prepuce is wholly or
      partly nonretractable.</p>

      <p>A different perspective comes from considering the
      developmental history of this organ. During fetal life, as
      the foreskin grows forwards over the glans, no plane of
      separation exists between these structures. Thus preputial
      `adhesions' are normal, not pathological. Spontaneous
      separation commences distally around the time of birth and
      proceeds proximally at a rate varying widely from one
      individual to another. Until separation is well established,
      the preputial orifice, while relatively narrow, is supple and
      unscarred, a state sometimes termed `physiological phimosis'.
      At this stage, the prepuce tends to `balloon' during
      micturition although this is seldom noticed prior to toilet
      training. This phenomenon rarely betokens urinary obstruction
      and ceases as the prepuce becomes more retractable. The
      natural history of preputial development has been classically
      described by <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> and subsequently amplified by <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">&Oslash;ster</a><sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup> in a study of almost 2,000 boys
      serially examined from school entry to physical maturity. At
      5 years of age, some 10% still had a wholly non-retractable
      foreskin and upwards of 50% preputial adhesions. By 17 years
      of age, without any intervention, the foreskin had become
      fully and easily retractable in all boys excepting 1% who had
      developed true phimosis.</p>

      <p>What is true phimosis? In a small number of boys (and some
      adults) the tip of the prepuce becomes white, scarred arid
      indurated, appearances which are unmistakeable and clearly
      pathological. The histological changes are of Balanitis
      Xerotica Obliterans<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup> and the
      cause is unknown. The condition mainly affects the
      prepubertal but is exceptional before 5 years of age. It is
      the only absolute indication for circumcision. In a survey of
      practice in the Mersey Region of England almost half the
      circumcisions for `phimosis' were in boys under five years of
      age and the age distribution curve of procedures for this
      indication exactly paralleled that for developmental
      nonretractile foreskin in boys referred to a specialised
      unit,<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> both findings
      indicating that `phimosis' is indeed appreciably
      over-diagnosed. Balanoposthitis accounts for some 10% of
      medical circumcisions. The incidence of this complaint among
      uncircumcised boys is reportedly as high as 14%. Here, again,
      definition intrudes as many so labelled complain only of mild
      irritation and soreness of the prepuce.</p>

      <p>The pathognomonic feature of true balanoposthitis is
      purulent discharge from the preputial orifice and in a series
      where this criterion applied the incidence was just 3% of
      which only one-third suffered recurrent episodes.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> Here, indications for circumcision
      are relative and debatable. Some consider circumcision
      advisable for boys suffering recurrent, troublesome,
      episodes<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> while others believe
      that lysis of preputial adhesions to allow full retractabilty
      of the prepuce is sufficient treatment.<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup> EMLA cream may be employed as a
      local anaesthetic for this purpose.<sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup></p>

      <p>Other indications for circumcision are few, if any. The
      ever-popular `pinhole' meatus occurs in reality only in a few
      boys with pathological phimosis and deserves consignment to
      the diagnostic dustbin. Likewise the 'redundant' foreskin, a
      non-existing entity except when constituting a
      self-fulfilling prophecy at the hands of some practitioners.
      Paraphimosis accounts for less than 1 in 8,000 paediatric
      surgical admissions<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> and results
      from abuse, not disease, of the foreskin. If treated by
      reduction only rather than by circumcision, recurrence is
      exceptional.</p>

      <p>How many boys really need medical circumcision? Generously
      1% for true phimosis<sup><a href="#n19">19,20</a></sup> and,
      perhaps, similarly for recurrent balanoposthitis.<sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup> Yet, cumulatively some 6% of boys in
      England and Wales have undergone medical circumcision by
      their fifteenth birthday<sup><a href="#n20">20</a></sup>
      indicating that two thirds of current procedures are
      unnecessary - not a matter for congratulation. Perhaps
      affairs are more admirably conducted in the Irish Republic;
      the author would be agreeably surprised to learn of this.</p>
