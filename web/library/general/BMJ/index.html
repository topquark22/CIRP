    <h2 align="center">THE CASE AGAINST NEONATAL CIRCUMCISION</h2>

    <p align="center"><b>[An unsigned editorial.]</b></p>

    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="justify">Part of the North American way of life
        is removal of the foreskin within a few hours of birth.
        Nearly two million boys are born each year in the United
        States and in some centres 80%-90% are circumcised,<sup><a
        href="#n1">1</a></sup> using vast amounts of medical and
        nursing time and costing parents equally vast amounts of
        money. In Scandinavia, on the other hand. routine
        circumcision is almost unknown,<sup><a
        href="#n2">2</a></sup> and in Britain it is becoming
        unusual. In the 1930s about one-third of British boys were
        circumcised,<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> but by 1949 the
        proportion had fallen to one-fifth,<sup><a
        href="#n4">4</a></sup> and by 1963 only 10% of schoolboys
        in Rochdale had been circumcised.<sup><a
        href="#n5">5</a></sup> In hospitals in England and Wales in
        1975 the rate was about 6%<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup>;
        this represents some 20 000 circumcisions a year. The
        mortality is negligible.</p>

        <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Practice in Britain may have been affected by <a
        href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner's important
        paper</a>,<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> published in the
        <i>BMJ</i> in 1949. He showed that while 90% of boys have
        an unretractable foreskin at birth by the age of 3 the
        proportion has dropped to only 10%. Other studies have
        confirmed this natural development. In over 9000 schoolboys
        examined in <a
        href="/library/general/oster/">Denmark</a><sup><a
        href="#n7">7</a></sup> phimosis was found in 8% of
        5-year-olds but in only 1% of secondary pupils. Among 152
        teenage English boys only one had a non-retractable
        foreskin, although full retraction was prevented by an
        adherent prepuce in 22.</p>

        <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Most circumcisions performed on the newborn are therefore
        unnecessary - in the sense that in time nearly all boys
        become able to retract their foreskin and wash underneath
        it. The North American arguments in favour of mass
        circumcision are that many uncircumcised men do not perform
        this toilet, that they run a risk of developing carcinoma
        of the penis, and that their wives may run an increased
        risk of developing carcinoma of the cervix. These last two
        arguments could be weighty ones, but some careful
        studies<sup><a href="#n8">8,9</a></sup> have failed to show
        any difference in the incidence of cervical carcinoma in
        the wives of circumcised and uncircumcised husbands.
        Circumcision in infancy does virtually prevent penile
        carcinoma - there are only six recorded examples of this
        neoplasm in circumcised Jews.<sup><a
        href="#n10">10</a></sup> Even in the uncircumcised, however
        penile carcinoma is rare. In Sweden, which has a male
        population of 3.7 million (few of whom are circumcised),
        there are but 15 deaths from carcinoma of the penis in a
        year.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Some 5600 men die each
        week in England and Wales but only two of these deaths are
        due to penille carcinoma - only 0.14% of all deaths for
        malignant disease in men.<sup><a
        href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p class="justify"><font color="navy"><b>[CIRP note:
          Modern research has established the role of the human
          papilloma virus and smoking in the etiology of carcinoma
          of the penis and of the cervix. The foreskin has been
          cleared of blame.]</b></font></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Surgeons who work in areas where ritual circumcision is not
        available are sometimes asked to don rabbinical robes on
        the eight day to circumcise a Jewish baby, and they may
        have been impressed by the lack of distress as the baby
        sucks on a teat containing some brandy. There is however a
        big difference between these rites and routine circumcision
        of newborn boys. Too often this is seen as an uninteresting
        chore to be passed to inadequately trained junior staff,
        which evidently is not without risk. There are many reports
        of removal of most of the skin of the penile shaft,
        injuries to the glans, circumcision of hypospadiacs, and
        the need to perform a second circumcision on as many as 10%
        of babies because inadequate removal of mucosa has been
        followed by secondary phimosis.<sup><a
        href="#n1">1,12</a></sup> The present day hospital nursery,
        often colonised by antibiotic-resistant organisms, is a
        dangerous place for a newborn baby with a raw penile wound
        - as is shown by two recent papers.<sup><a
        href="#n13">13,14</a></sup> These record three babies who
        developed <a
        href="/library/complications/annunziato1/">staphylococcal
        septicaemia (one fatal)</a> and one with spreading <a
        href="/library/complications/sussman1/">septic gangrene of
        the scrotal skin</a> after circumcision in the first week
        of life. Haematogenous osteomyelitis and lung abscess have
        also been reported as complications. Furthermore, all
        babies who lose their foreskin lose the natural protection
        of the glans penis, which prevents it being burnt by
        ammoniacal urine on the wet nappy. Meatal ulceration is a
        painful condition and meatal stenosis a serious one.</p>

        <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Presumably most Americans are satisfied with their present
        practice, and some justify it most forcefully.<sup><a
        href="#n15"></a></sup> Others, however do have
        misgivings,<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> in so far as
        there is really no rational case for general neonatal
        circumcision. On the other hand, surgeons and urologists
        know that many men conceal a dirty mess beneath the
        foreskin and that in some the discomforts of phimosis make
        circumcision necessary, and that this is an embarassing and
        uncomfortable procedure in adult life. These problems can
        be forestalled. Examination of the penis, as well as the
        testes should be a standard part of school medical
        inspections. This would allow the few boys with true
        phimosis to be treated early, and at secondary school would
        provide an excellent opportunity to back up or amplify
        parental instruction in personal hygiene.</p>

        <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Many surgeons who are not willing to perform circumcision
        much before three years of age accept that after that age
        operation is justified for phimosis and recurrent
        balanitis. The parents' wishes, both for and against the
        operation, must be taken into account; but the operation
        between 3 and 5 is probably the best compromise since it
        avoids the discomforts of circumcision later in life.
        Unfortunately only one-third of the operations in England
        and Wales are before 5 years.<sup><a
        href="#n6">6</a></sup>. Nevertheless the circumcision rate
        of about 6% is probably the correct proportion in a Western
        country today.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p class="justify"><font color="navy"><b>[CIRP note: This
          editorial expresses the view that about 6% of men need
          circumcisions. The BMJ, in a <a
          href="/library/general/gordon/">later editorial</a>
          published on 2 January 1993, expressed the view that
          "overall between 1% and 2% of boys need circumcision for
          medical indications. Since this was before the
          development of <a href="/library/treatment/">alternative
          effective conservative treatments</a> for phimosis and
          balanitis, presumably the editors of BMJ would put the
          rate much lower today, perhaps 0.1% to 0.2% or 1 or 2 per
          1000 boys. This would make the arguments expressed in
          this paper apply with even greater force.]</b></font></p>
