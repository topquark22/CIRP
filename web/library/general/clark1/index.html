      <h2>Managing the paediatric foreskin</h2>

      <p><b>Abstract</b></p>

      <p>Phimosis is Greek for 'muzzling'. It is the inability to
      retract the foreskin due to a narrow preputial ring. A
      pathological phimosis may be caused by recurrent infection of
      the foreskin causing scarring and narrowing of the preputial
      ring. Such narrowing is not to be confused with the
      physiological asymptomatic nonretractile foreskin, which
      requires no treatment. 'Ballooning' of the foreskin (urine
      collecting under the foreskin during micturition) is often
      attributed to a phimotic foreskin.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: CIRP cannot provide the six
      figures published with this article at this time.]</p>

      <p>Since ancient times the foreskin has been the nub of
      heated medical and ethical debates.<a href="#n1">1</a>
      Historically, circumcision was done primarily for religious
      reasons, until the 1890s when an orthopaedic specialist
      called JHC Simes popularised the operation on medical
      grounds: 'The operation of circumcision is one which is
      demanded for hygienic purposes; one which is frequently
      necessary for pathological conditions; and finally, one which
      is of unquestionable prophylactic importance.'<a
      href="#n1">1</a></p>

      <p>Many myths concerning the benefits of circumcision persist
      in the Western world. Circumcision used to be thought to
      reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in partners, but this
      view is now discredited. With some theoretical justification,
      circumcision has been proposed to decrease HIV
      transmissibility. However, the mucosal tissue of the
      prostate, urethra and seminal vesicles secrete a substance
      rich in lytic material that lubricates the mucosal surface of
      the glans and foreskin, thus forming a protective barrier
      against STDs, and the foreskin itself may in fact be a
      protective factor in STD transmission. Rather than
      circumcision, emphasis should be on education concerning
      responsible and safe sex.</p>

      <p>Thankfully, the circumcision rate is declining in the UK.
      This is due to more widespread understanding of the nature of
      foreskin development and retractability, and alternative
      treatments including topical steroid cream, adhesiolysis and
      foreskin-conserving surgery (preputioplasty).</p>

      <p>However, the foreskin remains a source of considerable
      concern for boys and parents alike.</p>

      <p>In a recent study<a href="#n2">2</a> we assessed 100
      consecutive 'problem foreskin' referrals to the paediatric
      surgical service in South-East Scotland, and followed all
      patients to discharge.</p>

      <p>A large proportion (71 per cent) did not require surgical
      intervention, and 29 per cent had a physiologically normal
      foreskin for their age and were discharged at their initial
      visit.</p>

      <p>Conversely, there were six cases of balanitis xerotica
      obliterans (BXO) - a serious foreskin pathology mandating
      circumcision - and none of these were documented in the
      referral.<a href="#n2">2</a></p>

      <p>The purpose of this article is to outline the natural
      development of retractability, relevant pathologies,
      variations of normality, and treatment pathways for common
      foreskin problems.</p>

      <p>* The natural history of the foreskin In the fetus the
      inner surface of the prepuce and glans receive a common
      epithelium, which separates around the time of birth. This
      separation results from cellular keratinisation under the
      influence of androgen.</p>

      <p>Gairdner<a href="#n3">3</a> found that foreskin
      retractability increased with age; on average foreskins were
      50 per cent retractable by the end of the first year, 75 per
      cent by the end of two years, and 90 per cent by the end of
      three years. Oster<a href="#n4">4</a> found the prevalence of
      non- retractable foreskins between the ages of six and 17
      years decreased from eight to one per cent without surgical
      intervention. The unretractable, non-problematic foreskin
      should therefore be considered normal up to the age of 17.
      <span class="crl">[CIRP Note: The authors here blindly have
      quoted outmoded data on development of preputial
      retractability in boys. They of all people should know
      better. For better information see: <a
      href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/info/retraction.html"
       target="_blank">The Development of Retractile Foreskin in
      the Child and Adolescent</a>.]</span></p>

      <p>Figure 1 shows a normal pouting, non-retractile
      foreskin.</p>

      <p>* Religious circumcision Circumcision for reasons of
      religious observance remains common. In the UK there is
      marked inter-regional variation in NHS funding for
      circumcision on cultural or religious grounds.</p>

      <p>Our policy is to perform such circumcisions in the NHS,
      believing this to be preferable to unregulated surgery in
      less-than-ideal environments, which may lead to potentially
      disastrous complications. However, funding for such
      non-essential surgery is frequently questioned in the modern
      NHS.</p>

      <p>Foreskin conditions</p>

      <p>* Phimosis is Greek for 'muzzling'. It is the inability to
      retract the foreskin due to a narrow preputial ring (see
      figure 2).</p>

      <p>A pathological phimosis may be caused by recurrent
      infection of the foreskin causing scarring and narrowing of
      the preputial ring. Such narrowing is not to be confused with
      the physiological asymptomatic non-retractile foreskin, as
      shown in figure 1, which requires no treatment.</p>

      <p>'Ballooning' of the foreskin (urine collecting under the
      foreskin during micturition) is often attributed to a
      phimotic foreskin. If the patient does not have repeated
      episodes of infection, then ballooning is considered a
      variant of normal.</p>

      <p>* Treatment We do not recommend treatment for the
      prepubertal boy with a 'physiological' non-retractile
      foreskin that is asymptomatic. However, in boys with
      conditions such as recurrent posthitis or balanitis the
      primary treatment is a topical steroid cream: 1.0 per cent
      hydrocortisone cream or 0.1 per cent betamethasone cream
      topically to the foreskin, 3-4 times daily for an 12-week
      period is effective in 80 per cent of cases.</p>

      <p>The non-retractability can recur with cessation of the
      cream, but the problem usually resolves permanently with a
      second course. The steroid appears to work by thinning the
      skin of the phimotic area and increasing its elasticity.<a
      href="#n5">5</a></p>

      <p>* Balanitis and balanoposthitis describe inflammation of
      the glans and prepuce respectively. Usually these terms are
      reserved for inflammation due to infection, but foreskin
      inflammation can occur due to other conditions, such as
      ammonia dermatitis, foreskin fiddling, and a combination of
      smegma and congenital adhesions.</p>

      <p>Balanoposthitis presents with an acutely inflamed and
      painful glans that is discharging pus. Treatment consists of
      gentle washing in warm water and either topical or oral
      antibiotics. Recurrent balanitis is not an absolute
      indication for circumcision. Figure 3 shows an acute
      balanitis.</p>

      <p>* Adhesions Some authors suggest that adhesions may
      develop between the glans and the prepuce due to
      balanoposthitis. These are said to be distinct from the
      congenital adhesions due to delayed desquamation of the
      epithelial cells.</p>

      <p>We feel that the majority of adhesions are congenital and
      there is little evidence to support acquired adhesions.
      Treatment is only indicated if the patient is symptomatic;
      for example, there may be recurrent balanoposthitis, or an
      asymmetric stream. Adhesiolysis can be performed by foreskin
      retraction under local anaesthetic cream, or under a general
      anaesthetic as a day patient.</p>

      <p>* Smegma During the separation of the foreskin from the
      glans, epithelial cells and keratin debris collect under the
      foreskin as smegma. Sometimes these form soft white lumps, or
      'smegmomas'. These naturally discharge with eventual
      retraction of the foreskin and do not require treatment.</p>

      <p>* Balanitis xerotica obliterans BXO is a chronic
      progressive atrophic sclerosis of the glans and prepuce,
      leading to urethral stenosis. BXO is also known as lichen
      sclerosus et atrophicus of the glans.</p>

      <p>The epidermis of the foreskin becomes atrophic with areas
      of hyperkeratosis. The foreskin becomes non-retractable, and
      erections are painful. There may be spraying of urine and, in
      the later stages, urinary retention. On examination, there is
      circumferential white scarring of the distal foreskin (see
      figure 4).</p>

      <p>The treatment for BXO is circumcision with close follow-up
      to exclude meatal stenosis. In the adult population BXO has
      been proposed as a pre-malignant condition, but there is no
      evidence that childhood BXO holds any increased malignant
      risk.</p>

      <p>In the event of meatal stenosis, further surgery (such as
      meatotomy) may be required to maintain a patent urethra.<a
      href="#n6">6</a></p>

      <p>* Paraphimosis This is an acutely painful condition in
      which a retracted foreskin cannot be pulled forward over the
      glans. This usually occurs due to a narrow preputial ring,
      and represents a surgical emergency as delay can lead to
      glandular necrosis.</p>

      <p>Paraphimosis is occasionally seen in infants as a result
      of parental foreskin retraction, after advice from health
      professionals that frequent foreskin retraction is
      necessary.</p>

      <p>The prepuce can be reduced with the aid of a local or
      general anaesthetic. Following reduction, treatment is
      advised with an 8- week course of steroid cream. If this
      fails, a circumcision could be considered.</p>

      <p>SURGICAL TREATMENTS</p>

      <p>* Preputioplasty This foreskin-conserving operation is
      indicated if attempts at foreskin retraction show a clear
      fibrous ring (see figure 6) preventing full exposure of the
      glans. There are several different types, but the principle
      one involves longitudinal incision(s) down to Buck's fascia
      in the region of the phimotic band being closed transversely,
      thus broadening and loosening the foreskin. The patient is
      then encouraged to maintain foreskin retractability on a
      daily basis.</p>

      <p>* Circumcision This involves excision of a distal segment
      of foreskin and muco-cutaneous repair using absorbable
      sutures. Circumcision is often thought of as a minor
      procedure; however, it has the potential for great morbidity,
      including:</p>

      <p>* Injury to the glans penis and urethra (eg, during
      electrocautery)</p>

      <p>* Haemorrhage (occurs in 1-7 per cent)</p>

      <p>* Meatitis and meatal ulceration (8-31 per cent)</p>

      <p>* Meatal stenosis</p>

      <p>* Removal of incorrect amount of skin</p>

      <p>* Infection (4-6 per cent - see figure 7)</p>

      <p>* Urethral fistula</p>

      <p>* Unrecognised hypospadias</p>
      Cases have been recorded of gender reassignment being carried
      out because of significant complications of circumcision. We
      would recommend circumcision for only certain conditions,
      including BXO.<a href="#n1">1</a><br />

      <p>* Foreskin retractability increases with age; on average
      foreskins are 50 per cent retractable by the end of the first
      year, 75 per cent by the end of two years, and 90 per cent by
      the end of three years. <span class="crl">[CIRP Note: Here
      the authors once again parrot the inaccurate and outmoded
      data.]</span> It has also been found that the prevalence of
      non-retractable foreskins between the ages of six and 17
      years decrease from eight to one per cent without surgical
      intervention. The unretractable, non-problematic foreskin
      should therefore be considered normal up to the age of 17</p>

      <p>* Phimosis is Greek for 'muzzling'. It is the inability to
      retract the foreskin due to a narrow preputial ring. A
      pathological phimosis may be caused by recurrent infection of
      the foreskin causing scarring and narrowing of the preputial
      ring. Such narrowing is not to be confused with the

      requires no treatment. 'Ballooning' of the foreskin (urine
      collecting under the foreskin during micturition) is often
      attributed to a phimotic foreskin. If the patient does not
      have repeated episodes of infection, then ballooning is

      There may be spraying of urine and, in the later stages,
      urinary retention. On examination, there is circumferential
      white scarring of the distal foreskin. The treatment for BXO
      is circumcision with close follow-up to exclude meatal
      stenosis</p>
