        <h2>WHY ARE CHILDREN REFERRED FOR CIRCUMCISION?</h2>
        Nigel Williams, Julian Chell, Leela Kapila
      </div>

      <p>Most of the 30 000 circumcisions performed in the United
      Kingdom each year are done on boys aged under 15.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> Controversy exists over whether all
      these procedures are necessary or justified.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,2</a></sup> <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a> reported that
      the foreskin develops entirely normally and free of all
      problems in all but 1% of boys by the age of 15.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/rickwood2/">Rickwood and
      Walker</a>, however, suggest that up to 6% of boys in the
      Mersey region are circumcised by the age of 15.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> This highlights a discrepancy in the
      expected and observed rates of circumcision. To address this
      we audited all referrals from general practitioners for
      penile problems to this unit.</p>

      <h3>Patients, methods, and results</h3>

      <p>We prospectively assessed all new patients referred to
      this paediatric surgical unit for a penile problem (excluding
      hypospadias) over six months and recorded the reasons for
      referral, symptoms, and referral diagnosis. Of the 464 new
      patients seen, 69 were referred for a penile problem (median
      age 4.2 years (range 2 months - 14.3 years)).</p>

      <p>Thirty four children were referred with a request for
      circumcision, 27 for advice only, and eight for a second
      opinion. The commonest referral diagnosis were tight foreskin
      (26 cases), phimosis (25), and balanitis (9) (table). The
      nine other children were referred with unscarred
      non-retractile foreskin (6), unscarred non-retractile
      foreskin (2), and a long redundant foreskin what was
      ventrally deficient (1). The main symptoms on referral were
      balanitis (25), tight foreskin (19), ballooning on
      micturition (10), and recurrent balanitis (6). Five patients
      were referred with other symptoms: insufficent foreskin (1),
      redundant foreskin (1), mild dorsal hood (1), preputial
      adhesion (1), and inspissated smegma (1). Two were referred
      for religious and one for non-religious circumcision. For one
      child, who was asympomatic, the referral letter simply read,
      "Please see this boy regarding his foreskin."</p>

      <p>Our findings on examination were that 29 of the children
      referred had a healthy retractile foreskin and 30 had a
      healthy non-retractile foreskin. (table). Most of those in
      the second group were aged under 6. Nine children were found
      to have a phimosis.</p>

      <p>Fourteen children were listed for circumcision, nine
      because of phimosis, one because the long redundant foreskin
      caused urinary dribbling, and two for religious reasons. The
      other two children had an unscarred non-retractile foreskin
      but were listed for circumcision because of their ages (10.8
      and 14.4 years) the failure of conservative management, and
      parental pressure.</p>

      <h3>Comment</h3>

      <p>At birth the prepuce adheres to the glans in most infants.
      Separation occurs so that 15% of infants have a retractile
      foreskin at 6 months, 50% at 1 year, and more than 90% at
      three years.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> Although phimosis
      indicates a pathological state (scarring of the foreskin), it
      is also wrongly used to describe non-retractile foreskin.
      Only nine children were found to have a genuine phimosis.
      Balanitis was the commonest referral symptom. It is argued
      that a non-retractile foreskin predisposes to attacks of
      balanitis because secretions and debris are retained under
      the foreskin and may become infected. Eight of the nine boys
      referred with balanitis, however had a healthy foreskin,
      which was retractile in five. <a
      href="/library/disease/balanitis/escala1/">Escala and
      Rickwood</a> found that less than half of all boys presenting
      with balanitis had a recurrence.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Also, although a quarter of the boys
      had a fully retractile prepuce, some continued to have
      episodes of balanitis despite apparently adequate hygiene.
      The practice of separating preputial adhesions<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> is therefore contentious, and we do
      not routinely practice it. We perform religious circumcisions
      on the premise that it is better done in a suitable
      environment than in the community where it may not be done
      safely.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The statement in the paragraph
      above that more than 90% of boys have retractile foreskins
      three years of age is incorrect. It is based on more than
      half-century-old incorrect data that was supplied by Gairdner
      in 1949. Numerous later studies have shown this figure to be
      incorrect. CIRP believes that about 44% of boys have
      retractile foreskins by age ten. See <a
      href="/library/normal/">Normal Development</a> for more
      information.]</p>

      <p>Confusion over the term phimosis continues, so that many
      children are thought to have a pathological condition when
      often there is none. Greater understanding among paediatric
      surgeons and general practitioners of the definition of
      diagnoses and normal preputial development should lead to a
      decreased rate of referral and reduce anxiety of parents and
      patients.</p>
