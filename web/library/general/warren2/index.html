        <p>SUMMARY: The origin of circumcision as a form of ancient
        sacrifice is discussed. Recently described information
        about the structure and function of the prepuce is
        presented. It is suggested that the prepuce is responsible
        for much of the erogenous sensation in the penis. The
        indications for circumcision are considered. Unnecessary
        circumcisions are still being carried out. The methods and
        results of foreskin restoration in circumcised men are
        referred to. It is recommended that circumcision should be
        avoided whenever possible and that there is a need for
        further research into the location and function of sensory
        receptors in the male genitalia and the psychological
        effects of circumcision.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <br />
      <br />

      <p><font size="7">T</font>he origins of circumcision are lost
      in antiquity. Male circumcision is depicted in Egyptian tombs
      5,000 years ago <sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>, while <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a> refers to
      evidence that it has its origins long before this in
      prehistory up to 15,000 years ago <sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup>. We do not know with certainty why
      this operation was carried out, but many writers have
      suggested that it was a sacrificial rite. No doubt human
      sacrifice was widespread, and it seems likely that
      substitutes for this practice included the sacrifice of
      domestic animals and mutilations of the human body, of which
      circumcision is just one example. Circumcision would usually
      have been carried out as an initiation ordeal at about the
      time of puberty, but there was a tendency for the age at
      which it was performed to shift earlier, so that Jewish
      ritual circumcision has been carried out on the eighth day of
      life since biblical times.</p>

      <p>Ritual circumcision is particularly popular and widespread
      geographically. An important aspect of sacrifice is the
      shedding of blood, and circumcision is a notoriously bloody
      operation, and even in modern surgical conditions haemorrhage
      can be a problem. A rate of up to 2% is reported by Denton
      <sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>, sometimes requiring blood
      transfusion. <a href="/library/general/gellis1/">Gellis</a>
      <sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> reported that there were more
      deaths in the USA from the complications of circumcision than
      from carcinoma of the penis. One can only guess what the
      mortality from haemorrhage and infections might be in
      primitive or ancient communities.</p>

      <p>Another aspect of sacrifice is that the object which is
      forfeited should be valuable. The greater the value of the
      object sacrificed, the more worthy the sacrifice. This should
      make us wonder what are the value and function of the
      prepuce. If it were just a useless flap of skin, it would not
      be much of a sacrifice, and one might just as well shave off
      one's beard or cut one's toenails. Evidence will be provided
      below to indicate that the prepuce plays a major role in
      ensuring the sensitivity of the penis during sexual acts and
      that circumcision greatly reduces the possibilities of
      pleasurable sensations. This makes it an ideal sacrificial
      object, as the circumcised male is able to function normally
      in society and to procreate, but suffers permanent impairment
      of sexual enjoyment and bears a visible, life-long reminder
      of his sacrifice.</p>

      <p><font face="arial black">The development, structure and
      function of the prepuce</font></p>

      <p>Although the penis in general is well described in the
      medical literature as regards its structure and function, not
      much attention has been paid to the prepuce. It is generally
      described as a fold of skin which protects the glans. Its
      embryological development has been described by Gairdner
      <sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>, who also described how its
      development is incomplete at birth and that separation of the
      prepuce from the glans takes place at a variable time in
      childhood, 90% being separated by the age of 3 years.
      &Oslash;ster <sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> described what
      happens to the remaining 10% and showed that if these penises
      were not interfered with, natural separation would follow in
      all but 1% by the age of 17.</p>

      <p>Taylor in a preliminary, unpublished study presented at <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/second/index.html">The
      Second International Symposium on Circumcision</a>, San
      Francisco, 1991, looked at autopsy material and surgical
      specimens. He showed that the amount of skin lost by
      circumcision in the adult is 5-8 cms. in length. He also
      looked at the structure of the skin that was lost. The outer
      layer resembles skin elsewhere on the penile shaft, but the
      inner layer is very different. In the child and young adult
      it is tightly folded, but it tends to become flattened in
      older men. He described a fold which he called the frenar
      band at the mucocutaneous junction, merging with the
      frenulum. This <a href="http://research.cirp.org/">band</a>
      is particularly rich in Meissner nerve endings. He showed
      that this part had a rich blood supply, which it shared with
      the corpora cavernosa and glans. The histological appearance
      resembled mucosa rather than skin as it lacked hair
      follicles, sweat glands and sebaceous glands. The structure
      resembled most closely that of the labia minora. However no
      neurophysiological studies have been carried out on the
      prepuce and at present there is insufficient knowledge to
      understand its function fully. But the anatomy suggests that
      the prepuce plays an important role as a specialised sense
      organ. <font color="navy">[CIRP note: <a
      href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">Taylor's findings</a> were
      later published and are now available.]</font></p>

      <p>It is strange that doctors in Western countries will not
      permit female circumcision, which involves removal of some or
      all of the erogenous tissue from the vulva for reasons other
      than major pathology such as malignancy, but will permit, and
      in some cases encourage, the removal of the male prepuce,
      which is identical to the female prepuce in its embryological
      development, cell structure, and nerve and blood supply
      <sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>Bigelow <sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> reports that the
      prepuce has four functions. Firstly, it is itself sensitive
      due to the nerve endings on its inner surface, which become
      exposed during sexual arousal. Secondly, it protects the
      glans. The protected glans remains soft, moist and sensitive
      throughout life, but the exposed glans of the circumcised
      male becomes increasingly thickened and desensitised. Were
      this not so it would be impossible for a circumcised man to
      tolerate the abrasion of clothing on the exposed glans.
      Thirdly, the mobile sheath of skin on the intact penis allows
      the prepuce to slide back and forth over the glans during
      foreplay and intercourse. Ritter calls this action "the
      pleasure dynamic" <sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>. Fourthly,
      <span class="yellow">it provides slack skin on the shaft of
      the erect penis allowing it to glide within its own sheath of
      skin during intercourse. This provides for more enjoyable
      intercourse for both partners and avoids problems with
      vaginal dryness.</span></p>

      <p><font face="arial black">Reasons for
      circumcision</font></p>

      <p>Circumcision may be carried out for one of three reasons:
      1, religious, 2, social, 3 medical. So far as religious
      requirements to circumcise go, it is not for doctors to argue
      with someone who believes that God requires him to amputate
      his prepuce. All the doctor can do is advise him how to carry
      out the operation safely and humanely.</p>

      <p>Social reasons include, for example, the request to
      circumcise a child so he will look like his father. In the
      past many doctors have accepted such requests for
      circumcision without question, and undoubtedly this is still
      the case in some places.</p>

      <p>Medical indications have varied at different times and in
      different parts of the world. Doctors' views on circumcision
      may roughly be divided into three positions: Position 1:-
      pro-circumcision. Doctors who hold this view believe that the
      prepuce serves no useful purpose and that it is liable to
      become diseased and therefore is best removed as a matter of
      public health and hygiene. They may subscribe to the view
      that smegma is an important cause of carcinoma of the cervix
      and penis. Some believe erroneously that circumcision
      protects against sexually transmitted diseases. They often
      also recommend that the operation should be carried out as
      early as possible, when, as some still believe, pain is not
      experienced as it is in the older child or adult. It has been
      claimed that routine neonatal circumcision reduces the
      incidence of urinary tract infections in infancy <sup><a
      href="#n9">9,10,11</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>Position 2:- the neutral position. Doctors who subscribe
      to this view will say that routine neonatal circumcision is
      not necessary, since most boys will never require
      circumcision, and to carry it out unnecessarily subjects a
      child to risk and pain and is a waste of resources. However
      they will readily recommend circumcision in cases of
      tightness of the prepuce or difficulty in retracting it over
      the age of, say, 5 years or if asked to do so by the
      parents.</p>

      <p>Position 3:- the anti-circumcision position. Those who
      subscribe to this view believe that the prepuce has an
      important function and should be preserved whenever possible,
      and that its loss seriously impairs sexual functioning and
      pleasure.</p>

      <p><font face="arial black">Where are we now?</font></p>

      <p>In Britain the pro-circumcision view appears to have been
      popular during the 1930's and 1940's, as it was in other
      English-speaking countries. The advent of the National Health
      Service in 1948 and the publication of Gairdner's <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">paper</a> in 1949 <sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup>, when at least 20% of boys were
      circumcised, caused a shift to the neutral position in
      Britain in the 1950's and 1960's. Neither of these factors
      appears to have had any effect in the USA where
      pro-circumcision attitudes have held sway up to the present
      day, and the current neonatal circumcision rate is estimated
      at 59%, having been 85% in 1980 <sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup>. The Task Force on Circumcision stated
      that newborn circumcision has potential medical benefits and
      advantages as well as disadvantages and risks <sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>However, attitudes in Britain do not appear to have
      shifted beyond the neutral position in spite of
      &Oslash;ster's <a href="/library/general/oster/">paper</a> in
      1968 <sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>. The indications for
      circumcision were discussed by <a
      href="/library/general/gordon/">Gordon and Collin</a>
      recently <sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>. They estimate that
      1 to 2% of boys need circumcision for medical reasons. Those
      whose prepuce remains non-retractile at 17 are probably
      suffering from balanitis xerotica obliterans <sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup>. However the cumulative national
      circumcision rate in Britain is currently 6.6% <sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup>. It was shown in audits of patients
      referred for circumcision that there was a great deal of
      misunderstanding about the meaning of phimosis, which was
      overdiagnosed by referring doctors <sup><a
      href="#n16">16,17</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>Smegma has been blamed as a carcinogenic agent. However,
      it is produced by every mammalian species, both male and
      female. If it were carcinogenic this would be a serious
      mistake by Nature, which would threaten the survival of this
      successful class of vertebrates. Penile carcinoma is
      described in Jews, though it is rare, and there is no marked
      difference in incidence between USA where circumcision is
      almost universal and Scandinavian countries where it is
      rarely carried out <sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>. Likewise,
      cervical carcinoma is no less common in USA than in
      non-circumcising countries <sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup>.</p>

      <p>There have been a number of reports of the evidence for
      pain experienced by neonates undergoing circumcision <sup><a
      href="#n18">18,19,20</a></sup>.</p>

      <p><font face="arial black">Reasons for not
      circumcising</font></p>

      <p>Until recently the structure and function of the prepuce
      have not been known. Now its important function as a major
      source of erogenous sensation on the penis has been
      recognised. Not only is the circumcised man deprived of this
      sensation, but also his glans becomes thickened and
      insensitive. The reader may be puzzled why this was not known
      before. Males are nearly always circumcised in childhood, and
      so they pass through all their sexually active years with a
      circumcised penis and therefore have no concept of what
      normal feeling is. Furthermore, men do not generally discuss
      their erotic experiences in great detail with one another,
      assuming that all share the same experiences.</p>

      <p>In North America many circumcised men are now becoming
      aware of their mutilation and the harm that this has done
      them, and some are starting to seek methods of replacing the
      lost prepuce. This can be achieved surgically, and a number
      of operations are described in the literature <sup><a
      href="#n21">21,22,</a></sup>. Foreskin restoration can also
      be achieved by nonsurgical tissue expansion techniques,
      described by Bigelow <sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>. Men who
      have restored their prepuce describe remarkable improvement
      in the erogenous sensitivity of the glans and satisfactory
      restoration of the interaction between the prepuce and the
      glans, <span class="yellow">together with a discovery of the
      gliding action of slack skin on the shaft</span>, which they
      will not have known before. Even though the unique structure
      of the inner lining of the prepuce can never be recreated,
      such men report satisfaction with the results of foreskin
      restoration.</p>

      <p>In view of this knowledge, it is time the medical
      profession reviewed the indications for circumcision. There
      is no excuse for amputating normal prepuces that are merely
      slow to separate. Where genuine phimosis has occurred,
      consideration should be given to conservative surgery, such
      as preputioplasty. Doctors should consider carefully before
      demanding the sacrifice of the most sensitive part of the
      penis, particularly when, as is often the case, the patient
      is a child not old enough to understand what is being
      done.</p>

      <p><font face="arial black">Conclusion</font></p>

      <p>There is a need for further research into the location of
      erogenous sensation in the male genitalia, the structure and
      function of the prepuce and the psychological effects of
      circumcision, which have not yet been fully evaluated. In the
      mean time, surgeons should be encouraged to preserve as much
      penile tissue as possible.</p>
