      <h3>Circumcision</h3>

      <p class="text1"><i>To the Editor</i>.---I was most gratified
      by <a href="/library/general/preston/">Captain Preston on
      neonatal circumcision</a>. The study is noteworthy both for
      its scientific objectivity and for the deeply human concern
      expressed by the author.</p>

      <p class="text1">In the 19 years since my graduation from
      medical school and subsequent arrival in the United States, I
      have continued to be shocked at the arbitrariness of the
      thoughtless mutilation of so many boys. The medical demerits
      of the procedure are well outlined in Captain Preston's
      article. As a member of a civilized community, I should like
      to bring up for consideration two additional points.</p>

      <p class="text1">The <i>aesthetic</i> pleasure commonly
      associated with the visual contemplation of the healthy and
      intact human body is seriously damaged in the case of a
      circumcised male. Many sensitive individuals, especially
      those unaccustomed to it, tend to view the circumcised penis
      with the same feeling of horror induced by the amputee
      without a nose or an ear.</p>

      <p class="text1"><span class="yellow">The <i>sensory</i>
      pleasure induced by tactile stimulation of the foreskin is
      almost totally lost after its surgical removal.</span> The
      surface of the exposed glans, as we know, has no capacity to
      receive and transmit any fine sensations of touch, heat, etc.
      Consequently, the fundamental biological sexual act becomes,
      for the circumcised male, simply a satisfaction of an urge
      and not the refined sensory experience that it was meant to
      be.</p>

      <p class="text1">In the United States only the children of
      very well educated parents escape neonatal circumcision. Let
      us hope that further enlightenment of parents and doctors
      will spare many more boys the ordeal of this amputation.</p>
