        <h3>Circumcision</h3>

        <p>To The Editor:</p>

        <p class="text">In reply to <cite>The Journal</cite>, Sept.
        18, 1954, page 292, to a question about the advisability of
        circumcising all newborn male infants, it should be noted
        that the opinion is that of a urologist based on his
        observations of his own patients. His sample of the male
        population can hardly be considered representative, since
        the vast majority of men go through life without ever
        consulting a urologists. His observations may be valid, but
        his perspective is necessarily limited.</p>

        <p class="text">As a general practitioner in a rural area
        where less than 0.3% of the adult males are circumcised, I
        am impressed with the rarity of any disease that could be
        honestly blamed on the foreskin. Further, it would appear
        that the normal prepuce is of advantage to its owner,
        protecting the sensitivity of the glans and supplying the
        integument to accommodate penile growth at puberty and
        enlargement during erection. Its unnecessary removal seems
        unphysiological. The conviction that the normal foreskin is
        a nuisance is held exclusively by the circumcised. There
        have been attempts to rationalize the procedure along many
        lines. Prior to 1900 a great deal was published about the
        value of circumcision in the prophylaxis and treatment of
        masturbation, feeble-mindedness, epilepsy, spastic
        paralysis, and even diabetes and tuberculosis. More recent
        essays in this direction have been equally bizarre. A study
        by Dr. Ernest L. Wynder relates carcinoma of the cervix to
        uncircumcised husbands. The idea that smegma, the
        desquamated epithelium of the glans, could have any
        significant carcinogenic activity seems absurd. Penile
        cancer is rare in the United States. That any significant
        amount of this substance is deposited on the cervix during
        coitus also seems absurd.</p>
