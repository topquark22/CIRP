      <p class="heading"><b>A RITUAL OPERATION</b></p>

      <p class="text1">Little is known of the origin of
      circumcision, despite the very considerable literature on the
      subject.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; At its
      inception the practice seems to have had an essentially
      religious connotation and to have arisen independently in the
      continents of Africa, America, and Australia.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Among the Semitic races it is probable that circumcision
      started as as act of consecration to the goddess of fertility
      with the object of winning her favour and thus ensuring the
      birth of children.&nbsp;&nbsp; Circumcision in ancient Egypt
      was certainly not undertaken for hygienic reasons, and
      probably it served as a sanctification of the reproductive
      faculties and a ceremonial initiation.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is
      likely that the ancient Pharaohs were circumcised, the
      circumcised state being a necessary qualification for the
      priesthood.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is reported that Pythagoras had
      himself circumcised while in Egypt so he might be fully
      initiated into the esoteric religious rites of the
      Egyptians.&nbsp;&nbsp; Among others, notably the American
      Indians, circumcision was mainly adopted as an alternative to
      human sacrifice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although circumcision is
      widespread in Moslem communities the Koran contains no
      specific ordinance on this subject.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mohammed is
      said to have been born without a prepuce, and the possession
      of a foreskin was regarded as a disgrace amongst the
      Arabs.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is reported that after one of the
      Prophet&rsquo;s battles a slain Thaquafite tribesman was
      found uncircumcised, and great pains were taken to prove that
      he was a Christian and not truly a member of the
      tribe.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Arab communities the operation is
      performed with scissors, a razor, or a split reed, and there
      is a tradition that Abraham used an axe and was rebuked for
      his haste.</p>

      <p class="text2">Some of the methods of disposal of the
      foreskin are more a matter for interest than
      emulation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Levites during the Exodus piled
      their foreskins in the wilderness and covered them with earth
      ; in parts of West Africa, where the operation is performed
      at about 8 years of age, the prepuce is dipped in brandy and
      eaten by the patient ; in other districts the operator is
      enjoined to consume the fruits of his handiwork, and yet a
      further practice, in Madagascar, is to wrap the operation
      specifically in a banana leaf and feed it to a
      calf.&nbsp;&nbsp; In happy contrast to some of these macabre
      practices is the habit of the Bani Chams in Australia with a
      wooden knife and leave their victims unscathed.</p>

      <p class="text2">In Britain, while the practice of
      circumcision is widespread, there are rather different
      reasons for its performance, and, though exact figures are
      difficult to obtain, it would seem that more than half the
      male members of the population are circumcised.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Many doctors have for long rebelled against the wholesale and
      somewhat primitive lopping of the infant foreskin which goes
      on in some out-patient departments and surgeries.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      On these occasions the technique of the operation is
      frequently deplorable ; sacrifice of skin is often too
      generous, and attendant damage to the glans penis or fraenum
      is not unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp; If these criticisms are valid
      then it may well be asked why large numbers of doctors permit
      and encourage a practice which so savours of the
      barbaric.&nbsp;&nbsp; Religious considerations apart, it is
      not easy to find a rational argument for circumcision in most
      cases, and the operation is more often performed because it
      is <i>de rigueur</i> in certain districts or a habit in some
      families.</p>

      <p class="text2">Dr. Douglas Gairdner&rsquo;s valuable study,
      &ldquo;<a href="/library/general/gairdner/">The Fate of the
      Foreskin</a>,&rdquo; which appears at page 1433 in this
      issue, will, we believe, make many readers pause for
      reflection.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though medical opinion about
      circumcision may be more conservative than it used to be, yet
      even to-day the attitude of the profession in general to the
      subject is too often based upon false ideas of the anatomy
      and physiology of what is a useful cutaneous
      appendage.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the value of the prepuce in the
      first two or three years of life there is no doubt, for it
      has an important function in covering and protecting the
      glans penis.&nbsp;&nbsp; Contrary to widespread belief,
      non-retractability, a frequent finding, is not synonymous
      with phimosis.&nbsp;&nbsp; There can be little medical
      justification for routine circumcision of the infant, and the
      operation is only occasionally necessary under the age of
      3.&nbsp;&nbsp; After this age operation is indicated for
      cases of non-retractability with true phimosis and for those
      with recurrent preputial inflammation or
      paraphimosis.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="yellow">Circumcision
      should be limited in extent: the fraenal region must not be
      damaged, and sufficient skin must be left to cover the very
      sensitive corona glandis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Although the
      operation of dorsal slit is unpopular with some, it is both
      satisfactory and simple to perform, and the ultimate cosmetic
      outcome is good.</p>

      <p class="text2">Apart from the local reasons for
      circumcision it is argued by some that it will reduce the
      incidence of venereal disease, cancer of the penis, and
      cancer of the cervix uteri.&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence
      supporting the first of these contentions is inconclusive ;
      the second is established beyond doubt ; while the available
      data on cancer of the cervix do not warrant the conclusions
      which have been drawn by some authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Dr.
      Gairdner points out, it is likely that lack of cleanliness is
      more important than lack of circumcision in the case of
      venereal diseases and cancer of the penis.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the
      latter was not a very uncommon disease in this country it
      alone might provide justification for widespread emulation of
      the Jewish custom.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mosaic law enjoins the
      practice of circumcision on the eighth day, and it appears
      certain that this ritual circumcision affords complete
      protection against carcinoma of the penis.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Furthermore it has been shown that circumcision between the
      third and fourteenth years of life does not give complete
      protection against penile carcinoma.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of more
      convincing evidence about carcinoma of the cervix it is
      difficult to describe its low incidence in Jewesses to the
      circumcision of their spouses.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Kennaway<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> has pointed out, the data are
      inadequate, and the low incidence in certain other races
      cannot be explained by circumcision.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems
      safe to say that if Dr. Gairdner&rsquo;s recommendations are
      accepted much circumcisional morbidity and mortality will be
      avoided and, further, that there is no good reason to fear
      increased incidence of venereal disease or genital cancer as
      a result of this policy.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The statement that "ritual
      circumcision affords complete protection against carcinoma of
      the penis" was generally believed to be correct in 1949, but
      this is now known to be false. For more information see <a
