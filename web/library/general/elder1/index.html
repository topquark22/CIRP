      <h2>Circumcision&mdash;Are You With us or Against us?</h2>

      <p class="text2"><span class="init">I</span>n the United
      States most pediatric urologists are involved with a
      significant number of circumcision issues, such as a request
      for circumcision by parents, concerns over penile adhesions
      in uncircumcised and circumcised boys, hidden penis, trapped
      penis, phimosis, suspected balanitis and incomplete
      circumcision. In this country more than 60% of newborns are
      circumcised, although the rate varies based on ethnic
      background, geographic region and insurance status.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1,2</a></sup> In contrast, European men generally
      are circumcised only for religious reasons. Furthermore, when
      hypospadias repair is performed, often the foreskin is
      preserved. Recently we published an article in <i>The Journal
      of Urology</i>&reg; by Schoen et al describing the higher
      costs associated with postneonatal circumcision compared with
      neonatal circumcision.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> In short
      order, numerous letters to the editor were submitted, some of
      which were critical of the analysis, while others indicated
      that the analysis did not consider potential benefits in
      adulthood for men and their sexual partners. Several of these
      letters are published in this issue of The Journal, and
      provide a flavor of the controversy.</p>

      <p class="text2">Few pediatric urological topics generate as
      much passion among nonurologist physicians (and some
      pediatric urologists) and lay people as newborn circumcision.
      Several years ago an outspoken proponent of circumcision who
      was invited to speak at a national conference on the topic in
      San Francisco made his hotel reservation under a different
      name because of concerns regarding anti-circumcision
      activists.</p>

      <p class="text2">Newborn circumcision is the most common
      &ldquo;operation&rdquo; performed in the United States but it
      is done primarily for cosmetic reasons or because the parents
      think that it will afford better hygiene. There is also a
      perception that circumcision in adulthood is much more
      painful than in the newborn period. A tour through the
      newborn nursery when babies are lined up for circumcision
      might change this opinion, although penile blocks are
      helpful. The risk for circumcision complications is
      significant, and most parents seem unaware about those risks
      when signing the consent form. There are potential health
      benefits to circumcision, including reduction in the risk of
      pyelonephritis in infancy, penile cancer in adulthood and HIV
      in sub-Saharan Africa.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> Do these
      potential health benefits mean that all boys should be
      circumcised? <span class="yellow">No.</span> In fact, the
      health &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; and risks of circumcision are
      evenly balanced by the advantages and &ldquo;risks&rdquo; of
      being uncircumcised.</p>

      <p class="text2">Some argue that circumcision violates
      medical ethics,<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> and medical
      practitioners who perform circumcision should be aware of
      these ideas. There is another ethical issue with regard to
      newborn circumcision and the practice of surgery. A principle
      of surgery is that the surgeon is responsible for
      postoperative care, and identifies and manages surgical
      complications, calling in consultants as necessary. In most
      communities newborn circumcision is performed by
      nonurologists, most commonly obstetricians, although it also
      is performed by pediatricians and family physicians. When
      obstetricians perform the procedure, generally they do not
      see the child at followup to assess healing, and they assume
      that the primary care physician will manage the postoperative
      care. If there is a complication such as infection, trapped
      penis or incomplete circumcision, usually the problem is
      identified by the pediatrician or family physician and the
      urologist is asked to take care of the problem. Typically the
      obstetrician is unaware of the complication. I have also
      encountered obstetricians who have refused to place sutures
      to control bleeding following Gomco circumcision because they
      were &ldquo;uncomfortable&rdquo; suturing such a small
      structure.</p>

      <p class="text2">The arguments will continue and,
      unfortunately, there is little room for compromise. It is
      important that families be aware of the risks of circumcision
      and practitioners be aware of the ethical arguments against
      routine circumcision. <span class="yellow">Furthermore, since
      it is a cosmetic procedure, the cost of circumcision should
      be paid out of pocket rather than by the insurance company or
      by the public in cases of Medicaid.</span></p>
