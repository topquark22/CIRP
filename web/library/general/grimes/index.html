      <h1>Routine circumcision of the newborn infant:<br />
       A reappraisal</h1>

       <span class="c2"><i>Atlanta, Georgia</i></span></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="2">Prompted by the continuing controversy over
        routine circumcision of the newborn infant, this review of
        the limited available literature suggests that the
        operation may facilitate hygiene of the penis and perhaps
        decrease the risk of carcinoma of the penis. On the other
        hand the operation frequently features illogical basis for
        patient selection, neglect of the requirement to obtain
        informed consent, an inappropriate operator, a needlessly
        radical technique, disregard for pain, dubious objectives,
        and unknown cost effectiveness. Long-term prospective
        studies are needed to evaluate routine circumcision of the
        newborn infant. However until the benefits of the procedure
        can be proved worth the risk and cost, medical resources
        should probably be allocated to heath measures of
        demonstrated value. (A<span class="c3">M</span>. J. O<span
        class="c3">BSTET</span>. G<span class="c3">YNECOL</span>
        130: 125, 1978)</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="c5">I<span class="c2">N</span> <a
      href="/library/statements/aap/#1975">1975</a>, T<span
      class="c2">HE</span> American Academy of Pediatrics
      reaffirmed its <a href="/library/statements/aap/#1971">1971
      judgment</a> that routine circumcision of the newborn infant
      lacks medical justification.<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> Nevertheless, the <a
      href="http://www.acog.org/">American College of Obstetricians
      and Gynecologists</a>, whose members annually perform
      hundreds of thousands of circumcisions, declined to endorse
      this position statement in its present form. This disparity
      between these viewpoints prompts reconsideration of routine
      newborn circumcision as a surgical procedure, in terms of:
      (1) patient selection, (2) informed consent, (3) choice of
      operator, (4) surgical technique, (5) anesthesia management,
      (6) objectives, and (7) cost-effectiveness.</p>

      <p class="c6">Patient Selection</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of a
      complaint or demonstrable pathology, the selection of
      candidates for any operation becomes problematic. The
      foreskins of 96 per cent of newborn infants cannot be fully
      retracted and, hence "phimosis" is physiologic in the newborn
      infant.<span class="c2"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></span>
      The inner surface of the prepuce and the glans share a common
      epithelium, erroneously termed "adhesions," which separates
      around the time of birth or potentially much later. At birth,
      determining which children will subsequently develop
      clinically significant phimosis is impossible.</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus lacking a rational
      means of case finding, the physician frequently relegates the
      decision to the mother, who may base her decision on
      incomplete or erroneous information. Women's (and men's)
      understanding of circumcision may be limited. For example,
      the number of women who do not know the circumcisional status
      of their marital partner ranges from 10 to 50 per cent.</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surveys of parents to
      determine the rationale for having their newborn sons
      circumcised are ever more revealing. Some had their sons
      circumcised to prevent excessive crying, masturbation or
      "rupture." Others acted on advice from relatives or women's
      magazines, while still others believed that circumcision is
      required for admission to the armed forces.<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> In another
      study, mothers based their decision on the belief that
      circumcision was mandatory hospital policy, that the penis
      would be rendered more aesthetic, that all male infant are
      circumcised or that circumcision is required by law.<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> While
      fathers tend to be indifferent about circumcision, physicians
      clearly influence the incidence of circumcisions, ranging in
      one study from 20 per cent of patients of physicians who
      opposed circumcision to 100 per cent of patients who
      supported the procedure.<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

      <p class="c7">Informed consent</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although signed consent
      is routinely obtained before newborn circumcision, the
      requirement for <i>informed</i> consent is satisfied far less
      often. "Informed consent," as interpreted by Annas,<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n4">5</a></sup></span> denotes two
      elements: information and consent. The physician
      contemplating operation ostensibly must relate to the patient
      (or here, parents) all material facts related to the proposed
      operation. He must reveal the risks of morbidity and death,
      the probability of success, and he alternatives to treatment,
      i. e. non-circumcision or later circumcision. Furthermore, he
      must describe the attendant risks and probability of success
      of the alternatives to operation as well.</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physicians often
      neglect the informational component of informed consent for
      circumcision. Shaw and Robertson<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> documented that 57 of 80
      mothers (72) per cent denied that a physician had ever
      discussed circumcision with them. Patel<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> reported
      that parents discussed circumcision with the doctor in only
      34 of 100 cases.</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annas<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> further
      argues that the more elective the proposed operation, the
      more crucial is a complete explanation of the material facts.
      That the parents must consent to elective operation on the
      genitals of an uncomprehending minor magnifies the importance
      of this disclosure. Newborn circumcision is not innocuous.
      While the risk of death from circumcision is small,
      approximately two deaths per million procedures,<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> the risks of
      complications range from 0.06<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> to 55<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> per cent in different studies,
      reflecting large differences in patient follow-up and in
      definitions of complications.</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate complications
      of circumcision have been classified into three categories:
      hemorrhage, infection, and surgical trauma.<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> Hemorrhage
      is the most frequent complication and may require sutures,
      pressure dressings, or transfusion.<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n2">2,3</a></sup></span> In Patel's<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> recent study
      of 100 patients, 31 had minimal bleeding and four had
      moderate bleeding. One infant required suturing.</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infection of the wound
      can lead to scarring, deformity, and phimosis. Seven of the
      same 100 patients had mild wound infections, and one had a
      severe infection requiring antibiotics.<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> Exposed to
      irritation caused by the ammonia of wet diapers, the
      unprotected glans may develop meatal ulceration or meatitis,
      predisposing to meatal stenosis.<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n1">1,2</a></sup></span> Thirty of 100 patients
      sustained mild meatal ulcerations, while one child had a
      severe ulceration.<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surgical mishaps
      continue to occur, particularly in inexperienced hands. A
      partial inventory of operative accidents and their sequalae
      includes denuding of the penis shaft; incomplete circumcision
      with residual deformity; lacerated scrotum; subglanular
      fistula; bivalved, grooved or amputated glans; concealed
      penis; and cautery burns.<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> Most case reports lack
      denominator data, and the incidence of surgical trauma
      remains unknown.</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three neonatal cases of
      urine retention due to circumcision, with one child
      presenting with septic shock, have recently been described.
      In addition, the complication of septicemia has led to
      osteomyelitis, pulmonary abscesses, and death.</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As outlined by
      Annas,<span class="c2"><sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></span>
      informed consent for circumcision necessitates an explanation
      of its hazards. If the incidence of immediate complications
      were as low as 0.06 per cent,<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> the immediate risk from
      nontreatment would probably still be lower. Delayed
      complications of circumcision are allegedly more
      frequent,<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> although their incidence is
      unknown. The long term consequences on non-circumcision
      likewise are not well documented. Prospective studies are
      needed to resolve these questions. Nevertheless, millions of
      uncircumcised male subjects in Western nations tolerate their
      foreskins with minimal disability.<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the need
      for circumcision arises in later life, the procedure can then
      be done with the full understanding and informed consent of
      the patient himself, as well as with the benefits of
      anesthesia and analgesia. While circumcision of an adult
      requires more time and costs more than does circumcision of a
      newborn infant, the ratio of the risks of the operation at
      these ages is unknown.</p>

      <p class="c7">Choice of operator</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do
      obstetricians-gynecologists perform circumcisions? The
      requisite skills can certainly be acquired, if needed, by the
      infant's primary care physician. Performance of the
      circumcision by the child's rather than by the mother's
      physician might foster better postoperative care of the wound
      and prevent complications. The child's physician routinely
      counsels the mother about infant care; wound management could
      easily be included in these discussions.
      Obstetrician-gynecologists seldom see the circumcision
      patient for follow-up; however the child's physician will be
      examining him at regular intervals during immunization. and
      well baby visits beginning at six to 12 weeks of age.</p>

      <p class="c5">Moreover, routine performance of newborn
      circumcisions ostensibly should threaten an
      obstetrician-gynecologist's specialty certification.
      Commenting on limitations of practice for candidates, the <a
      href="http://www.abog.org/">American Board of Obstetrics and
      Gynecology, Inc.</a>,<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> warns that "physicians who
      assume responsibility for the health of male patients for
      operative or other care, will not be regarded as specialists
      in obstetrics-gynecology, except as this practice is related
      to governmental services, the investigation and management of
      on infertility problem, or care in an emergency.</p>

      <p class="c7">Surgical technique</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the goals of
      circumcision are diverse, critical evaluation of available
      techniques is difficult. For example, what constitutes
      adequate circumcision? Judging from amounts of foreskin
      excised, one infers that there is no consensus at all.
      Surgical outcomes of circumcision reveal striking latitude,
      ranging from the glans being completely covered by prepuce to
      being completely uncovered.<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

      <p class="c5">However if one assumes that the immediate
      objective is to enable retraction of the foreskin (a
      nonphysiologic maneuver), less drastic operative techniques
      will suffice. The dorsal slit represents an established
      urologic position, and Diaz and Kantor<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> have
      proposed the dorsal slit as an alternative to circumferential
      circumcision in newborn infants. The advantages of this
      technique may include the elimination of tissue excision as
      well as reductions in operating time and surgical risk.</p>

      <p class="c8">Anesthesia management</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That an adult can
      physically restrain an infant in order to perform genital
      surgery on him is unquestioned; that to do so is
      compassionate is less apparent. Physicians apply different
      standards of pain tolerance to newborn infants, perhaps
      because these patients cannot articulate their anguish. If
      the physician were requested to circumcise a one-year-old
      child, would he rely on physical restraints in lieu of
      anesthesia? Operation without anesthesia indeed obviates
      risks associated with anesthesia but recalls a more primitive
      area of medicine.</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequent rejoinder
      that the tiny patient does not feel pain defies both
      experimental evidence and common experience. Although
      thresholds of stimulation vary, newborn infants are capable
      of responding not only to pain but also to visual, auditory,
      tactile. gustatory, and olfactory stimuli. Reciprocally, at
      least four physiologic systems in the neonate may reflect
      stress or tension: the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular
      system, respiratory system, and skin.</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marked flushing
      frequently occurs during circumcision, and the propensity of
      newborn infants to vomit under the stress of circumcision is
      well appreciated by nursery personnel. The alteration in
      pitch and intensity of cry when the first crushing clamp is
      applied to the foreskin is unmistakable. Endocrine and other
      physiologic responses of the infant to the stress of
      circumcision have not been well documented in the existing
      literature.<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, plasma
      cortisol increased significantly in newborn infants
      circumcised in the first six hours of life in one study.<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> In addition,
      newborn circumcision has led to immediate and significant
      increases in wakefulness and fussy crying of these infants,
      as well as alterations in sleep patterns, attributed to the
      stress of operation.</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to the
      sometimes dramatic somatic responses of the neonate to
      operation without anesthesia, the psychological consequences
      of this trauma are conjectural. Psychoanalyst Erik Erickson
      has described the first of eight stages of man as the
      development of basic trust versus basic mistrust. For the
      baby to be plucked from his bed, strapped in a spread eagle
      position, and doused with chilling antiseptic is perhaps
      consistent with other new-found discomforts of extrauterine
      existence. The application of crushing clamps and excision of
      penile tissue, however, probably do little to engender a
      trusting, congenial, relationship with the infants new
      surroundings.</p>

      <p class="c7">Surgical objectives</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physicians' reasons for
      advocating routine circumcision include cleanliness;
      prevention of balanoposthitis, future phimosis, or cancer (in
      men and women); failure of the foreskin to retract; and
      custom.<span class="c2"><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></span>
      Welch<span class="c2"><sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></span>
      has has classified surgery as follows: repair of wounds,
      extirpation of diseased organs or tissue, reconstructive
      surgery, and physiologic surgery (e. g. sympathectomy).
      Predictably routine newborn circumcision eludes
      classification. Contemporary surgery has yet to embrace the
      philosophy of purely prophylactic surgery. If, however, the
      scope of surgery broadens to encompass preventive operations,
      the prepuce of the neonate will likely rank low on a list of
      bodily parts requiring ablation.</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted by the
      American Academy of Pediatrics and others,<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n1">1,2</a></sup></span> medical
      justification for routine circumcision of the newborn is
      wanting. However, some, dissenting with the Academy's
      findings, claim that the Academy's report failed to emphasize
      adequately the preventive and hygienic advantages of
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newborn circumcision
      usually prevents later circumcision but at an expense of
      hundreds of thousands of needless operations per year.
      Moreover, since phimosis is a potential complication of
      circumcision, some infants have to be circumcised more than
      once. (1 per cent of patients in one study).<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While circumcision may
      be protective against the development of cancer of the penis,
      good hygiene afford an equal degree of protection.<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n1">1,2</a></sup></span> Studies
      from diverse cultures indicate that carcinoma of the penis is
      rare among men with good hygiene, regardless of
      circumcisional status. Among men with poor hygiene,
      circumcision offers little protection.<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> Gee and
      Ansell<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> estimated the risk of
      developing cancer of the penis as less than that of suffering
      a major complication of circumcision (0.2 per cent); one
      occurs in adulthood and the other at a few days of age. No
      reliable data support a correlation between lack of
      circumcision and carcinoma of the prostate,<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> and the
      postulated association between lack of circumcision now
      appears groundless.<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumcision may
      facilitate cleaning of the distal penis, but is operation a
      legitimate means of improving hygiene? To advocate newborn
      circumcision because small boys go camping for three weeks
      without ever bathing raises other possibilities of operation
      in lieu of soap, water and instruction in cleanliness. One
      author has postulated excision of the external ears to
      eliminate these reservoirs of dirt. Simple vulvectomies of
      newborn female infants might facilitate cleanliness and
      reduce risks of vulvitis in young girls as well as carcinoma
      of the vulva in older women. Fingernails loom as yet another
      respository of filth and potential disease vector.</p>

      <p class="c7">Cost-effectiveness</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No health program
      should be evaluated in a vacuum; instead, the benefits of the
      program should be compared with the benefits that would have
      accrued had the same funds and energies be expended in
      alternate programs.<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> Although the health value of
      newborn circumcision has been alleged, its cost-effectiveness
      ration remains to be established.</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Routine newborn
      circumcision constitutes a health program of large
      proportions, for newborn circumcision is probably the most
      frequently performed operation in the United States.</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the assumption
      that 80 per cent of the 1,608,326 males born in 1973 were
      circumcised, approximately 1,287,000 newborn foreskins were
      excised during that year. When newborn infants and patients
      in federal hospitals are excluded, in 1973, the most frequent
      operation in the United States was diagnostic curettage
      (934,000 cases).</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost in dollars of
      excising 1,287,000 foreskins is substantial.
      Demetrakopoulos<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> estimated that circumcising
      100 percent of the 1,822,910 born in 1971 would have cost 200
      million dollars. A lower figure is probably more accurate.
      With a physician's fee of $25 and an instrument fee of $15
      per case, the cost of circumcising 1,287,000 would be
      approximately 51 million dollars. <span class="c9">[CIRP
      note: The average cost of a non-therapeutic neonatal
      circumcision in the United States in 1998 is over US$200.00,
      so the total cost is over $200 million. <a
      href="/library/procedure/mansfield/">Mansfield <i>et
      al</i></a>. report that additional hospital costs add another
      $450 million in 1990 dollars.]</span></p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussing protection
      of the "medical commons" from "overgrazing" by medical
      practices of no value or of undetermined value, Hiatt<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> cited
      numerous procedures once widely practiced in the United
      States that have now virtually disappeared. Examples include
      colectomy for epilepsy, gastric freezing for peptic ulcer,
      wiring of aortic aneurysms, and renal capsule stripping for
      acute renal failure. Most such practices fell into disuse not
      because they were supplanted by better procedures but because
      they were eventually found to be of no medical value. Because
      they remained on the "medical commons" too long, valuable
      heath resources were squandered. Mass campaigns, such as
      wholesale circumcision, draw money and personnel away from
      other areas of medicine; if these other areas are more
      important, then the campaign has a negative effect on the
      public's health.<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where else might
      preventive health resources for newborn infants be directed?
      Immunization programs are health measures of established
      cost-effectiveness, yet vaccination rates are far too low.
      The application each year of thousands of medical personnel
      hours and 51 million dollars toward improving immunization
      rates for children would result in substantial health
      benefits. Screening newborn infants for phenylketonuria is
      another health program with a scientific foundation, clear
      objectives, measurable outcomes, and demonstrated
      cost-effectiveness. At a time when health care resources are
      limited and demands are great, investment each decade of half
      a billion dollars to trim foreskins appears injudicious.</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiatt<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> lamented
      that once a medical practice has been adopted and
      disseminated it is not quickly abandoned, even when it is
      shown to be of no benefit. When asked to comment on a medical
      practice of questionable benefit, however, Pritchard and
      associates<span class="c2"><sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup></span> responded emphatically that
      clinicians ought to use techniques only when certain that
      they do good; in clinical practice physicians should not have
      to prove that techniques are not dangerous. Commenting on the
      Australian Paediatric Society's resolution that newborn male
      infants should not routinely be circumcised, an editor<span
      class="c2"><sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup></span> observed
      that some subjects die hard, and of all the hardy perennials
      routine newborn circumcision is amongst the most
      stubborn.</p>

      <p class="c7">Comment</p>

      <p class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing literature
      is inadequate to evaluate appropriately routine circumcision
      of the newborn infant. On the basis of limited data, however,
      circumcision of neonates appears to lack sufficient
      justification. Potential benefits may include facilitation of
      hygiene and diminution in the risk of cancer of the penis.
      Lying outside the province of modern surgery, however, the
      procedure frequently features illogical bases for patient
      selection, neglect of the requirement to obtain informed
      consent, an inappropriate operator, needlessly radical
      technique, disregard for pain, dubious objectives, and
      unknown cost-effectiveness. Long-term randomized trials will
      be required to evaluate adequately newborn circumcision and
      its alternatives. However, until the benefits of routine
      circumcision of the neonate can be proved worth the risk and
      cost, medical resources probably should be allocated to
      measures of demonstrated value.</p>
