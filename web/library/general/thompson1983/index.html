      <p class="h1thom">The Value of Neonatal Circumcision</p>

      <p class="h2thom">An Unanswered and Perhaps Unanswerable
      Question</p>
      <br />

      <p class="text1"><span class="initthom">F</span>or almost two
      decades, there has been an ongoing dispute among physicians,
      particularly pediatricians, as to the justification for
      neonatal circumcision, especially on a &ldquo;routine&rdquo;
      basis. Neonatalogists have regarded the operation as without
      merit.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Physicians in all fields
      agree on the necessity for careful explanation to the
      parents, preferably before the infant is born. They deplore
      the occasional grave complications that are largely produced
      by poor technique and inexperienced operators. One major
      reason formerly used to justify neonatal
      circumcision&mdash;prevention or correction of
      phimosis&mdash;has been shown to be untenable by serial
      studies from birth to adulthood.</p>

      <p class="text2">The major indications now proposed as
      justifying the procedure are prevention of penile cancer and
      balanitis and a reduction in herpes genitalis and, possibly,
      cancer of the uterine cervix. These diseases are decades
      removed from the neonatal period, and opponents of
      circumcision regarding them as lacking incontrovertible proof
      or as inconsequential. They say that inadequate hygiene would
      serve as well as circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">On the other hand, proponents say that risks
      to the infant can be almost eliminated by recognition of
      contraindications and good technique by well-trained
      operators. They say adequate lifelong penile hygiene is
      unlikely in large sections of the population, especially
      since one study found that 50 of 69 14 to 15-year-old
      uncircumcised British schoolboys with totally retractable
      foreskins practiced no hygiene.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
      Furthermore, in populations where hygiene is poor, cancer of
      the penis is a common male malignant neoplasm.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> While this cancer is rare in the
      United States, patients often do not seek help until the
      disease is well advanced and devastating in its
      effect.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> Estimates of the
      relative frequency of deaths caused by cancer of the penis
      and neonatal circumcision vary from 200 caused by cancer to
      one caused by circumcision in Australia<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> to the subsequently retracted
      statement that there are more deaths caused by circumcision
      complications than cancer of the penis.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The increased incidence of uncircumcised men
      among Canadian Army recruits with venereal disease (VD) in
      1947,<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> as well as the earlier
      requirement of the US Navy that their personnel be
      circumcised, shows that the incidence of VD was indeed
      greater among uncircumcised men. This indication was thought
      to be long outmoded until the frequency of herpes genitalis
      infection was recognized. In a British study, the occurrence
      of herpes was found to be greater among uncircumcised
      men.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> Certainly, this question
      is still not definitely answered, nor is the possibility that
      cancer of the uterine cervix is more common among
      uncircumcised men. The investigators of a recent study, which
      failed to show a statistical significance among 1,148
      patients with cervical cancer whose husbands were physically
      examined, concluded that the role of circumcision in the
      epidemiology of cancer of the cervix remains uncertain and
      that further carefully controlled studies are needed.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Historically, the critical attention of
      physicians caring for newborns was directed toward
      circumcision at a time when that procedure and exchange
      tranfusion were the only services to newborns paid for by
      certain Blue Shield plans. The obvious injustice of this
      rankled, as the value of circumcision seemed questionable,
      and sophicated care of premature infants was emerging. In an
      attempt to provide an objective answer after the American
      Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Fetus and Newborn
      had stated, &ldquo;There is no medical indication for
      circumcision in the neonatal period,&rdquo;<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> the AAP appointed an ad hoc committee
      consisting of a neonatalogist, a pediatric urologist, an
      obstretrician, and this author (H.C.T). <span
      class="yellow">The ad hoc committee was sharply divided in
      its opinions, and the resulting statement was a
      compromise</span> that stated there was &ldquo;no
      <i>absolute</i> indication for <i>routine</i> circumcision of
      the newborn.&rdquo;,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup>
      The words <i>absolute</i> and <i>routine</i> were meant to
      convey a different impression from the conclusion of the AAP
      Committee on the Fetus and Newborn, but this has not always
      been the interpretation of readers.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The argument continues
      to rage</span>, and there are at least 100 listings on
      circumcision from the English-speaking literature referenced
      in the <i>Index Medicus</i> from 1975 through 1982. The
      journal <i>Pediatrics</i> alone accounted for 19. Some are
      case reports of serious complications. Others are statements
      of personal convictions, <span class="yellow">some with
      emotional overtones.</span> There are a few careful studies
      and several review articles. They are in obstetric, surgical,
      urologic, psychiatric, family practice, and nursing journals
      and from at least eight countries.</p>

      <p class="text2">What should be the posture of pediatricians
      at this time, especially since the physician&rsquo;s attitude
      could be a major factor in parental decisions? First,
      neonatal circumcision is not a routine procedure to be
      accomplished on all newborns. If performed, it should be
      preceded by careful explanation to the parents of both the
      pros and cons. Adequate lifelong penile hygiene should be
      defined. The value of such counseling is, however,
      dubious.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> To reduce risks to a
      minimum, the procedure should be performed on stabilized
      normal infants with meticulous surgical technique by well
      trained personnel.</p>

      <p class="text2">In 1983, it is impossible to say how great
      or little is the value of neonatal circumcision over the
      entire period of a man&rsquo;s life. A well-documented
      article by Warner and Strashin<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> reviews in detail many aspects of
      the subject. If it is not performed, it is variously
      estimated that 5% to 10% of males will subsequently need
      circumcision when the risks, costs, and emotional trauma will
      be much greater.<sup><a href="#n12">12,13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">To determine definitely the prophylactic
      value of neonatal circumcision would require large
      prospective studies throughout decades in several countries
      with different climates and involving all
      socioeconomic-educational strata. The multiple variables
      encountered might well prevent valid conclusions, even if the
      heavy expertise and longtime commitment of investigators
      could be obtained. It may well be that, depending on climate,
      nationality, and education, neonatal circumcision will be of
      great value in certain populations and unnecessary for
      others. Physicians have always had to deal with these
      uncertainties. Pediatricians will rarely see the diseases
      that are, or may be, more common in the uncircumcised.
      Therefore, they must try to maintain their objectivity and
      admit that they do not know the definitive answers.</p>
