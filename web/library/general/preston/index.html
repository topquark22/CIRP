          <p class="abstract"><font size="4"><i>Routine neonatal
          circumcision has been advocated as a means of preventing
          genitourinary diseases and genital cancers. However, the
          procedure has been found to have been of questionable
          benefit and to be associated with both immediate and
          delayed risks and complications. These in turn may
          produce undesirable psychologic, sexual, and medico-legal
          difficulties. Circumcision is considered with respect to
          carcinoma of the cervix, penis, and prostate; there is
          little evidence that circumcision of the newborn affords
          protection against subsequent development of these
          cancers in individuals who practice good personal
          hygiene.</i></font></p>

          also published in 1970, disproved the false claim by
          Abraham Wolbarst that male circumcision could prevent
          penile cancer. Its publication influenced the American
          Academy of Pediatrics which issued a <a

          following year that said "there are no valid medical

        <p align="justify"><font size="7">C</font>ircumcision of
        the newborn has been recommended to prevent the occurrence
        of various disorders such as phimosis. paraphimosis, and
        balanoposthitis,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> venereal
        diseases including lymphogranuloma venereum, syphilitic
        chancres, and herpes progenitalis,<sup><a
        href="#n2">2</a></sup> as well as carcinoma of the
        cervix<sup><a href="#n3">3,4</a></sup> penis,<sup><a
        href="#n2">2,5</a></sup> and prostate.<sup><a
        href="#n3">3,8</a></sup> Routine circumcision of the
        newborn has been recommended to avoid emotional distress in
        the only uncircumcised boy in a high-school locker room or
        summer camp,<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> and to avoid
        psychologic, anesthetic, and surgical risks if it is
        performed at a later age.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup>
        Additionally circumcision has been advocated on the grounds
        that the circumcised phallus is cleaner,<sup><a
        href="#n2">2,5,11</a></sup> that it provides greater
        pleasure during sexual intercourse,<sup><a
        href="#n12">12,13</a></sup> and that it is more esthetic.
        Goodwin<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> has observed that,
        "circumcision is a beautification comparable to
        rhinoplasty, and a circumcised penis appears in its flaccid
        state as an erect uncircumcised organ - a beautiful
        instrument of precise intent."</p>

        <p class="2">Arguments against circumcision include the
        views that, like any other surgical operation, it is
        associated with certain infrequent but preventable hazards
        and complications and basically the operation is
        unnecessary.</p>

        <p class="topic"><b>Complications</b></p>

        <p class="2">Complications of circumcision may be regarded
        as immediate or delayed. The immediate complications fall
        into three categories: hemorrhage, infection, and surgical
        trauma.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup> Hemorrhage is the
        most common of these immediate complications. It may be
        caused by inadequate hemostasis, blood coagulapathies, or
        the existence of anomalous vessels.<sup><a
        href="#n15">15</a></sup> Patel<sup><a
        href="#n16">16</a></sup> studied 100 consecutive male
        infants who were circumcised at birth and who were
        reevaluated 6 to 18 months later. He found 35 instances of
        hemorrhage of which four required sutures.</p>

        <p class="2">Infection of the wound in circumcision is also
        a fairly common complication. It is manifested by local
        inflammatory changes, ulceration, and suppuration.<sup><a
        href="#n15">15</a></sup> Occasionally infection may lead to
        more serious complications such as partial necrosis of the
        penis, or it may be a source of septicemia. Shulman et
        al<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> have recorded a case of
        staphylococcal septicemia giving rise to osteomyletis of
        the femur, and a fatal case of septicemia and pulmonary
        abscesses, both of which were ascribed to infection of
        circumcision wounds.</p>

        <p class="2">A common complication of circumcision is loss
        of penile skin. This can result from pulling too much of
        the skin from the shaft up over the glans during the
        operation. The remaining skin slides back, leaving a
        denuded penile shaft. Major losses of penile skin usually
        occur, however, because of a complicating infection, the
        use of the electocautery, or improper surgical technique.
        Van Duyn and Warr<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> reported
        a case of routine circumcision, performed by an
        experienced, competent pediatrician with use of a
        circumcision clamp, that resulted in wound dehiscence and
        required replacement by split skin grafting.</p>

        <p class="2">Additional complications include accidental
        lacerations of penile or scrotal skin, or both, incomplete
        circumcision with formation of adhesions and secondary
        penile deformity, and accidental amputation of the glans
        with secondary postoperative hemorrhage, and retraction of
        the penis into a subcutaneous position by contraction,
        healing, and fibrosis of the circular wound.<sup><a
        href="#n1">1,15,18</a></sup></p>

        <p class="2">Delayed complications of circumcision are
        related to the newly circumcised penis being in frequent
        and prolonged contact with feces and ammoniacal urine. One
        could logically expect the de-epitheialized, edematous,
        bleeding glans to become inflamed, bruised, or infected,
        with subsequent development of fibrosis and scarring.</p>

        <p class="2">Meatal stenosis, with its symptoms of dysuria,
        increased urinary frequency, and enuresis, is not related
        either to the method of circumcision or to the skill with
        which it is performed as it is a late complication.<sup><a
        href="#n1">1</a></sup> The appearance of this condition
        indicates the fallacy of the argument that boys should be
        circumcised at birth so they will have "no trouble in later
        life." In Patel's series of 100 newborn circumcised boys
        who were examined 6 to 18 months later, 31 had developed
        meatal ulcers, 8 had meatal stenosis, 1 had phimosis (!)
        and 8 developed infections.</p>

        <p class="2">Delayed complications of circumcisions may not
        only be anatomic; they may also be psychologic.
        Settlage<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> has stated,
        "Concern for the psychologic development and future health
        of the child requires that events in the neonatal as well
        as any later stage of development be managed in such as a
        way as to keep tension in the child within tolerable
        limits." One cannot argue that structure and functions are
        intimately related, and at the same time shrug off with
        equanimity the fretful, circumcised newborn, his glans
        swollen and cyanotic for three to five days.</p>

        <p class="topic"><b>Is Circumcision Necessary?</b></p>

        <p class="2">It is interesting to note that all of the
        reasons advanced for routine circumcision have to do the
        prevention of certain conditions, not with the
        establishment of a condition such as strong teeth and bones
        or a normal cardiac reserve. Robertson<sup><a
        href="#n20">20</a></sup> has stated: Avoidance of harm is
        not to be equated with provision of benefit; just because
        it doesn't kill, that doesn't mean it helps."</p>

        <p class="2">One of the reasons advanced for routine
        neonatal circumcision is the prevention of phimosis.
        Actually the presence of phimosis cannot be determined at
        birth because histologically the prepuce is still
        developing at this time and its separation is usually
        incomplete.<sup><a href="#n18">18,21</a></sup> McKay<sup><a
        href="#n22">22</a></sup> has observed: "The prepuce of the
        newborn infant is normally so tight and adherent that no
        information can be obtained as to later need for
        circumcision.</p>

        <p class="2">At birth only 4% of boys have a fully
        retractable foreskin; ; at 6 months of age, 15%; at one
        year of age 50%, and it is not until the age of 3 that 90%
        of boys have a completely retractable prepuce.<sup><a
        href="#n23">23</a></sup> To diagnose phimosis one must find
        not only a nonretractable foreskin, but a small preputial
        opening. "Ballooning" of the prepuce occurs on micturation.
        <font color="navy"><b>[CIRP Note: Ballooning is now
        regarded as a <a href="/library/normal/">normal stage of
        development</a> and not an indication of a need for
        circumcision.]</b></font></p>

        <p class="2">Recurrent infection under a non-retractable
        foreskin in an older child seems a more legitimate reason
        for recommending operation to allow drainage. The fortunate
        rarity of this condition is possibly the result of the
        persisting attachment of the prepuce to the glans.<sup><a
        href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

        <p class="2">Balanitis is uncommon in childhood when the
        prepuce is performing its protective function; in the
        circumcised penis the incidence of meatal ulcers is
        significantly increased precisely because the glans is
        deprived of the protection of the foreskin.<sup><a
        href="#n1">1,18,21,24</a></sup> Most cases described as
        balanitis are nothing more than inflammation of the skin of
        the prepuce, which is usually due to ammonia dermititis
        from ammoniacal urine and circumcision is strongly
        contraindicated. In these cases the foreskin is carrying
        out its prime function of protecting the underlying
        glans;<sup><a href="#n1">1,12,18,21,24,25</a></sup> if it
        is removed, a meatal ulcer due to the ammonia will almost
        certainly result.<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup></p>

        <p class="2">As to the argument that circumcision is of
        value in preventing the accumulation of venereal disease,
        Morgan<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup> has observed:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="quote">Venereal disease is more prevalent in
            the lower socioeconomic groups and these are the groups
            that are most likely to be uncircumcised. They are also
            the groups in which there is a poor standard of
            personal hygiene. The lower socioeconomic groups are
            also those with a higher incidence of tuberculosis but
            one could be excused for doubting that the retention of
            the prepuce renders one more susceptible to
            tuberculosis. Post hoc ergo propter hoc is invalid
            logic.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="2">Herskowitz<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> has
        noted that Spock's<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> argument
        that circumcision helps a boy to feel "regular" is
        cultural, and wonders if Spock would favor circumcision of
        the clitoris in a society where that is the usual practice.
        It is the duty of the medical profession to lead rather
        than follow a community's standards of health care. <font
        color="navy"><b>[CIRP note: Dr. Benjamin Spock later
        changed his mind and came to oppose
        circumcision.]</b></font></p>

        <p class="2">Different opinions exist as to the importance
        of the foreskin in the act of coitus. On the one hand is
        Morgan's<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> assertion that
        coitus without a foreskin is comparable to viewing a Renoir
        while colorblind due to the prepuce lubricating the glans
        and permitting easier penetration. On the other is the
        statement that after circumcision the glans becomes less
        sensitive, resulting in a more delayed orgasm, and this a
        lessening of premature ejaculation. Goodwin<sup><a
        href="#n13">13</a></sup> quoted a patient discussing
        delayed orgasm as prostatectomy as saying, "It takes about
        15 minutes longer, doctor, but we don't begrudge a moment
        of it."</p>

        <p class="2">As to the argument that the circumcised penis
        is more esthetic, one is reminded that beauty is in the eye
        of the beholder, and that most Renaissance works of are
        show the male organ, if not with a fig leaf, at least with
        a foreskin. Morgan<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup>
        noted:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="quote">Perhaps why American mothers seem to
            endorse the operation with such enthusiasm is the fact
            that it is one way an intensely matriarchal society can
            permanently influence the physical characteristics of
            its males,</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>

        <p>and concluded:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="quote">the argument is also put forth that
            the circumcised organ is more hygienic for the prepuce
            collects nasty secretions. So does the ear, but the
            removal of this rather ugly appendage is frowned upon,
            and in one famous instance cutting it off lead to war -
            the so-called war of Captain Jenkin's ear. One can be
            grateful that this worthy mariner did not lose his
            prepuce under similar circumstances, for it is rather
            likely the battle would still be raging.<sup><a
            href="#n18">18</a></sup></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="2"><font color="navy"><b>[CIRP note: There now
        follows a discussion of cancer of the cervix. Later
        research has established the role of the human
        papillomavirus (HPV) and smoking in the etiology of cancer
        of the cervix. The foreskin is no longer believed to cause
        cancer.]</b></font></p>

        <p class="topic"><b>Circumcision and Cancer of the
        Cervix</b></p>

        <p class="2">Circumcision is only one of a large number of
        variables, many of them interrelated, which cannot be
        considered separately in epidemiologic studies of the
        etiology of cancer of the cervix. Factors known to be
        associated with a high degree of risk of developing
        cervical cancer include low socioeconomic status, early
        marriage, multiple marriages, extramarital relations,
        coitus at an early age, nonuse of contraceptives, syphilis,
        and multiparity.<sup><a href="#n28">28</a></sup></p>

        <p class="2">In 1932, Hanley<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>
        found only three cases of cancer among 90,000 Fijians who
        practice male circumcision at birth, but he found 26 cases
        among 70,000 Hindus who do not practice circumcision. The
        two populations live side by side but do not
        intermingle.</p>

        <p class="2">New data<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> from
        Fiji 25 years later, however indicated that natives of Fiji
        have a lower incidence of cancer in general, whereas the
        immigrant Hindus have a much higher incidence of cancer of
        all sorts. Also, while nearly 100% of the Fijians were
        circumcised in contrast to only 25% of the Hindus, there
        were 55 cases of the former with cancer of the cervix and
        only 101 of the latter, a ratio of 1:2 instead of the 1:9
        of 25 years earlier. Perhaps this reflects improved methods
        on cancer detection developed over the intervening years,
        but in any case the data no longer retain their original
        significance.</p>

        <p class="2">Circumcision probably improves the hygienic
        status of the penis in circumstances where a low standard
        of hygiene would otherwise prevail. Kmet's<sup><a
        href="#n30">30</a></sup> group studied circumcised orthodox
        Moslems, circumcised "emancipated" Moslems, and
        uncircumcised non-Moslems in Yugoslavia. They found
        premalignant lesions of the cervix to be 11 per 1,000 in
        the uncircumcised non-Moslems, 5.5 per 1,000 in the
        circumcised emancipated Moslems, and nil in the circumcised
        orthodox Moslems. This would indicate circumcision to be of
        questionable benefit in protecting women who live in
        cultures not adhering to religious rules regarding sexual
        hygiene, promiscuity, and genital cleanliness. A possible
        weakness in Kmet's study is that they were unable to obtain
        any data regarding the percent distribution of the
        circumcised males or the types of prepuces present in the
        uncircumcised.</p>

        <p class="2">Aitken-Swan and Baird's<sup><a
        href="#n31">31</a></sup> group of 54 husbands whose wives
        had pre-clinical and clinical cancer of the cervix included
        12 who were completely and 10 who were partly circumcised,
        compared with 56 husbands whose wives were in a control
        group, of whom 14 were completely and 14 partly
        circumcised. Thus complete circumcision was found about as
        frequently in husbands of patients with cancer as in
        husbands of controls.</p>

        <p class="2">Boyd and Doll<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup>
        found the discovery rate for cancer of the cervix among
        non-Jewish women whose marital partners were circumcised to
        be no different from the rate among non-Jewish women with
        circumcised husbands. Jones et al<sup><a
        href="#n33">33</a></sup> found the incidence of cancer of
        the cervix not to be related to the absence of circumcision
        in the spouse or other sexual partners. Circumcision was as
        common among the husbands of a group of women with certain
        cervical cancer as among husbands of a control group of
        women.</p>

        <p class="2">Khanolkar<sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup>
        found the cervix to be the site of origin of cancer more
        frequently in Moslem than in Parsee women with cancer,
        although the husbands of the former are circumcised and the
        those of the latter are not. The Parsees on the other hand,
        attach much greater importance to cleanliness.
        Additionally, Elliot<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup> found
        English wives at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale
        to have a liability to cancer of the cervix more than ten
        times greater than those at the top.</p>

        <p class="2">Lack of circumcision supposedly leads to the
        accumulation of smegma beneath the prepuce<sup><a
        href="#n5">5,6</a></sup> and smegma has been thought to be
        a carcinogenic substance.<sup><a href="#n2">2,6</a></sup>
        If this were the case one would expect to find a difference
        in the rate of discovery of malignant and premalignant
        lesions of the cervix between groups not using such an
        obstructive form.</p>

        <p class="2">In support of such a theory, Boyd and
        Doll<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup> found that fewer
        patients than controls had used obstructive methods of
        contraception, and Baird and Aitken-Swan<sup><a
        href="#n31">31</a></sup> found that fewer patients than
        controls had "ever used" or "predominantly used" a sheath
        or cap contraceptive. Of 54 patients with cancer of the
        cervix, 13% had used an obstructive contraceptive as
        opposed to 43% of 56 controls. Stern and Nealy,<sup><a
        href="#n36">36</a></sup> however discovered that the use of
        a sheath contraceptive by the marital partner was not to be
        associated with rate differences for cancer of the cervix
        between patient and control groups.</p>

        <p class="2">To determine whether smegma is indeed
        carcinogenic, Heins, in a study reported by Weiss,<sup><a
        href="#n29">29</a></sup> inoculated monkeys through the
        vagina one to two times weekly for three years with raw
        human smegma and was unable to produce any cancers of the
        cervix or vagina. Additionally, Fishman's<sup><a
        href="#n37">37</a></sup> group injected smegma from old men
        into the vaginas of mice two to three times weekly for 12
        months and was unable to stimulate the production of
        genital cancers, although inoculation of similar animals
        with a known carcinogen regularly produced vaginal
        cancers.</p>

        <p class="2">Dodge's<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup>
        investigations in Kenya have revealed not significant
        differences between the numbers of cervical cancer cases in
        women of tribe who men were or were not circumcised. He
        concluded: "The tribal distribution of cases does not seem
        in any way related to the practice of circumcision among
        the tribal males . . . thus it seems the role of smegma in
        the genesis of cervical cancer is of little
        importance."<sup><a href="#n35">35</a></sup></p>

        <p class="2">Lack of circumcision as a possible etiology
        for cancer of the cervix received attention from
        Gagnon's<sup><a href="#n39">39</a></sup> being unable to
        find a single case of cervical carcinoma among 13,000
        Catholic nuns over a 20-year period. This has lead to the
        idea that since Catholic nuns do not have intercourse with
        uncircumcised men, a lower rate of cervical cancer would
        obtain in those cultures where circumcision is
        performed.</p>

        <p class="2">Seemingly overlooked is the idea that Catholic
        nuns do not have intercourse with circumcised men either.
        It would appear that the decisive factor in the nuns'
        freedom from cervical cancer is related not to the presence
        or absence of the foreskin but to the absence of sexual
        relations.</p>

        <p class="2">In 1964, Reid<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup>
        suggested that penetration of the epithelium by spermatozoa
        could initiate the process leading to cancer, and that an
        obstructive contraceptive would lessen the cancer risk by
        preventing spermatozoa from reaching the squamous
        epithelium. Boyd and Doll's<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup>
        and Baird and Aitken-Swans<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup>
        findings in this regard and Gagnon's<sup><a
        href="#n39">39</a></sup> data from the Catholic nuns would
        seem to support this proposal.</p>

        <p class="topic"><b>Circumcision and Carcinoma of the
        Penis</b></p>

        <p class="2">Lack of circumcision has been found to be
        associated with carcinoma of the penis. Many authors<sup><a
        href="#n2">2,3,5-7</a></sup> have noted the rarity of
        penile cancers in circumcised men. Dodge and Kaviti<sup><a
        href="#n7">7</a></sup> have stated that cancer of the penis
        occurs more frequently among European an Asian populations
        in the uncircumcised than among the circumcised.
        Others<sup><a href="#n2">2,3</a></sup> have claimed that
        cancer of the penis has never been recorded in men
        circumcised at birth.</p>

        <p class="2">But, does the retention of the foreskin truly
        cause cancer of the penis? Is smegma actually carcinogenic?
        Or does the accumulation of smegma beneath the prepuce
        indicate a more basic problem, namely, that of poor genital
        hygiene? Proponents of circumcision have been unable to
        answer these questions with certainty.</p>

        <p class="2">In 1960, Apt<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup>
        found only 15 cases of cancer of the penis, scrotum and
        other male genital organs (excluding cancer of the prostate
        and testis) in Sweden. Practically all of Sweden's 3.7
        million males are not circumcised.</p>

        <p class="2">Anna-Munthrodo<sup><a href="#n41">41</a></sup>
        recorded the incidence of carcinoma of the penis amongst
        Jamaicans and observed that 50% of them had gonococcal
        infection, 55% had positive blood Wassermann reactions, and
        50% of them had positive complement-fixation tests for
        granuloma inguinale.</p>

        <p class="2">The Javanese, like the Jews, regularly perform
        ritual circumcision, but Sampoerno, in a study referred to
        by Herskowitz,<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> found seven
        carcinomas of the penis among 78 carcinomas of Javanese
        men.</p>

        <p class="2">Additionally, all 163 cases with cancer of the
        penis in Reddy's<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> series of
        Indian men belonged to the low-income group who are usually
        credited with low personal and genital hygiene. Dodge and
        Kaviti<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> found the rate of
        carcinoma of the penis among uncircumcised east African
        tribes to vary considerably and conceded that unexplored
        differences in personal hygiene or in dietary habits may be
        responsible. Lenowitz and Graham<sup><a
        href="#n42">42</a></sup> found in 1946 that cancer of the
        penis was 5 times more common in American Negroes than in
        American whites, but skin cancer was seven times more
        common in whites.</p>

        <p class="2">The facts speak for themselves. Carcinoma of
        the penis is uncommon in uncircumcised men with a high
        standard of hygiene, as in Sweden, but circumcision affords
        little protection in populations where personal hygiene may
        be minimal. In cases of penile carcinoma, lack of hygiene
        is always striking.<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup> If the
        uncircumcised man has a foreskin which he can retract and
        which he keeps clean, the risk of this cancer is
        removed.</p>

        <p class="topic"><b>Circumcision and Carcinoma of the
        Prostate</b></p>

        <p class="2">Some investigators<sup><a
        href="#n3">3,6</a></sup> have attempted to show a
        correlation between uncircumcision and prostatic
        carcinoma.</p>

        <p class="2">Ravich<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> found
        that among his 1,275 Jewish private patients who underwent
        surgery for prostatic obstruction there were only 23 with
        cancer, an incidence of 1.8%. This compared with 35
        cancers, or 19% in the 132 non-Jewish private patients, of
        whom he estimated "about" 5% were circumcised.
        Unfortunately, there are no data as to the age differences
        of his Jewish vs. non-Jewish patients. Since prostatic
        cancer is a disease associated with advanced age, the
        omission of this information renders his data
        inconclusive.</p>

        <p class="2">Interestingly, Ravich<sup><a
        href="#n3">3</a></sup> also noted there was a 67% incidence
        of prior venereal infections in patients with cancer of the
        prostate as compared with 28% of the benign prostatic
        cases. He found that the incidence of cancer was
        significantly higher in both male Jews and non-Jews when
        gonorrhea had been present. This in turn would indicate a
        lower state of personal hygiene in prostatic cancer than in
        benign cases.</p>

        <p class="2">Apt<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> studied the
        cancer registers of Sweden and Israel for 1960 and found
        the number of prostatic cancers cases in Sweden to be 1,544
        as opposed to 88 in Israel. This indicated the annual rate
        in Sweden to be 414 per million males in comparison to
        Israel's 88. Thus he concluded prostatic cancer to be 4.7
        times more frequent in Sweden than in Israel. But, there
        were 3.7 million males in Sweden in 1960 and only 1.0
        million males in Israel. Also, using Apt's own figures, 16%
        of the male population of Sweden was over 60 years old, as
        opposed to 8.3% of the Israeli male population being 60 or
        more years old. If one takes 16% of 3.7 million males, he
        finds that there were 0.592 million males over age 60 in
        Sweden. Taking 8.3% of 1.0 million males, one finds 0.083
        million males over age 60 in Israel. There are thus seven
        times more men over age 60 in Sweden than in Israel, but
        prostatic cancer is only 4.7 times more frequent in Sweden.
        Would this mean that non-circumcision protects against
        prostatic cancer?</p>

        <p class="topic"><b>Comment</b></p>

        <p class="2">Circumcision is rarely performed or requested
        on the basis of its medical indications. Shaw and
        Robertson<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup> interviewed 80
        mothers of newborn male infants and found that 72% denied
        that a physician had ever discussed circumcision with them.
        The reasons for or against circumcision stated by 106
        physicians questioned bore little of any resemblance to the
        reasons advanced by the 80 mothers. The results cast doubt
        on the belief that the decision to circumcise is reached in
        any scientific manner. Obviously, circumcision performed on
        the basis of religious beliefs is beyond the scope of this
        discussion.</p>

        <p class="2">Poor sexual hygiene, inadequate hygienic
        facilities, and venereal disease tend to increase the
        incidence of genitourinary cancers in ethnic groups or
        populations that do not practice circumcision. In these
        groups, then, circumcision would seem to be indicated.</p>

        <p class="2">However in groups where a high standard of
        cleanliness could reasonably be expected, circumcision at
        birth would not seem to be justified. Certainly phimosis,
        paraphimosis, balanoposthitis, and penile carcinoma are
        uncommon and could probably be prevented by adequate
        hygiene. It seems more likely that the presence of smegma
        in the uncircumcised is simply a sign of poor hygiene, and
        that this is the risk factor which increases the risk of
        both penile and cervical cancer.<sup><a
        href="#n28">28</a></sup></p>

        <p class="2">Proponents of circumcision will agree that in
        theory, personal hygiene may be as effective as
        circumcision in cancer prevention. The critical point
        however, is whether the necessary standards are, or can be
        achieved in practice. Newhill<sup><a
        href="#n11">11</a></sup> has stated, "An uncircumcised boy
        has to be taught to keep his penis clean - which is likely
        to result in an undesirable concentration of attention on
        his penis every time he has a bath. A penis without a
        prepuce is permanently clean."</p>

        <p class="2">There is no question but that cleanliness must
        be taught. However, if a child can be taught to tie his
        shoes or brush his teeth or wash behind his ears, he can
        also be taught to wash beneath his foreskin. The foreskin
        is not fully retractable in 90% of males before age 3
        anyway and not special attention is needed before this
        time. As to the boy paying an undesirable amount of
        attention to the genital area, most children in the genital
        stage of development will do exactly that. Children will
        play with themselves and with each other. Mere circumcision
        will not prevent such activity, nor is it supposed to.</p>

        <p class="2">In regard to the immediate surgical
        complications of circumcision, it is true that their
        incidence is small. They do however exist, and they are
        preventable. Such potential hazards as uncontrollable
        hemorrhage, lacerations, deformities, and amputations
        should be considered not only from the patient's and
        family's points of view but from a medico-legal one as
        well.Delayed complications of circumcision are more common,
        but less severe. Meatal ulcer, meatal stenosis, enuresis,
        and penile deformity secondary to scarring and fibrosis are
        potential sequelae of circumcision.</p>

        <p class="2">Justification of circumcision in order to save
        a boy later lockerroom embarrassment seems unrealistic.
        This is the latter half of the 20th century, a time
        supposedly to celebrate individuality and freedom of
        choice. One of the American ideals is independence and
        originality of expression. If being uncircumcised is
        embarrassing to a boy he can always be circumcised later.
        At any rate it will be his choice, and he will know why he
        chooses it.</p>

        <p class="2">Finally, to those physicians who would
        recommend the performance of untold numbers of
        circumcisions to prevent one case of cancer of the penis,
        there arises an interesting problem: The ultimate side
        effects and complications of the orally administered
        contraceptives have yet to be determined, but how many
        physicians who advocate circumcision as a cancer
        preventative continue to prescribe these anovulatory
        agents? How many of them still allow their patients, their
        wives or their children to smoke cigarettes, which are far
        more likely to be carcinogenic than is the foreskin?</p>

        <p class="2">Radiation of the thymus and routine
        tonsillectomy are no longer acceptable. This is because
        they have been found to be associated with certain dangers
        and to provide only questionable benefits. Perhaps routine
        neonatal circumcision will one day join these antiquated
        curiosities in medicine's attic.</p>

        <p class="topic"><b>Conclusion</b></p>

        <p class="2"><span class="yellow">Routine circumcision of
        the newborn is an unnecessary procedure. It provides
        questionable benefits and is associated with a small but
        definite incidence of complications and hazards. These
        risks are preventable if the operation is not performed
        unless truly medically indicated. Circumcision of the
        newborn is a procedure that should no longer be considered
        routine.</span></p>
