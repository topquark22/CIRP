      <p class="text1"><span class="sum">Summary:</span> The
      results from a telephone survey in 2001&ndash;02 of a
      probability sample of Australian households including 10,173
      men aged 16&ndash;59 (response rate 69.4%) are used to assess
      the prevalence of circumcision across social groups in
      Australia and examine lifetime history of sexually
      transmissible infection (STI), sexual difficulties in the
      last year, sexual practices including masturbation, and
      sexual attitudes.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half (59%) of the men were
      circumcised. Circumcision was less common among younger men
      (32% aged &lt;20) and more common among the Australian born
      (69%). After correction for age, circumcision was unrelated
      to reporting STI, but appeared to protect against penile
      candidiasis. Circumcision was unrelated to most sexual
      difficulties, but circumcised men were less likely to report
      physical pain during intercourse or trouble keeping an
      erection; reasons for this are unknown. There were no
      significant differences in practices at last sexual encounter
      with a female partner or in masturbation alone. Circumcised
      men had somewhat more liberal sexual attitudes.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neonatal circumcision was routine in
      Australia until the 1970s. It appears not to be associated
      with significant protective or harmful sexual health
      outcomes. This study provides no evidence about the effects
      on sexual sensitivity.</p>

      <p class="section">Introduction</p>

      <p class="text1">In the last generation, Australia has
      changed from a country where most newborn boys are
      circumcised to one where circumcision is the minority
      experience. This change has been led largely by medical
      service providers, influenced by economic, legal, human
      rights and health service considerations. New evidence about
      the lower risk of HIV acquisition by circumcised men in
      developing countries has re-opened the debate both in medical
      settings and in the popular media.</p>

      <p class="text2">In this paper we examine data from a
      national survey to answer five questions:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>What is the prevalence of circumcision among Australian
        men, and how does it vary by age and other demographic
        factors?</li>

        <li>Are circumcised men more or less likely to have
        experience of sexually transmissible infection (STIs)?</li>

        <li>Are circumcised men more or less likely to have
        experienced sexual difficulties in the previous year?</li>

        <li>Does the sexual repertoire of circumcised men differ
        from that of uncircumcised men?</li>

        <li>Do circumcised men differ in their sexual attitudes
        from uncircumcised men?</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="text2">Previous estimates of the age-related
      prevalence of circumcision in Australia have been based on
      health service or insurance statistics (i.e. incidence, not
      prevalence); one analysis showed a drop over the 1970s from
      about 50% to 40% of newborn boys circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> A study in Western Australia found
      that in the 1980s and 1990s less than 10% of babies were
      circumcised.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> The same authors
      show that as the Medicare public health insurance system no
      longer covers routine neonatal circumcision, medical
      indications such as phimosis are reported more
      frequently.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> Current advice to
      parents from the Paediatrics and Child Health Division of the
      Royal Australasian College of Physicians is based on a review
      and policy statement that concludes that &lsquo;there is no
      medical indication for routine male
      circumcision&rsquo;.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> Parents
      may be given a leaflet summarizing the pro and con positions
      and allowed to make the decision themselves.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">There is some evidence that uncircumcised
      men may be more prone to STIs, particularly ulcerative
      disease.<sup><a href="#n7">7&ndash;9</a></sup> However,
      recent evidence that this is the case in developed countries
      is comparatively sparse. The United States National Health
      and Social Life Survey (NHSLS) found no protective effect of
      circumcision.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> Nor did the
      2000 British National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and
      Lifestyles.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup> No previous
      population-based studies in Australia have examined the
      relationship between circumcision status and STI history. A
      study in a Sydney sexual health clinic concluded that
      circumcision had no significant effect on the incidence of
      common STIs, but the authors remarked that this finding might
      not extend to other settings with poorer hygiene and a
      different spectrum of infections.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Opinions are mixed on the effects of
      circumcision on sexual function and pleasure. It is often
      suggested that although circumcision may make the glans penis
      less sensitive to superficial touch because of the
      keratinization of the epithelium, circumcised men have a
      sexual benefit from this loss of sensitivity because they can
      &lsquo;last longer&rsquo; during intercourse.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6,13</a></sup> The NHSLS did not find a difference
      between circumcised and uncircumcised men in whether they
      reached orgasm too quickly.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup>
      The study did find, however, that older uncircumcised men
      were more likely to have trouble with achieving or
      maintaining an erection.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the 19th century, circumcision was
      sometimes recommended as a preventive against masturbation,
      or perhaps a punishment for it.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14,15</a></sup> However, the NHSLS found that
      circumcised men were more likely to masturbate. Circumcised
      men were more likely to be white and well educated, and had a
      wider sexual repertoire.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

        <p class="text3">STDs<br />
         The following questions are about sexual health. Not all
        the questions are about sexually transmissible
        diseases.<br />
         Have you ever had any of the following? I will read out a
        list, and ask you to say yes or no to each one.<br />
         Pubic lice or crabs?<br />
         Genital warts? (Includes anal warts if he asks.)<br />
         Chlamydia?<br />
         Genital herpes?<br />
         Syphilis?<br />
         Gonorrhoea?<br />
         Non-specific urethritis or NSU?<br />

         Penile candida or thrush?</p>

        <p class="text3">Masturbation<br />
         In the last 12 months, have you ever masturbated alone?
        (Prompt if necessary: stimulated yourself.)<br />
         Sexual practices at last encounter with a female
        partner<br />
         The last time you had sex, did you put your penis into her
        vagina?<br />
         The last time you had sex, did you put your penis into her
        anus?<br />
         The last time you had sex, did you have oral sex with your
        mouth on her vaginal area?<br />
         The last time you had sex, did you have oral sex with her
        mouth on your penis?<br />
         Did you stimulate her clitoris or vaginal area with your
        hand?<br />
         Did she stimulate your penis with her hand?<br />
         And the last time you had sex with her, did you have an
        orgasm?</p>

        <p class="text3">Sexual difficulties<br />
         The next questions are about your sexual life now.<br />
         During the last year has there been a period of one month
        or more when you lacked interest in having sex?<br />
         Has there been a period of one month or more when you were
        unable to come to orgasm (a climax)?<br />
         Has there been a period of one month or more when you came
        to orgasm (a climax) too quickly?<br />
         Has there been a period of one month or more when you
        experienced physical pain during intercourse?<br />
         Has there been a period of one month or more when you did
        not find sex pleasurable?<br />
         Has there been a period of one month or more when you felt
        anxious about your ability to perform sexually?<br />
         Has there been a period of one month or more when you had
        trouble keeping an erection when you wanted to?<br />
         [If yes] Have you ever used any treatment to help with
        erections? For example, injections or tablets like
        Viagra.<br />
         During sex do you worry whether your body looks
        unattractive?</p>

      <p class="section">Methods</p>

      <p class="text1">The methods used in the Australian Study of
      Health Relationships (ASHR) are described in detail
      elsewhere.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> Briefly, between
      May 2001 and June 2002, computer-assisted telephone
      interviews were completed by a representative sample of
      10,173 men aged 16&ndash;59 years from households in all
      states and territories of Australia. Respondents were
      selected via modified random-digit dialling, with
      over-sampling of men and residents of some geographical
      areas. The overall response rate was 69.4%. The study
      protocol was approved by the human ethics committees of La
      Trobe University, the University of New South Wales and the
      Central Sydney Area Health Service.</p>

      <p class="text2">The questions used to assess circumcision
      status, STI history, masturbation, sexual practices at last
      encounter, and sexual difficulties are displayed in the Box
      1. (Responses about same-sex partners are not analysed here.)
      <span class="yellow">HIV infection was not included in the
      list of STIs because too few men reported being HIV-positive
      (0.1%) to allow analysis by circumcision status.</span> We
      had previously derived a six-item scale of sexual liberalism
      in which higher scores meant more liberal attitudes (&alpha;
      = 0.75).<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></p>
      <i>Analysis</i> 

      <p class="text1">Data were weighted to adjust for the
      probability of household selection (households with more
      phone lines were more likely to be contacted) and to adjust
      for the probability of selection within a household
      (individuals living in households with more eligible people
      were less likely to be selected). Data were then weighted to
      match the Australian population on the basis of age, gender
      and area of residence.</p>

      <p class="text2">Weighted data were analysed using the survey
      estimation commands in Stata Version 7.0.<sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup> Correlates of outcome variables were
      identified using univariate logistic regression.</p>

      <p class="sub-section"><i>Demographics</i></p>

      <p class="text1">Of the men surveyed, 58.7% reported that
      they had been circumcised. A further 0.4% either refused to
      answer or were unsure. Crude odds ratios (OR) for the
      relationships between circumcision status and demographic
      variables are shown in Table 1. Compared with uncircumcised
      men, circumcised men were likely to be older, to speak
      English at home and to have been born in Australia. Indeed,
      among men under 20, the majority were uncircumcised,
      reversing the pattern among the over 30s, of whom two-thirds
      had been circumcised. Buddhists and other non-Christians, but
      not Muslims, were less likely to be circumcised. Circumcision
      was somewhat more common among those with post-secondary
      education, those living in regional (but not remote) areas,
      and those in managerial or professional occupations.</p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="sub-section"><i>Sexually transmissible
      infections</i></p>

      <p class="text1">In an attempt to correct for exposure to
      infection, we examined the correlations between circumcision
      and experience of various STIs using a logistic regression
      model including age category and numbers of opposite-sex and
      same-sex partners. Thus the odds ratios reported in Table 2
      are the ratios after adjustment for these effects (full table
      available on request). The condition for which circumcision
      appears to exert a protective effect is &ndash; not
      surprisingly &ndash; penile candidiasis (which is much more
      common among women than men,<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup>
      but also occurs under the foreskin). Because many of the
      uncircumcised men are young and have been exposed to fewer
      partners than those over 30, the raw percentages of men with
      a history of thrush (9.8% of circumcised and 5.5% of
      uncircumcised men) underestimate the protective effect of
      circumcision. This is reflected in the adjusted odds ratio of
      0.4. No significant protective effect of circumcision is
      discernible for genital warts, chlamydia, genital herpes,
      gonorrhoea, non-specific urethritis or pubic lice.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision can only be a protective factor
      in men who are exposed to an STI. An additional analysis
      limited to the men who had had (1) more than 10 female
      partners, (2) more than 10 male partners, or (3) more than
      five male partners and more than five female partners (i.e.
      only those exposed to substantial STI risk) also found that
      the difference between circumcised and uncircumcised men was
      significant only for candidiasis (OR 0.492, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] 0.297&ndash;0.814, <i>P</i> = 0.006).</p>

      <p class="sub-section"><i>Sexual difficulties</i></p>

      <p class="text1">The ASHR questionnaire included a set of
      items about sexual difficulties (see Box 1). Respondents were
      not asked whether they perceived these conditions to be
      problems for them. Nor were they asked any direct questions
      about penile sensitivity. For two difficulties, trouble
      keeping an erection and physical pain during intercourse,
      there was a statistically significant difference between
      circumcised and uncircumcised men after adjustment for age
      (Table 3). Trouble keeping an erection was strongly
      correlated with age, occurring in just over 4% of men under
      30 and 19% of men in their 50s.<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> Circumcised men were less likely to
      report this difficulty, and the correlation remained after
      adjustment for age category. It was most noticeable in the
      over 50s, among whom 15% of circumcised men and 27% of
      uncircumcised men reported trouble keeping an erection.</p>

      <p class="text2">Physical pain during intercourse was also
      less common among circumcised men. Although this difficulty
      is rare in men (2.4%) compared with women (20.3%),<sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup> it was more common among
      uncircumcised men, and the difference between the groups was
      apparent in all age categories. There was no evidence of
      circumcision helping men to &lsquo;last longer&rsquo;: <span
      class="yellow">26% of circumcised men but 22% of
      uncircumcised men reported reaching orgasm too quickly for at
      least one month in the previous year.</span> However, this
      difference was not significant (<i>P</i> = 0.11) after
      adjustment for age category.</p>

      <p class="text2">Table 4 also shows the percentage of men who
      engaged in various sexual practices at their last encounter
      with a female partner. None of the practices showed
      significant differences. Despite the commonly quoted view
      among groups where circumcision is the norm that women prefer
      the circumcised penis,<sup><a href="#n21">21</a></sup> there
      was no evidence of any variation in practice that might
      indicate reluctance by women to handle the uncircumcised
      penis or to perform fellatio. After adjustment for age,
      circumcised men were no more or less likely to receive
      fellatio from their female partners than uncircumcised men.
      Similar results were obtained in an analysis of practices
      with male partners (not shown).</p>

      <p class="text1">The mean score on the six-item scale of
      sexual liberalism was 3.29 (95% CI 3.24&ndash;3.34) for
      circumcised men and 3.20 (95% CI 3.15&ndash;3.25) for
      uncircumcised men. (Higher scores represent more liberal
      attitudes.) A regression model adjusting for age category

      <p class="section">Discussion</p>

      <p class="text1">These results come from a large
      representative sample survey with a good response rate.
      Internal and external evidence suggests that telephone
      interview is a good method for collecting sensitive data on
      sexuality.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup> Although
      experience of STIs is likely to be underreported (men may
      have forgotten infections that occurred long ago or may not
      know the name of what they had), a self-report of
      circumcision status is likely to be accurate. A study of the
      validity of a self-report of circumcision status among
      adolescent males demonstrated high sensitivity (91%) and high
      specificity (95%) among those who knew their circumcision
      status.<sup><a href="#n22">22</a></sup> In that study of
      largely Black and Hispanic boys, 27% did not know their
      circumcision status, whereas in our study only 0.1% did not
      know their status, perhaps reflecting our predominantly adult
      sample. We therefore consider substantial misclassification
      unlikely.</p>

      <p class="text2">We have described demographic differences
      among subgroups of the Australian population in circumcision
      prevalence, and found a statistically significant but minor
      effect on sexual health in the greater risk of penile
      candidiasis among the uncircumcised. Although circumcised men
      were less likely to acquire candidiasis, they did not appear
      to be protected against any more serious STIs.</p>

      <p class="text2">Uncircumcised men reported higher rates of
      pain during intercourse than circumcised men (though much
      lower rates than women) and difficulty with erection in their
      50s. Although minor damage to or untreated infection of the
      foreskin, or conditions such as balanitis xerotica
      obliterans,<sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup> might account for
      the higher reports of pain, the reason for the higher
      prevalence of difficulty with erection in the older
      uncircumcised men is unknown and warrants investigation.</p>

      <p class="text2">An analysis of sexual health correlates of
      circumcision status based on the US NHSLS (from which some of
      our questions were drawn)<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup>
      also found slightly higher rates of sexual difficulties,
      specifically trouble with erection, performance anxiety and
      lack of enjoyment, among the uncircumcised men. The
      difference was significant among the oldest age group born in
      the 1930s and early 1940s.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup>
      Being circumcised was less common among those of Black or
      Hispanic ethnicity than among Whites, and among men of lower
      educational status. Uncircumcised men were less likely to
      report masturbation. The authors speculated that &lsquo;it is
      possible that the association between masturbation frequency
      and circumcision status provides a clue. If older men require
      more direct stimulation to function sexually, men for whom
      masturbation is part of their sexual script may be better
      able to adapt sexually as they age.&rsquo; They pointed out
      that &lsquo;differences in the association between
      circumcision status and sexual practice across ethnic groups
      suggest that cultural, rather than physiological, forces may
      be responsible&rsquo; (p. 1057). Despite this remark, the
      study&rsquo;s summary conclusion that &lsquo;circumcised men
      ha[d] a slightly lessened risk of experiencing sexual
      dysfunction&rsquo; (p. 1057) has been quoted by others as
      evidence for the benefits of circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">It is possible that in our study too the
      higher rates of experiencing difficulty with erection in
      uncircumcised men over 50 may be related to their sexual
      script or culture rather than to some physiological effect or
      correlate of circumcision. This suggestion is supported by
      the correlation we found between circumcision and less
      liberal sexual attitudes. However, after adjustment for age
      we found no difference between circumcised and uncircumcised
      men in whether they had masturbated alone in the past year or
      whether they had experienced manual stimulation of the penis
      or fellatio by the female partner in their last sexual
      encounter. If sexual culture rather than any physiological
      factor plays a role here, more nuanced qualitative research
      may be necessary to explore it.</p>

      <p class="text2">Another possibility is that uncircumcised
      men over 50 in our sample were largely drawn from postwar
      European immigrant groups. These men, born between 1942 and
      1952, were often refugees or the children of assisted
      migrants. Those who followed their fathers into industrial
      and agricultural work may have poorer health in middle age
      than their Australian-born counterparts.<sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup> A recent study of the sexual health
      of older Australian men found rates of erectile dysfunction
      higher among those from Italy and eastern Europe, but not in
      those from the UK, Ireland and western Europe.<sup><a
      href="#n27">27</a></sup> Further analysis of our data in
      combination with other studies giving more detail about
      immigrant health would be necessary to test this hypothesis.
      Either way, we should be wary of ascribing a causal benefit
      of circumcision for erectile function in the older male, as
      studies of adult circumcision fail to show a benefit.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13,28</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Although this is a cross-sectional study, we
      can be confident that circumcision preceded any sexual health
      outcomes, as most men were circumcised in infancy.
      Nonetheless, the strong correlations with age and place of
      birth (i.e. cultural background) are likely to confound the
      correlations found. However, the difficulties in
      interpretation of the findings cannot necessarily be solved
      by performing multivariate analyses. Despite the large
      sample, there are not enough men from specific countries
      about which we can make sensible assertions about
      conservatism/liberalism to make subgroup analyses possible.
      Sexual practice is unavoidably social in nature and
      variations in men of different cultural backgrounds cannot
      simply be &lsquo;corrected for&rsquo; as they could in a
      study testing a hypothesis of a physiological effect.</p>

      <p class="text2">The fact that our measures of sexual
      difficulty did not show any major advantages or disadvantages
      for circumcised men does not answer the arguments of
      anti-circumcision campaigners<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup>
      that removal of the foreskin reduces or alters sexual
      sensation. Our questionnaire included no ascertainment of
      penile sensitivity or preferred practices. This question can
      only be answered by openminded research on matched samples,
      employing suitable measures of penile sensitivity and sexual
      practice, and by studies on men undergoing circumcision in
      adulthood.</p>
