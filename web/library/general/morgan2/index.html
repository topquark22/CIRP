      S<font size="1">URGERY</font>, although a declining
      speciality, still plays a role in the economic life of many
      in the medical profession. In this speciality, before an
      operation can qualify as suitable for inclusion in the
      established repertoire, certain criteria have to be
      fulfilled. Firstly, it should require a minimum of skill;
      secondly, it should have few immediate complications-delayed
      complications can always be attributed to other factors; and
      lastly, and above all, there should be a fee attached.
      Circumcision will certainly answer a maiden's prayer, is the
      procedure par excellence for the chronic remunerative
      surgeon.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two origins of
      circumcision can be traced, neither of which has any bearing
      on the reasons why the operation is currently practiced with
      such fervour by many non-Semitic races. In certain African
      and Melanesian tribes, the operation is one of a variety of
      ritual mutilations that are performed in the hope of adding
      allure and charm to the scarified subject. Thus it resembles
      nose-keloid formation, neck elongation, tattooing and
      deliberately induced keloid formation. In this context it is
      relevant to point out that the operation does not find favour
      with all the tribes of New Guinea; a discerning minority of
      the inhabitants of this island deliberately stretch their
      foreskin by dangling weights on it, for to them a pendulous
      prepuce is a thing of beauty and a joy for ever. Rumour has
      it that they are allowed to remove the weights when they
      compete in the high hurdles and pole vault. The other origin
      of circumcision relates to the fact that in many African
      tribes the young male cannot be accepted into his tribe as a
      full-fledged man without first having proved his manhood. To
      do this he is tested by some ordeal, in this case
      circumcision, and if he does not flinch he is then accepted
      as an adult with all of the associated privileges. In parts
      of Africa and also Lebanon, pubertal girls suffer the same
      fate, ostensibly to help keep them faithful during their
      married life. No matter how one looks at the origins of the
      operation, it becomes apparent that it was conceived in
      ignorance and superstition and has been nurtured by man's
      inherent propensity for sadism and masochism.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The medical
      literature dealing with this subject seems endless, and for
      every paper that questions the cult of circumcision, a
      hundred appear glorifying it. The articles written by those
      in favour of the operation are almost without exception
      intense, humourless and terrifyingly evangelical. The
      arguments used to justify the operation are many and
      ingenious-so much that they are occasionally accepted by the
      intelligent physician and almost invariably by the layman.
      Nevertheless, when a critical assessment is made of the
      evidence that purports to show that the possession of a
      foreskin is harmful, the whole hypothesis can be seen to be
      based on a series of non-sequiturs. Let us take a look at the
      reasons that are used to justify this mutilation.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many
      physicians who are under the impression that the foreskin is
      completely retractile at birth. They assume that if it cannot
      be retracted, then the child has phimosis, and the prepuce
      should be lopped off forthwith. In reality the prepuce does
      not become fully retractile until the child is two or three
      years old, and phimosis is all but unknown in infancy. In
      contrast the circumcised child, with his glands exposed to
      uriniferous napkins, is very prone to develop meatal ulcers
      and meatal stenosis-a condition that is never seen in the
      intact subject. It is also stated that cancer of the penis
      occurs only in the uncircumcised. However, cancer of the
      tongue occurs only in those subjects with tongues, and the
      possibility of developing glossal cancer can hardly be used
      as a pretext to prophylactically remove this organ. As has
      been pointed out elsewhere, appendicitis is responsible for
      many more deaths than is penile cancer, but routine
      appendectomy is not yet the rule and is unlikely to become
      so. (<a href="/library/general/morgan/">Morgan</a>, 1965).
      Moreover, penile cancer is a relatively benign form of cancer
      which is fairly amenable to treatment. On the basis of the
      present morbidity and mortality statistics for this disease
      in the United States, Marshall (1956) has pointed out; ``If a
      surgeon would perform one circumcision every ten minutes,
      eight hours a day, and five days a week, he would be able to
      prevent one penile cancer by working steadily for between six
      and 29 years. Since a significant number of penile cancers
      are curable, still more time and labor might be required to
      prevent a fatality from this disease.'' He goes on to state
      that if cancer prevention is to be an end in itself, then
      bilateral simple mastectomy in female infants would probably
      be an even more effective measure. In those countries which
      do not practise circumcision and in whih acquaintance with
      soap and water is more than casual, the incidence of penile
      cancer is ether no different from, or in instances is
      actually less than, the incidence in the U.S.A. Although
      penile cancer is exceptionally rare in circumcised subjects
      in America, Europe and Australia, it is seen not uncommonly
      in Javanese Muslims, not withstanding their denuded
      state.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has also been
      stated that carcinoma of the cervix develops almost entirely
      in women who are married to uncircumcised men. The almost
      complete absence of this form of cancer in Jewesses and nuns
      is thought to confirm this point. In reality, there is little
      to support the theory that circumcision of the husband
      prevents the circumcision of the spouse. Lilienfeld and
      Graham (1958) have pointed out that around 30% of American
      women do not know if their husbands are circumcised or not.
      Elsewhere it is suggested that the French do not have the
      same trouble (<a href="/library/general/morgan/">Morgan,
      1965</a>) Moreover, it has also come to light that around 10
      to 15% of American men do not know their own circumcisional
      status, some making claims that they have had the operation
      when they have not, and vice versa. This difficulty is
      related neither to myopia nor to the combination of gross
      obesity and a short memory. This it is advisable not to
      accept as gospel studies which are based on such inaccurate
      statistical evidence. Jones and McDonald (1955), Boyd and
      Doll (1964) and Stern and Dixon (1961) have all been unable
      to demonstrate that circumcision in anyway prevents the
      development of carcinoma of the cervix. The only adequately
      controlled series that relied visual inspection to ascertain
      the circumcisional status is that of Aitken-Swan and Baird
      (1955). They used 54 cancer patients and 54 controls, and
      were unable to demonstrate any difference between the two
      groups. Relevant also is the fact that Parsees who are of
      Persian origin but now live in India, have a very low
      incidence of cancer of the cervix. These people have
      extremely high standards of hygiene, but do not practice
      circumcision. (Khanolkar, 1950).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the real reasons
      for having the operation performed are considered, the
      situation becomes ludicrous in the extreme. Circumcision in
      the U.S.A. is the rule rather than the exception. The
      American public has come to view circumcision in the same
      light as the other essentials of life-namely, superhighways,
      refrigerators and television sets. As well deprive these
      citizens of their birthright as suggest that they retain
      their prepuce. It has become imperative to lop it off to keep
      up with the Joneses, for in the affluent society status and a
      foreskin are incompatible. And besides in a matriarchal
      civilization such as exists in the New World, the female of
      the species has intuitively and erroneously concluded that
      the denuded phallus has greater appeal and is more aesthetic
      than its intact counterpart. The argument is also put forward
      that the circumcised organ is more hygienic, for the prepuce
      collects nasty secretions. So does the ear; but the removal
      of this rather ugly appendage is frowned upon, and in one
      famous instance cutting it off lead to war-the so-called war
      of Captain Jenkin's Ear. One can be grateful that this worthy
      mariner did not lose his prepuce under similar circumstances,
      for it is likely that the battle would still be raging.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there are no
      valid reasons for circumcision, it would also seem desirable
      to see whether the operation can have undesirable effects,
      Infantile circumcision is not the harmless operation that
      many would have us believe, and is associated with a far from
      negligible mortality and morbidity (<a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a>, 1949).
      Haemorrhage and sepsis are infrequent complications but may
      be serious. Staphylococcus skin infection (Ritter's disease)
      is seen only in circumcised infants (Pequet et al., 1965), as
      is meatal stenosis. When the operation is carried out without
      any complications, this being the usual state of affairs, are
      we entitled to assume that the circumcised phallus can fulfil
      its function as adequately as its intact brother at arms? The
      subcutaneous tissue of the glans is provided with special
      sensory receptors that are concerned with appreciating the
      pleasurable sensations that occur during coitus. They are
      stimulated normally only when the glans is exposed. In the
      circumcised subject these receptors are constantly stimulated
      and lose their sensitivity. During the act of coitus, the
      uncircumcised phallus penetrates smoothly and without
      friction, the prepuce gradually retracting as the organ
      advances. In contrast, when the circumcised organ is
      introduced during coitus, friction develops between the glans
      and the vaginal mucosa. Penetration by the circumcised man
      has been compared to thrusting the foot into a sock held open
      at the top, while on the other hand, penetration by the
      intact counterpart has been likened to slipping the foot into
      a sock that has previously been rolled up. (<a
      href="/library/general/widdicombe/">Whiddon</a>, 1953) Coitus
      without a prepuce in analogous to a colour-blind person
      viewing a Renoir of Van Gogh painting.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should ask
      ourselves whether it is really likely that Nature in all her
      wisdom and pragmatism, would really permit every male child
      to be born into this world with a useless appendage, the
      presence of which, according to some, almost inevitably leads
      to serious consequences, including death.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it has been
      said that the only valid reason for circumcision depends on
      the fact that those circumcised British and Commonwealth
      servicemen who suffered the sandstorms of the Western Desert
      in the last war were somewhat more comfortable than their
      uncircumcised brothers. Perhaps this is the reason why the
      operation finds favour with the Aborigines of the Northern
      Territory. Let us hope that in this instance Australia has
      the good sense to follow in the footsteps of the Old World
      and thereby keep her manhood unmutilated.</p>
