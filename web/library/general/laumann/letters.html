      <p><b>Advantages and Disadvantages of Neonatal
      Circumcision</b></p>
      <a id="schoen" name="schoen"></a> 

      <p>To the Editor - The article by Dr Laumann and
      colleagues<sup>1</sup> supports the conclusions of the 1988
      American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Task Force on
      Circumcision (of which I was the chair) that newborn
      circumcision has potential benefits as well as risks. The
      authors present new information that indicated that
      circumcised men had slight benefit in terms of sexual
      satisfaction and less likelihood of sexual dysfunction. This
      complements a 1988 survey of women that demonstrated female
      sexual preference for circumcised men.<sup>2</sup></p>

      <p>Although the subjective survey method reported by Laumann
      et al is valid for the issue of sexual satisfaction, it is
      not applicable for studying sexually transmitted diseases
      (STDs). As the authors point out, self-reported STDs will be
      underreported because patients with STDs may be asymptomatic,
      and the diagnosis carries a social stigma. Relying on the
      memories of men ranging in age from 18 to 59 years on this
      sensitive topic is not justified. Further it is not valid to
      group all 7 listed STDs. The mechanism of infection of the
      individual STDs can vary (eg, tranfusions and intravous drug
      use as well as sexual transmission for hepatitis B and human
      immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection). The incubation
      period before symptomatic drug symptoms are apparent vary
      widely among the individual STDs (eg, days f or gonorrhea,
      monhs or years for HIV), which can make recall unreliable.
      Moreover, laboratory testing usually is required for
      diagnosis. The risk of drawing conclusions on STDs from this
      study, which has a relatively small sample size (353
      uncircumcised men) and lack of objective data, is exemplified
      by the paucity of the HIV data. Epidemological studies during
      the past decade indicate that uncircumcised men have
      significantly greater risk of acquiring HIV infection than do
      circumcised men.<sup>3-6</sup> These studies as well as
      published devidence on other STDs, are unjustifiably
      trivialized by the unwarranted general conclusion that there
      is no significant difference in risk for STDs between
      circumcised and uncircumcised men.</p>

      <p>To the Editor - Dr. Laumann and colleagues<sup>1</sup>
      conclude that circumcision provides no preventive medical
      benefit, thus reviving an ongoing controversy. While issues
      related to the risk of childhood urinary tract infection with
      or without circumcision may be debatable, the authors have
      been blinded to the medical benefits of circumcision. for
      adults. Indeed only 1 week following the report by Laumann et
      al, Royce et al<sup>2</sup> reported that "male circumcision
      consistently shows a protective effect against HIV
      infection," with an 8-fold increased rate of HIV disease
      among uncircumcised men.<sup>2</sup> Royce et al further
      report a greater incidence of HIV in sexual partners of
      uncircumcised men and speculate that the abundance of
      Langerhans cells in the foreskin may be a contributing factor
      and that the presence of a foreskin actually may increase
      infectiousness.</p>

      <p>Periodic arguments against circumcision have been
      supported by a variety of evidence, much of which has been
      directed toward the "inhumanity" of such procedures. While
      data from studies such as Royce et al<sup>2</sup> should help
      to restore this paper-churning debate to its proper
      perspective, the findings of Laumann et al that sexual
      dysfunction was less common in circumcised men inadvertently
      adds weight to the medical argument.</p>

      <p>To the Editor: Dr. Laumann and colleagues <sup>1</sup>
      conclude that with respect to STDs "there is no evidence of a
      prophylactic role for circumcision and a slight tendency in
      the opposite direction." However, the authors did not
      consider one important aspect of the relationship, if any,
      between male circumcision and the risk of STDs including
      cervical cancer in their female partners. Hunter et al
      <sup>2</sup> found that women whose partners are
      uncircumcised are at increased risk of STDs, including HIV.
      Human papillomavirus (HPC), which plays an important role in
      the pathogenesis of cervical cancer<sup>3</sup> also is
      sexually transmitted, although men are frequently
      asymptomatic. Several studies have shown that women whose
      sexual partners are uncircumcised are at increased risk of
      cervical cancer secondary to HPV. <sup>4,5</sup> These
      findings deserve further examination and, if confirmed, would
      be important information for parents and physicians to
      consider in deciding whether to circumcise or recommend
      circumcision of male infants.</p>

      <p>To the Editor - Circumcision depends upon the perpetuation
      of American cultural beliefs that support it. One way to
      justify inflicting pain and harm on others is to believe that
      otherwise more pain and harm will follow. Using this strategy
      to defend circumcision requires minimizing or denying the
      harm caused by circumcision and producing medical claims
      about protection from potential future pain and harm.
      Circumcision advocates claim that the surgery has
      prophylactic benefits. Laumann et al<sup><a
      href="#g1">1</a></sup> provide another response to this
      belief.</p>

      <p>For some people, claims of medical benefits are sufficient
      justification for circumcision partly because circumcision is
      a surgical procedure that is done on someone else. Using
      medical claims and studies to defend circumcision may be an
      unconscious way for some physicians to avoid the emotional
      discomfort of questioning their own circumcision. A survey of
      primary care physicians showed that circumcision was
      supported more often by physicians were older, male, and
      circumcised.<sup><a href="#g2">2</a></sup></p>

      <p>Full and open debate on the circumcision issue is
      necessary, particularly regarding long-term effects and
      ethical considerations, but this debate has not yet occurred.
      Even with full debate, the overwhelming pain and harm of
      circumcision cannot be proven to many circumcision advocates
      because people tend to avoid new information that strongly
      conflicts with their beliefs.</p>

      <p>Thus far, the feelings of those who must live with the
      decision - the infants - generally have been ignored. The
      fact that infants can't physically resist or stop the
      procedure makes it easy to dismiss their feelings. Of course
      adult feelings are not so easily dismissed. A preliminary
      survey of 75 men suggests that the more men know about the
      important functions of the prepuce, the more likely they are
      to be dissatisfied about being circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#g3">3</a></sup> Now that an increasing number of men
      are learning about the prepuce and expressing this
      dis-satisfaction, clinicians must acknowledge that is
      impossible to predict how a male infant will feel when he is
      older. A prudent course of action would be to allow men to
      make the decision about circumcision themselves when they
      reach adulthood.</p>

      <p>What prevents the adoption of such a new policy is the
      reluctance to acknowledge such a mistake and all that it
      implies. This avoidance of guilt helps to explain the
      tenacity with which some people defend existing circumcision
      policies,<sup><a href="#g3">3</a></sup> and the ongoing
      denial requires the continued acceptance of cultural beliefs.
      More than new studies, clinicians will need courage to
      change. The children of the future are depending on it.</p>

      <p>To the Editor - Dr. Laumann and colleagues<sup><a
      href="#h1">1</a></sup> conclude that data from the National
      Health and Social Life Survey do not lend clear support to
      either side in the circumcision debate. However, by
      demonstrating that circumcision does not reduce the risk of
      contracting STDs, the authors may have knocked another prop
      out from under a medical procedure that already depends on
      the frailest of support. Moreover, their finding that removal
      of the foreskin alters patterns of sexual behavior over a
      lifetime casts further doubt on the appropriateness of
      circumcising infants too young to give informed consent.</p>

      <p>Circumcision is an invasive procedure that is not
      essential to an infant's welfare and virtually always can be
      deferred with little or no risk. The finding that
      circumcision has significant impact in later life adds
      further credibility to the view that a decision regarding
      circumcision should be postponed until a man can choose for
      himself. In 1995, the AAP Committee on Bioethics<sup><a
      href="#h2">2</a></sup> stressed the importance of involving
      children in decisions concerning their health care. The
      committee counseled physicians to view children as persons in
      their own right, with interests distinct from those of their
      parents.</p>

      <p>Neonatal circumcision subjects male infants to an
      operation that they may well reject if they were old enough
      to consider its advantages and disadvantages. A number of
      studies, such as that of Taylor and colleagues,<sup><a
      href="#h3">3</a></sup> have provided evidence that the
      foreskin is a complex structure that performs important
      sensory functions. The summary ablation of this structure
      prior to the age of consent infringes on one of the most
      basic human rights, namely, the right to physical
      integrity.</p>

      <p>Although the courts have traditionally emphasized the
      importance of the family, the rights of parents to govern
      their children are by no means unrestricted. In a society
      founded upon respect for the individual, it is clearly in the
      interest of a child to participate whenever possible, in
      decisions concerning his or her own body.</p>

      <p>Circumcision is an irreversible procedure that confers
      few, if any, prophylactic benefits and appears to have
      long-term effects on sexual behavior. Hippocrates advised his
      followers to treat patients conservatively. Perhaps it is
      time that infant males born in America were once again
      treated in accordance with a principle that has formed a
      cornerstone for the practice of medicine since ancient
      times.</p>

      <p>To the Editor: I read with great anticipation the article
      on circumcision in the United States<sup>1</sup>, after
      hearing the press release about this article on the news.
      However, I not only was sorely disappointed int he results
      and conclusions in this study, but must say that I have never
      read an article that had so many generalities, such as
      "slight tendency," "slightly less likely," "may have," "it
      seems unlikely," "results escape easy interpretation," "cast
      doubt," and "may reflect attitudes." I found the article to
      be highly unscientific and probably more suitable for
      publication in a journal of sociology or perhaps psychology
      than in a medical journal.</p>

      <p>Perhaps the most obvious example was a comment by the
      authors that "Results may also have been affected by the
      possibility that some respondents did not know whether they
      had been circumcised." I rest my case.</p>

      <p>To the Editor - That the article by Dr. Laumann et
      al<sup><a href="#vh1">1</a></sup> documented differences in
      the sexual practices of men with regard to circumcision
      status is not surprising. Surgical removal of the prepuce
      results in the loss of the majority of fine-touch
      neuroreceptors found in the penis,<sup><a
      href="#vh2">2</a></sup> leaving only the exposed nerve glans,
      which is innervated with free nerve endings that can only
      sense deep pressure and pain.<sup><a
      href="#vh3">3</a></sup></p>

      <p>A hypothesis is needed to explain the findings of Laumann
      et al in the light of the known neurohistology. We suggest
      that a penis with foreskin and its full complement of
      neuroreceptors may make heterosexual coitus more satisfying,
      thereby making the man less likely to seek out alternate
      forms of stimulation. The only portion of the prepuce
      remaining in a man with surgically altered genitals is the
      remnant between the corona and the scar. While there are some
      fine-touch receptors in this tissue, the most sensitive
      portion of the prepuce at the tip is removed in even the most
      moderate circumcision.<sup><a href="#vh2">2</a></sup> The
      remaining prepuce and any remaining portions of the frenulum
      can be preferentially stimulated by masturbation and oral
      sex, whereas the sensation of deep pressure dominates during
      hetero- sexual coitus. The imbalance from not having the
      input from the missing fine touch receptors may make the
      experience less satisfying, causing a man with an incomplete
      penis to supplement his sexual experiences with other forms
      of stimulation.</p>

      <p>To date the effect of circumcision on sexual function has
      not been carefully studied. In rodent studies, removal of the
      prepuce resulted in marked changes in the mechanics of
      copulation,<sup><a href="#vh4">4</a></sup> the hormonal
      response of the female partner, and aggressive behavior. In
      humans, behavioral alterations have been demonstrated in the
      pain response of circumcised infants.<sup><a
      href="#vh5">5</a></sup> Unfortunately, studies of men
      circumcised as adults have had too few subjects or
      differences in sensation were not well documented. Testing
      penile vibratory thresholds has demonstrated that men
      experience increasing thresholds with age, while those with
      premature ejaculation have low thresholds regardless of
      age.<sup><a href="#vh5">5</a></sup> Application of this
      technique could be used to demonstrate if a sensation
      differences exists between circumcised and uncircumcised
      men.</p>

      <p>In Reply: Collectively, the letters commenting on our
      article on circumcision are a microcosm of the highly
      contentious state of opinion on the wisdom of mass neonatal
      circumcision in the United States. Most of the authors make
      useful reference to other studies that bear on evaluating the
      impact of circumcision on such issues as penile sensitivity,
      sexual satisfaction and transmission of other diseases to sex
      partners (eg, cervical cancer) that we could not examine
      because of the limitations of clinical data gathering imposed
      by a broad-based population survey such as ours. However, we
      take strong exception to Dr. Schoen's observation that the
      survey method is simply inapplicable because of its
      invalidity for studying STDs. We acknowledged in our article
      the limitations of self-reported STDs from a lay population,
      especially with respect to under reporting because of
      selective recall, lack of awareness and of diagnosis of
      asymptomatic disease, and the avoidance of social stigma. We
      found that 17% of the men reported that they had been
      informed of medical diagnoses of specific STDs, and that such
      experiences were associated with risk factors, such as
      numbers of partners, condom use, and military service, that
      the literature would lead us to expect.<sup>2,3</sup>
      Moreover, lacking a plausible mechanism that links the
      presence or absence of a foreskin with a differential ability
      to recall and report medically diagnosed STD experiences, we
      fail to see the significance of Schoen's remarks regarding
      our findings.</p>

      <p>Drs. Berman, Ross, and Schoen refer to studies claiming a
      prophylactic effect of circumcision against HIV transmission
      in African populations as inconsistent with our findings for
      the United States. Our study, however, does provide evidence
      that there are strongly associated social and behavioral
      co-variants with circumcision status that include social
      background characteristics, such as age, education,
      race/ethnicity, and sexual practices and preferences. In
      short, circumcision is a marker for a complex array of social
      and behavioral characteristics that are known to be
      implicated in STD transmission. It is certainly the case that
      circumcision in Africa also is heavily influenced by social
      factors, such as tribal affiliation and religion (eg
      Islam),<sup>3</sup> and these factors have important
      implications for sexual practices and partner choice. Without
      rigorous, systematic control for cofactors relevant to the
      particularities of the African context, the prophylactic
      status of the presence or absence of the foreskin remains an
      open question.</p>
