      <h2>CIRCUMCISION IN THE UNITED STATES</h2>

      <h3>Prevalence, Prophylactic Effects, and Sexual
      Practice</h3>

      <p class="author">Edward O. Laumann, PhD; Christopher M.
      Masi, MD; Ezra W. Zuckerman, MA</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Objective. -</b> To assess the prevalence of
        circumcision across various social groups and examine the
        health and sexual outcomes of circumcision.</p>

        <p><b>Design. -</b> An analysis of data from the National
        Health and Social Life Survey.</p>

        <p><b>Participants. -</b> A national probability sample of
        1410 American men aged 18 to 59 years at the time of the
        survey. In addition, an oversample of black and Hispanic
        minority groups is included in comparative analyses.</p>

        <p><b>Main Outcome Measures. -</b> The contraction of
        sexually transmitted diseases, the experience of sexual
        dysfunction, and experience with a series of sexual
        practices.</p>

        <p><b>Results. -</b> We find no significant differences
        between circumcised and uncircumcised men in their
        likelihood of contracting sexually transmitted diseases.
        However uncircumcised men appear slightly more likely to to
        experience sexual dysfunctions, especially later in life.
        Finally, we find that circumcised men engage in a more
        elaborated set of sexual practices. This pattern differs
        across ethnic groups, suggesting the influence of social
        factors.</p>

        <p><b>Conclusions. -</b> The National Health and Social
        Life Survey evidence indicates a slight benefit of
        circumcision but a negligible association with most
        outcomes. These findings inform existing debates on the
        utility of circumcision. The considerable impact of
        circumcision status on sexual practice represents a new
        finding that should further enrich such discussion. Our
        results support the view that physicians and parents be
        informed of the potential benefits and risks before
        circumcising newborns.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p class="text">NUMEROUS recent studies have attempted to
      assess the value of neonatal circumcision. Several have
      determined that the procedure has positive effects. For
      example an association has been found between circumcision
      and lower rates of urinary tract infections in
      infancy,<sup><a href="#n1">1,2</a></sup> as well as lower
      rates of certain sexually transmitted diseases (STD),<sup><a
      href="#n3">3,4</a></sup> As a result of these and other
      findings, the 1989 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Task
      Force on Circumcision shifted its previous position,<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> acknowledging that circumcision has
      certain potential medical benefits that must be weighed
      against its risks<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Male
      satisfaction has also been debated. Some believe that
      circumcision reduces male sensitivity and coital enjoyment
      while others argue that circumcision may afford greater
      ejaculatory control.<sup><a href="#n7">7,8</a></sup> Masters
      and Johnson reported no clinically significant difference in
      the tactile sensitivity of the glans,<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> More recent reports suggest the
      sensitivity of the circumcised glans may in fact be
      reduced.<sup><a href="#n10">10,11</a></sup> Such claims of
      reduced sexual satisfaction for circumcised men have spurred
      a significant movement against the circumcision of infants
      and the reversing of circumcision in adult men. A <a
      href="/library/restoration/goodwin1/">technique of
      uncircumcising</a> has even been introduced.<sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup> Nevertheless, little consensus
      exists regarding the role of the foreskin in sexual
      performance and satisfaction.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      present study attempts to shed light on the circumcision
      debate by exploiting the National Health and Social Life
      Survey (NHSLS), a unique data source on the sexual,
      attitudinal, and health-related experiences of circumcised
      and uncircumcised Americans. Our analysis of these data
      proceeds as follows. First, we describe the prevalence of
      circumcision in the NHSLS sample. Beyond limited records on
      historical circumcision rates, very little is known regarding
      how the practice is distributed across various groups and
      strata of Americans. Second, we illustrate how the NHSLS data
      speak to current debates regarding the effect of neonatal
      circumcision on outcomes such as STDs and sexual
      dysfunctions. Finally, we present results indicating
      significant differences between circumcised and uncircumcised
      men in terms of their sexual practices.</p>

      <h3>METHODS</h3>

      <p class="section"><b>Survey</b></p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NHSLS
      conducted in 1992, is a nationally representative probability
      sample of 1511 men and 1981 women between the ages of 18 and
      59 years living in households throughout the United States.
      It covers about 97% percent of the population in this age
      group - roughly 150 million Americans. It excludes people
      living in group quarters such as barracks, college
      dormitories, and prisons as well as those who do not know
      English well enough to be interviewed. There is an oversample
      of African Americans (n=458) and Hispanics (n=267). The
      sample completion rate was greater than 79%. Checks with
      other high quality samples (eg, Census Bureau's Current
      Population Survey) suggest that the NHSLS succeeded in
      getting a truly representative sample of the population. Each
      person was surveyed in person by experienced interviewers,
      who watched respondents on various social attributes, for an
      interview averaging 90 minutes in duration. Extensive
      discussion of the sampling design and evaluation of sample
      and data quality can be found in Laumann et al.<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
      respondent's circumcision status was ascertained by asking
      him whether he was circumcised. He was not asked, however, if
      the procedure was performed as a newborn or later in life.
      Experience with STDs was measured by asking respondents if
      they had ever been told by a doctor that they had a specified
      list of such diseases, which were identified by medical names
      as well as vernacular names (eg, gonorrhea, clap, or drip).
      Experience of sexual dysfunction was ascertained with the
      following question:</p>

      <p class="text">Sometimes people go through periods in which
      they are not interesting in sex or are having trouble
      achieving sexual gratification. I have just a few questions
      about whether you have experienced this in the past twelve
      months. During the past twelve months, has there been a
      period of several months or more when you ...</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
      question was asked regarding a series of sexual dysfunctions
      ranging from the inability to climax to lacking interest in
      sex. Respondents were also asked regarding their engagement
      in various sexual practices. Lifetime experience of a series
      of partnered behavior was ascertained by asking whether they
      had engaged in various sexual acts during their lifetimes.
      Respondents were also asked to describe the frequency with
      which they masturbated on a 10-point scale ranging from
      "never" to "every day."</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used a
      series of univariate and multivariate tests to chart the
      distribution of circumcision and examine its effects. In
      assessing the prevalence of circumcision for various social
      groups, we preformed multiple logistic regression of group
      membership on circumcision status and calculated adjusted
      odds rations (ORs) that reflected the odds of being
      circumcised for group members relative to all others in the
      sample. In addition, we examined how such differences have
      changed over time by repeating the analyses within 3 broad
      age cohorts.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      assessing the impact of circumcision on the contraction of
      STDs and susceptibility to sexual dysfunction, we performed a
      series of 2-tailed t tests to uncover significant differences
      between circumcised and uncircumcised men across a wide array
      of related outcomes. Next, we estimated logistic equations
      for each of the STDs and dysfunctions of circumcision status
      and a series of control variables. These factors included the
      number of lifetime sexual partners; education;
      race/ethnicity; religion, nativity; residence in urban;
      suburban, or rural areas; a 7-point scale indicating how
      liberal or conservative were the respondents sexual
      attitudes<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>; and the
      respondent's age. Net of these controls, we calculated
      adjusted ORs for the odds of having the various STDs and
      dysfunctions for circumcised relative to uncircumcised
      respondents. Finally, we repeated these comparisons within
      categories of a critical third variable - for STDs, the
      number of lifetime sexual partners reported by the
      respondents, and for sexual dysfunction, the respondent's
      age.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
      conducted similar analyses to assess the association between
      circumcision status and various sexual practices. We
      performed logistic regression to assess this association with
      the respondent's masturbation experience. In addition, we
      repeated this analysis as a logistic regression with a
      critical cutoff point, masturbating at least once a month, as
      the dependent variable. As results from this analysis matched
      that from the ordered logit, we present the logistic
      regression results to afford comparability with the other
      analyses conducted. In all of the models of sexual practices,
      we controlled for the same factors listed above. However, we
      excluded the number of lifetime sexual partners, a variable
      that is confounded with the tendency to engage in various
      practices. When this variable is included as a regressor,
      results for masturbation remain significant and findings
      regarding heterosexual oral sex weaken somewhat. In addition,
      we repeated the analyses for each of the 3 major ethnic
      groups featured in the survey, whites, blacks, and Hispanics.
      All analyses were performed using Stata version 4.0.<sup><a
      href="#n14">14</a></sup></p>

      <h3>RESULTS</h3>

      <p class="section">Prevalence of Circumcision</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the
      age range of males participating in the NHSLS was 18 to 59
      years, estimates of the prevalence of neonatal circumcision
      can be calculated for the years 1933 to 1974. As shown in the
      Figure, the steady increase in circumcision rates among
      respondents during much of this period reflects the increase
      identified by other investigators.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> The proportion of newborns that were
      circumcised reached 80% in the years after World War II and
      climaxed in the mid 1960s. This rise mirrors the increasing
      prevalence of hospital births. In addition, a slight decline
      in the proportion of newborns circumcised occurred in the
      last years covered by the survey, about the time when the
      medical establishment began to question the value of routine
      neonatal circumcision. Overall 77% of the 1284 US-born men
      surveyed in the main NHSLS sample were circumcised, compared
      with 42% of the non-US born men.</p>

      <center>
        <img alt="Table" src="Fig1.gif" />
      </center>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 1
      analyzes circumcision rates for religious, racial, and
      socioeconomic groupings of US-born respondents. We see that
      differences in circumcision rates across groups are not
      great. As may be expected, Jewish men report the largest
      proportion circumcised.</p>

      <center>
        <img alt="Table one" src="Table1.gif" />
      </center>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
      given the small number of Jews surveyed in the NHSLS, this
      does not result in a significantly adjusted OR. Mainline
      Protestants (including, eg, Methodists, Presbyterians,
      Lutherans, and Episcopalians) are somewhat more likely than
      conservative Protestants to be circumcised (see Laumann et
      al<sup><a href="#n13">13(pp 146-147)</a></sup> for rationale
      and details on coding of religious groups). However, as
      indicated by the insignificant adjusted OR, this difference
      disappears when race is controlled. Indeed, the predominant
      pattern is one of high circumcision rates for all major
      American religious groups.</p>

      <p class="text">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Differences in
      circumcision levels across racial and ethnic groups are more
      revealing. In particular, whites are considerably more likely
      to be circumcised than are blacks or Hispanics (81% vs 65% or
      54%). These differences remain significant when other
      variables are controlled. Net of these factors, the odds of a
      black being circumcised are roughly half (95% confidence
      interval[CI], 0.40-0.85) that of whites; the odds for
      Hispanics are about one third (95% CI, 0.26-0.44) that of
      whites. There has been some convergence in circumcision rates
      for the 3 groups across cohorts, though differences among
      groups have persisted (Table 1).</p>

      <p class="text">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumcision rates vary
      significantly by the level of education obtained by a
      respondent's mother. The critical break occurred between
      respondents whose mothers did and did not earn a high school
      diploma. While 62% of respondents whose mothers did not
      finish high school were circumcised, the rate for all other
      respondents varied form 84% to 87%. These differences
      remained significant when other factors were controlled. Net
      of such factors, the odds of being circumcised for
      respondents whose mothers earned at least a high school
      diploma was about 2.5 times (95% CI, 1.9-3.8) that of those
      whose mothers were less educated. This discrepancy appeared
      to be narrowing in more recent cohorts. Among the youngest
      group of respondents, only those whose mothers had finished
      college displayed a significantly higher circumcision rate
      than those whose mothers had not earned a high school
      diploma.</p>

      <p class="section">Sexually Transmitted Diseases</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 2
      compares the incidence of various STDs reported by
      circumcised and uncircumcised respondents. Note that in this
      and subsequent tables, circumcision status serves as an
      independent variable rather than a dependent variable.
      Dependent variables are listed in the first column of these
      tables.</p>

      <center>
        <img alt="Table two" src="Table2.gif" />
      </center>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
      class="yellow">Several instructive features of the data
      presented in Table 2 deserve attention. First, circumcision
      status does not appear to lower the likelihood of contracting
      an STD. Rather, the opposite pattern holds.</span>
      Circumcised men were slightly more likely to have had both a
      bacterial and a viral STD in their lifetime. While these
      differences are not statistically significant, they do not
      lend support to the thesis that circumcision helps prevent
      the contraction of STDs. Indeed, for chlamydia, the
      difference between circumcised men and uncircumcised men is
      quite large. While 26 of 1033 circumcised men had contracted
      chlamydia in their lifetime, non of the 353 uncircumcised men
      reported having had it.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 2
      shows a marked decrease in the experience of STDs as the
      number of partners increases. The small, nonsignificant
      tendency for circumcised men to contract STDs at greater
      rates appeared for each category of sexual experience. In
      addition, contraction of bacterial STDs occurred at a
      significantly greater rate for men who have had more than 20
      sex partners in their lifetimes. Among circumcised men with
      such a sexual background, the odds of contracting a bacterial
      STD are estimated at 2.88 that for uncircumcised men. While
      significant, the exact size of the difference is difficult to
      establish as indicated by the wide confidence interval (95%
      CI, 1.03-9.03). Note as well that this difference is driven
      largely by differential contraction of gonorrhea.</p>

      <p class="section">Sexual Dysfunction</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
      some difficulties, such as experiencing pain during sex, were
      rare, Table 3 demonstrates that sexual dysfunction is a
      relatively common event for American men. Approximately 45%
      of both circumcised and uncircumcised men experience at least
      one of these dysfunctions in the year prior to the survey. In
      addition, the data suggest a slight tendency for such
      dysfunctions to plague uncircumcised men. When all age groups
      are considered, almost every dysfunction is slightly more
      common among men who have not been circumcised. In
      particular, the likelihood of having difficulty in
      maintaining an erection is significantly lower for
      circumcised men When other factors are considered, the
      difference in the odds of experiencing this dysfunction for
      circumcised men is significantly less than for circumcised
      men (OR, 0.66), but only at the 0.07 level (95% CI,
      0.42-1.03).</p>

      <center>
        <img alt="Table three" src="Table3.gif" />
      </center>

      <p class="text">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant differences
      are more prominent when we examine the association between
      sexual dysfunction and circumcision status within age
      cohorts. While there appears to be little difference between
      circumcision status and sexual dysfunction for the two
      younger cohorts, the association is quite strong for the
      oldest group of respondents. (Table 3). Of the 7 sexual
      dysfunctions considered, uncircumcised older men were more
      likely to experience everyone of these difficulties than are
      their uncircumcised peers. Three of these differences are
      statistically significant even in the presence of controls.
      The odds of a circumcised man experiencing anxiety about his
      performance were approximately half that for his
      uncircumcised peers. (95% CI, 0.22-0.95); the odds of a
      member of the former group having difficulty achieving or
      maintaining an erection are about 0.40 that for the latter
      group (95% CI, 0.16-0.77). Overall, the odds that a
      circumcised man of the oldest cohort experienced sexual
      dysfunction was 0.48 that for uncircumcised men of the same
      age group (95% CI, 0.28-0.79). Thus, while, circumcised men
      did not generally appear to experience greater rates of
      sexual dysfunction, older circumcised men did display lower
      levels of dysfunction.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Comment: It goes against common sense
      that a penis injured by circumcision would be more functional
      than an intact penis. Socio-economic status is an indicator
      for general health. Poor circulatory health may impair
      erectile function and is more likely to be associated with
      low socio-economic status. Laumann failed to control for
      socio-economic status in this part of his study although he
      did do so in other parts. See <a
      href="/library/general/laumann/letters#vanhowe">comment</a>
      by Van Howe &amp; Cold. Also, Fink <i>et al</i>. found
      opposite results in their <a
      href="/library/sex_function/fink1/">study</a>.]</p>

      <p class="section">Sexual Practice</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown
      in Table 4, <span class="yellow">NHSLS data indicate that
      circumcised men engage in a somewhat more elaborated set of
      sexual practices than do men who are not circumcised. For
      each of the practices examined, lifetime experience of
      various forms of oral and anal sex and masturbation frequency
      in the past year, circumcised men engaged in these behaviors
      at greater rates. The difference between circumcised men was
      greatest for masturbation - ironically, a practice that
      circumcision was once thought to limit. A total of 47% of
      circumcised men reported masturbating at least once a month
      vs 34% for their uncircumcised peers.</span> This difference
      remains significant even when various demographic factors are
      controlled. The odds of a circumcised man masturbating at
      least once a month are estimated at 1.4 (95% CI, 1.04-1.89)
      that for uncircumcised men. In terms of lifetime sexual
      experience, the greatest differences occurred for
      heterosexual oral sex. In models with controls, circumcision
      status was associated with active heterosexual oral sex with
      a probability of insignificance of 0.07 (OR, 1.37; 95%CI,
      0.97-1.92) and with passive heterosexual oral sex with a
      probability of insignificance of 0.08 (OR, 1.36; 95%CI,
      0.96-1.93).</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      association between circumcision status and the various
      sexual practices exhibited differences across ethnic groups
      (Table 4). While circumcised men of all 3 ethnic groups
      tended to engage in more elaborated set of sexual practices,
      this was less true of blacks and Hispanics. For white men,
      the difference between being circumcised and being
      uncircumcised was quite stark. Circumcised men exhibited a
      greater likelihood of experiencing each of the various
      practices. In particular, the estimated ratio of the odds of
      masturbating at least once a month for circumcised men was
      1.76 that for uncircumcised men (95% CI, 1.24-2.51). The
      adjusted OR for both forms of heterosexual oral sex were
      significant as well. These associations were less consistent
      for blacks and Hispanics. While circumcised Hispanic men did
      masturbate at a slightly higher rate than did their
      uncircumcised peers, no such difference appeared for blacks.
      Similarly, while circumcised black men exhibited a greater
      tendency to engage in passive oral sex than did uncircumcised
      black men (this difference was insignificant when other
      factors are controlled), the reverse was true among Hispanic
      men. Thus, while circumcision status appeared to be
      significantly linked with a higher likelihood to engage in
      various sexual practices, this applied mostly to whites and
      considerably less for blacks and Hispanics.</p>

      <h3>COMMENT</h3>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
      class="yellow">The United States stands apart from the rest
      of the world for its high rates of neonatal
      circumcision.</span> Nevertheless, medical research on the
      topic has generated an ambiguous set of results regarding the
      impact of circumcision on the lives of men. As a result,
      rhetoric has reached a fever pitch as each side of the debate
      appeals to divergent criteria to make its case. Recognizing
      the merit of each position, the AAP has counseled that
      parents be fully informed of the risks and benefits of the
      procedure before deciding to have their son circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
      analysis of the NHSLS furnishes information that should be
      useful in such decision-making processes. We ascertained the
      prevalence of circumcision among American men as well as its
      impact on sexually transmitted diseases, sexual functioning,
      and sexual practice and preferences. Each of these areas
      generated noteworthy findings.</p>

      <p class="section">Prevalence</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
      respect to prevalence, we demonstrated that circumcision
      rates are greatest among whites and better educated
      respondents and that Americans of various religions do not
      display significantly different rates. The latter fact
      illustrates the unique cultural status maintained by
      circumcision in the United States. While circumcision has
      been employed as a religious marker in other Western
      societies, it has clearly lost such an association in
      America. American religious organizations have never strongly
      objected to the circumcision of its members, as they have
      instead deferred to medical authority on this subject.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several
      factors may account for differential rates across ethnic
      groups. First, as race is associated with socioeconomic
      differences between Americans, these differences reflect the
      greater tendency for middle-class parents to desire
      circumcision for their sons. Similarly, blacks and Hispanics
      are concentrated is such regions as the South or Southwest
      where circumcision is less prevalent. However, the fact that
      differences in circumcision rates remain significant when
      region and class are controlled suggests that the various
      racial groups may have different preferences for
      circumcision. Members of groups for whom circumcision is less
      common may avoid circumcision for their sons so a sense of
      shared physical appearance is retained. Indeed, a recent
      study revealed that such social considerations typically
      outweigh various medical issues in determining parents'
      circumcision decisions.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with
      race, differences among socioeconomic groupings may result
      from a differential likelihood of being born in a hospital.
      However, this difference remained salient even in later
      periods where hospital births were virtually universal. Thus,
      it again appears likely that significant social variation
      exists in the preference for and acceptance for circumcision.
      Better-educated parents, who are more likely to be exposed to
      the prevailing scientific wisdom favoring circumcision and to
      be exposed to significant social pressure to conform to this
      wisdom, circumcised their sons at greater levels than less
      educated parents.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum,
      we see that just as significant social institutions have
      played critical roles in the propagation of neonatal
      circumcision in the United States, the practice spread and
      persisted differentially across social groups. In contrast to
      societies where circumcision has indicated religious or
      cultic difference, the popularity of circumcision in 20th
      century United States clearly reflects social distinctions
      that are salient in contemporary society. Those social groups
      that had the education and cultural affinity for following
      the recommendations of medical and state authorities adopted
      circumcision while those groups who maintained a more distant
      relationship to such institutions did not embrace the
      practice to a comparable degree.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that
      these results should be treated with some caution when
      applied to rates of neonatal circumcision. The NHSLS
      respondents were asked whether they were circumcised, but not
      if the procedure was performed as a newborn or later in life.
      Given the rarity of circumcision on nonnewborns<sup><a
      href="#n16">16</a></sup> and the match of our data with
      existing records on neonatal circumcision, we feel that it is
      reasonable to assume that different rates across social
      groups reflect differential experience at time of birth. Note
      that this assumption is not necessary for examining the
      association between circumcision status and various outcomes.
      In such cases, the procedure must only have been performed
      before the outcome in question. A second source of ambiguity
      concerns the accuracy of respondents' reports of their
      circumcision status. Research from the 1950s<sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup> and on adolescents in the
      1980s<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup> suggests that up to a
      third of men may not know their circumcision status. While we
      have no means of independently verifying respondents'
      reports, we control for education in all of our models, a
      variable that should significantly impact knowledge of
      circumcision status.</p>

      <p class="section">Sexually transmitted diseases</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
      class="yellow">With respect to STDs, we found no evidence of
      a prophylactic role for circumcision and a slight tendency in
      the opposite direction. Indeed, the absence of a foreskin was
      significantly associated with contraction of bacterial STDs
      among men who have had many partners in their lifetimes.
      These results suggest a reexamination of the prevailing
      wisdom regarding the prophylactic effect of circumcision.
      While circumcision may have an impact that was not picked up
      by the NHSLS data, it seems unlikely to justify the claims
      made by those who base their support for widespread
      circumcision on it.</span></p>

      <p class="text">Several cautions apply to these findings,
      however. The NHSLS self-reports of STD contraction were
      almost certainly underreports, because respondents may have
      lacked knowledge that they had the STD if it was asymptomatic
      or never diagnosed, or if they did not understand the
      diagnosis. Moreover, given the social stigma associated with
      having STDs, some respondents may have been reluctant to
      report that they had such a condition. Considerable effort
      was expended in minimizing underreporting by devising an
      interview protocol that gave a maximum sense of privacy and
      confidentiality, that persuaded the respondent of full
      disclosure for public health reasons, and provided memory
      aids to facilitate respondent recall. Even if these
      procedures were especially effective, and we think they were,
      we must still acknowledge that the self-reports understate
      the incidence of STDs to a substantial but still unknown
      extent. In addition, there may have been systematic biases in
      underreporting related to particular attributes of
      respondents. In particular, we might expect better educated
      people to be more knowledgeable about disease labels than
      less well educated people. By contrast, however, better
      educated persons may be more sensitive to the social stigma
      associated with having an STD. Controlling for education in
      the various models helped but probably did not fullly redress
      these issues.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results
      may also have been affected by the possibility that some
      respondents did not know whether they had been circumcised.
      If one assumes that respondents were more likely to say that
      they were circumcised (ie, the default answer is to give an
      affirmative answer to any question) and that the same people
      report higher levels of STDs, this may account for any
      association found. While we feel that such distortions are
      small, it is worth reiterating that the principal result of
      the presented analysis is that no discernible differences in
      STD experience can be found to distinguish circumcised and
      uncircumcised men.</p>

      <p class="section">Sexual dysfunctions</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NHSLS
      data suggest a benefit of circumcision with respect to sexual
      dysfunction. Circumcised men were slightly less likely than
      those who had not been circumcised to experience various
      sexual difficulties. This difference was significant among
      the oldest age group. Interestingly, this age group presents
      the best test for establishing differences between
      circumcised and uncircumcised men. as it contains comparable
      numbers of both. It would seem then that NHSLS data supply
      some support for those who see circumcision as performing a
      positive role in promoting healthy sexual behavior. This
      appears most true for older men. While there may be many
      sources for this relationship, it is possible that the
      association between masturbation frequency and circumcision
      status (discussed below) provides a clue. If older men
      require more direct stimulation to function sexually, men for
      whom masturbation is part of their sexual script<sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup> may be better able to adapt sexually
      as they age. Clearly such reasoning must remain speculative
      until further research is performed.</p>

      <p class="section">Sexual practice</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
      findings regarding sexual practice pose the greatest
      challenge for future research. NHSLS results reveal a clear
      pattern in that circumcised men report a more highly
      elaborated set of sexual practices. In particular, the
      association between circumcision status and masturbation
      frequency was quite strong. Similar results, at a somewhat
      weaker level, occurred for heterosexual oral sex. These
      results escape easy interpretation. Certainly, they cast
      doubt on the Victorian-era notion that circumcision reduces
      the urge to masturbate.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we
      do not wish to push speculation too far, differences in the
      association between circumcision status and sexual practice
      across ethnic groups suggest that cultural, rather than
      physiological forces may be responsible. In particular, the
      presented results may reflect attitudes regarding the
      cultural acceptability of the uncircumcised penis. Note that
      the association of circumcision with experience of sexual
      practices is weakest among ethnic minorities for whom
      circumcision is less prevalent. Among whites by contrast,
      uncircumcised men are relatively uncommon. A consequence of
      this may be that a certain stigma is attached to the
      uncircumcised penis by the white population. If the
      uncircumcised penis assumes a somewhat negative cultural
      association among whites, this may lead uncircumcised men to
      engage in a somewhat less elaborated set of sexual
      practices.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Comment: Laumann does not indicate that
      he is aware of the <a
      href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">findings</a> of Taylor et al.
      regarding the innervation of the foreskin that were reported
      more than a year before Laumann's study was published.
      Laumann attributes changes in sexual behavior in circumcised
      men to social and cultural factors. It is far more likely
      that the changes are due to the loss of the sexual and
      erogenous functions of the excised foreskin.]</p>

      <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
      NHSLS results do not lead clear support to either side of the
      circumcision debate, they make a significant contribution to
      our knowledge regarding the potential risks and benefits of
      circumcision. In addition to documenting the prevalence of
      circumcision across various social groups, we have discovered
      that circumcision provides no discernible prophylactic
      benefit and may in fact increase the likelihood of STD
      contraction; that circumcised men have a slightly lessened
      risk of experiencing sexual dysfunction, especially among
      older men; and that circumcised men displayed a greater rates
      of experience of various sexual practices. While evidence
      regarding STD experience contributes to ongoing debates, our
      results concerning sexual dysfunction suggest the need for
      continued research that should further aid parents in
      weighing the benefits and risks of circumcising their
      sons.</p>
