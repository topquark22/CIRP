      <p class="title"><b><i>Circumcision &mdash; It is ever
      Necessary?</i></b></p>

      <p class="author">MATT McHUGH<br />
       F.R.C.S.I.</p>

      <p>Dr. Steevens&rsquo; Hospital<br />
       <a href="" target="_blank">Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for
      Sick Children</a><br />
       St. Anne's Skin and Cancer Hospital<br />
       Dublin</p>

      <p class="text1">The surgery of the penis and scrotum
      antedates recorded history, for the earliest cave paintings
      provide evidence of mutilation of this and other extremities.
      We know from the Australian aboriginal practices of Arinths
      and Tokalosie that subincision of the urethra again and again
      could mark a man&rsquo;s advancement in the tribal hierarchy
      just as his circumcision denoted his initiation to the
      totem.</p>

      <p class="text2">There are many reasons advanced in favour of
      circumcision, most of which are unconvincing when critically
      examined.</p>

      <p class="text2"><b>Circumcision in the Newborn</b><br />
       The foreskins of 96 per cent of newborn infants cannot be
      fully retracted and, hence, &ldquo;Phimosis&rdquo; is
      physiologic in the newborn. The inner surface of the prepuce
      and the glans share a common epithelium, erroneously termed
      &ldquo;adhesions&rdquo;, which separates around the timer of
      birth, or much later. It is impossible to say at birth which
      children will subsequently develop clinically significant
      phimosis.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the majority of boys, in the age group,
      five to thirteen years, non-retractibility of the foreskin
      depends on the persistence of a few strands of tissue between
      prepuce and glans, that minimal force is required to achieve
      retractibility. In this age group, however, retraction of the
      hitherto unretracted prepuce reveals inpissated smegma which,
      in contrast to that found in the younger child is in most
      cases malodorous. This, together with the fact discussed
      under penile cancer, indicates that a different view be taken
      of the unretracted prepuce in the child over about five
      years, and that, whereas an unretractable prepuce in the
      young child should be accepted with equanimity as normal,
      after about three years of age steps should be taken to
      render the prepuce of all boys retractible and capable of
      being kept clean.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The previous paragraph does not
      contain current recommendations for the care of an intact
      boy's penis. The current recommendation is that the foreskin
      be left undisturbed until the boy retracts the foreskin for
      himself.]</p>

      <p class="text2"><b>Circumcision and Cervical
      Cancer</b><br />
       Circumcision is only one of a large number of variables,
      many of them interrelated, which cannot be considered
      separately in epidemiologic studies of the etiology of cancer
      of the cervix. Factors shown to be associated with a high
      risk of cervical cancer include low socioeconomic status,
      early marriage, multiple marriages, extra marital relations,
      coitus at an early age, frequent coitus, non-use of
      contraceptives, syphilis and mulitparity.</p>

      <p class="text2">Boyd and Doll (1964) found the discovery
      rate of cancer of the cervix among non-Jewish women whole
      marital partners were circumcised to be no different from the
      rate among non-Jewish women with uncircumcised husbands.
      Jones et al. (1958) found the incidence of cancer of the
      cervix not to be related to the absence of circumcision in
      the spouse or other sexual partners. Circumcision was as
      common among the partners of a group of women with cervical
      cancer as among husbands of a control group of women.
      Khanolkar (1950) found the cervix to be site of origin of
      cancer more frequently in Moslem than Parsee women with
      cancer, although the husbands of the former are circumcised
      and those of the latter are not. The Parsee, on the other
      hand, attach greater importance to cleanliness. Elliot (1964)
      found English wives at the lower end of the socioeconomic
      scale to have a liability to cancer more than ten times
      greater than those at the top.</p>

      <p class="text2"><b>Circumcision and Cancer of the
      Penis</b><br />
       Apt (1960) found only 15 cases of cancer of the penis,
      scrotum and other male genital organs (excluding cancer of
      the prostate and testis) in Sweden; virtually none of
      Sweden&rsquo;s 3.7 million males are circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text2">Anna Munthodo (1961) recorded the incidence
      of carcinoma of the penis among Jamaicans and observed that
      over 50% of them had gonococcal infection, 55% had positive
      blood Wasserman reactions and 50% had positive
      complement-fixation tests for granuloma inguinale.</p>

      <p class="text2">The Javanese, like the Jews, regularly
      perform ritual circumcision, but Sampoerno, in a study
      referred to by Herskowitz, (1964) found seven carcinomas of
      the penis among 78 carcinomas of Javanese men.</p>

      <p class="text2">All 163 cases with cancer of the penis in
      Reddy&rsquo;s (1963) series of Indian men belonged to the low
      income group usually credited with low personal and genital
      hygiene Dodge and Kaviti (1965) among the rate of carcinoma
      of the penis among uncircumcised East African tribes to vary
      considerably and conceded that unexplored differences in
      personal hygiene may be responsible. Lenowitz and Graham
      (1946) found that cancer of the penis was five times more
      common in American Negroes than in American Whites, but skin
      cancer was seven times more common in whites.</p>

      <p class="text2">Carcinoma of the penis us uncommon in
      uncircumcised men with a high standard of hygiene, as in
      Sweden, but circumcision affords little protection in
      populations where personal hygiene may be minimal. In cases
      of penile carcinoma, lack of hygiene is always striking. If
      the uncircumcised male has a foreskin which he can retract
      and which he keeps clean, the risk of this cancer is
      removed.</p>

      <p class="text2">According to Burger and Guthrie (1977), the
      risk of developing carcinoma of the penis is probably no
      greater than the risk of a major complication of
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2"><b>Circumcision and Infection</b><br />
       Although there is a common belief that the circumcised man
      runs a lessened risk of venereal infection, particularly
      syphilitic, there are few figures to support this. Lloyd and
      Lloyd (1934), who reviewed the published evidence and
      analyzed their own figures, concluded that circumcision did
      not diminish the chance of syphilitic chancre. Schrek and
      Lenowitz (1947) found that hospital patients gave a history
      of venereal disease equally often whether circumcised or
      not.</p>

      <p class="text2"><b>Complications of Circumcision</b><br />
       Circumcision, like any other operation, is subject to the
      risk of hemorrhage and sepsis and where a general anaesthetic
      is used, to the risk of anaesthetic death. Haemorrhage is the
      most common immediate complication. It may be caused by
      inadequate haemostasis, blood coagulopathies, or the
      existence of anomalous vessels. Patel (1966) studied 100
      consecutive male infants who were circumcised at birth and
      who were revaluated 6 to 18 months later. He found 35
      instances of haemorrhage, of which four required sutures.</p>

      <p class="text2">Infection is also fairly common.
      Occasionally, infection may lead to more serious
      complications such as partial necrosis of the penis, or it
      may be a source of septicemia. Shulman et al. (1964) have
      recorded a case of staphylococcal septicemia giving rise to
      osteomylitis of the femur, and a fatal case of septicemia and
      pulmonary abscesses, both of which ascribed to infection of
      circumcision wounds.</p>

      <p class="text2">A common complication of circumcision is
      loss of penile skin. This can result from pulling too much of
      the skin from the shaft up over the glans during the
      operation. The remaining skin slides back, leaving a denuded
      penile shaft. Major losses of penile skin using occur,
      however, because of a complicating infection, the use of the
      electrocautery, or improper surgical technique.</p>

      <p class="text2">Additional complications include accidental
      lacerations of penile or scrotal skin, or both, incomplete
      circumcision with formation of adhesions and secondary penile
      deformity, accidental amputation of the glans with secondary
      post-operative haemorrhage, and retraction of the penis into
      a subcutaneous position by contraction, healing and fibrosis
      of the circular wound.</p>

      <p class="text2">Delayed complications of circumcisions are
      related to the newly circumcised penis being in frequent and
      prolonged contact with faeces and ammoniacal urine. Meatal
      stenosis, and its symptoms of dysuria, increased urinary
      frequently and enuresis, is a late complication. The
      appearance of this condition indicates the fallacy of the
      argument that boys should be circumcised at birth so they
      will have &ldquo;no trouble in later life&rdquo;. In
      Patel&rsquo;s series of 100 newborn circumcised bys who were
      examined at 6 to 18 months later, 31 developed meatal ulcers,
      8 had meatal stenosis and 8 had developed infections.</p>

      <p class="text2"><b>Functions of the Prepuce</b><br />
       It is often stated that the prepuce is a vestigal structure
      devoid of function. However, it seems no accident that during
      the years when the child is incontinent, the glans is
      completely clothed by the prepuce, for, deprived of this
      protection, the glans becomes susceptible to injury from
      contact with sodden clothes or nappy.</p>

      <p class="text2">Meatal ulcer is almost confined to
      circumcised male infants and is only occasionally seen in the
      uncircumcised child when the prepuce is unusually lax and the
      glans consequently is exposed. (Freud, 1947).</p>

      <p class="text2">In the adult, the function of the prepuce is
      to protect the glans, the latter being almost insensitive to
      ordinary tactile and thermal stimuli. <span class="yellow">It
      has however, specific receptors to other pleasurable
      sensations.</span> Removal of the prepuce exposes the glans
      to foreign stimuli which dull those special receptors.</p>

      <p class="text2"><b>Alternative to Circumcision</b><br />
       In cases of true phimosis, a simple dorsal slit of the
      foreskin would seem to permit the advantages of circumcision
      while avoiding many of the potential problems. Aesthetically,
      this gives a very satisfactory result.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: Phimosis now is being treated
      medically with topical steroid ointment. The surgical
      alternative is the limited dorsal slit <i>with tranverse
      closure</i>. Circumcision is contraindicated due to pain,
      trauma, risks, and loss of sexual and erogenous
      functions.]</p>

      <p class="text2"><b>Technique</b><br />
       An attempt is made to retract the prepuce and clean the
      corona. If this is not possible after adhesions have been
      broken down it may be necessary to perform the dorsal slit in
      the first instance. The slit is carried back far enough to
      allow easy retraction. Haemostatis is secured and a fine cat
      gut suture is used to approximate the skin and mucosa. An
      oplle dressing is applied and the mother is instructed to
      retract the foreskin daily for about two weeks and at
      frequent intervals afterwards.</p>

      <p class="text2"><b>Conclusion</b><br />
       It has been shown that since during the first few years of
      life the prepuce is still in the process of developing, it is
      impossible to determine in which infants it will attain
      normal retractibility. In fact, only about 10% fail to attain
      this by three years. Of these, it will be found a simple
      matter to render the prepuce retractable by completing the
      separation from the glans by gentle manipulation. In a very
      few this may prove to be impossible, usually because of
      phimosis, and a dorsal slit is then indicated.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The previous paragraph does not
      contain current recommendations for the care of an intact
      boy's penis. The current recommendation is that the foreskin
      be left undisturbed until the boy retracts the foreskin for
      himself.]</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The prepuce of the
      young infant should therefore be left in its natural
      state.</span> As soon as it becomes retractable, which will
      generally occur sometime between nine months and three years,
      its toilet should be included in the routine of bath time and
      soap and water applied to it in the same fashion as to other
      structures such as the ears, which are customarily treated
      with special assiduousness on account of their propensity to
      retain dirt. As the boy grows up, he should be taught to keep
      his prepuce clean himself just as he is taught to wash his
      ears. If such a procedure became customary, the circumcision
      of children would become an uncommon operation.</p>
