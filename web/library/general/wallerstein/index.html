      <h2>Circumcision: The Uniquely American Medical Enigma</h2>
      &nbsp; 

      <h3>Edward Wallerstein*</h3>

      <p><small>*Author of <i>Circumcision: An American Health
      Fallacy</i></small></p>

      <p class="text2">The continuing practice of routine neonatal
      nonreligious circumcision represents an enigma, particularly
      in the United States. <span class="yellow">About 80 percent
      of the world's population do <i>not</i> practice
      circumcision, nor have they ever done so. Among the
      non-circumcising nations are Holland, Belgium, France,
      Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Scandinavia, the U.S.S.R.,
      China, and Japan.</span> People employing circumcision do so
      either for "health" reasons or as a religious ritual
      practiced by Muslims, Jews, most black Africans, non-white
      Australians, and others.</p>

      <p class="text2">The origin of the ritual practice is
      unknown. There is evidence of its performance in Israel in
      Neolithic times (with flint knives) at least 6000 years
      ago.<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup></font>
      Jews accept the Old Testament origin as a covenant between
      God and Abraham,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n19">18</a></sup></font> although it is generally
      agreed that the practice of circumcision in Egypt predated
      the Abrahamic Covenant by centuries.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n55">55</a></sup></font> Ritual Circumcision is not
      germane to this discussion except insofar as the surgical
      ritual impinges upon accepted medical practice.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n65">65</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">So called "health" circumcision originated
      in the nineteenth century, when most diseases were of unknown
      etiology. Within the miasma of myth and ignorance, a theory
      emerged that masturbation caused many and varied ills. It
      seemed logical to some physicians to perform genital surgery
      on both sexes to stop masturbation; the major technique
      applied to males was circumcision. This was especially true
      in the English-speaking countries because it accorded with
      the mid-Victorian attitude toward sex as sinful and
      debilitating.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n64">64</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">The most prolific enumerator of the health
      benefits of circumcision was Dr. P. C. Remondino.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n50">50</a></sup></font> In 1891 this
      physician claimed that the surgery prevented or cured about a
      hundred ailments, including alcoholism, epilepsy, asthma,
      enuresis, hernia, gout, rectal prolapse, rheumatism, kidney
      disease, and so forth. Such ludicrous claims are still
      disseminated and possibly believed. The book was reprinted in
      1974, without change, and the <i>Circulating Branch
      Catalogue</i> of the New York Public Library (1983) listed
      the Remondino book, showing a publication date of 1974. One
      physician, writing in <i>Medical Aspects of Human
      Sexuality</i> (1974), called the book "pertinent and
      carefully thought out."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n63">63</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">Remondino was not the only one expounding
      such views. In 1911, Dr. Joseph Preuss, in a monumental tome,
      <i>Biblical-Talmudic Medicine</i>, claimed that Jewish ritual
      circumcision endowed health benefits; his sole source was
      Remondino<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n46">46</a></sup></font> Some espoused more extreme
      views; in 1910 an article in J.A.M.A. described a new
      circumcision clamp. The author/inventor claimed that with
      this device, the operation was so simple that men and women
      could now circumcise themselves.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">In the 75-year period (1875 to 1950) there
      was virtually no opposition to routine circumcision in the
      United States. Instead there were many articles in medical
      journal and textbooks extolling the practice; the issue was
      ignored in the popular press. Yet in the more than a century
      of acceptance of routine circumcision in the English-speaking
      countries, from 1870 to the present, no other country adopted
      newborn circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">The first serious questioning of the
      practice did not occur until late 1949 (in England with the
      publication of <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Gairdner"
      target="_blank">Gairdner</a>'s "<a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">The Fate of the
      Foreskin</a>."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n17">17</a></sup></font> which began to affect the
      practice of circumcision by the British. In 1963, an
      editorial in J.A.M.A. called the attitude of the medical
      profession paradoxical and confused, and admitted that the
      facts about circumcision were still unknown.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup></font> This was
      followed by several critiques of circumcision such as those
      by Morgan (<a href="/library/general/morgan/">1965</a> and <a
      href="/library/general/morgan2/">1967</a>)<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n38">38</a></sup></font> and Preston
      (<a href="/library/general/preston/">1970</a>).<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n45">45</a></sup></font> In 1968 <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">&Oslash;ster</a> confirmed
      Gairdner's findings,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n42">42</a></sup></font> as did Reichelderfer and
      Fraga,<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n49">49</a></sup></font>
      who presented a comprehensive study of circumcision. Yet some
      physicians continued to support circumcision for surprising
      reasons. For example, Dr. Robert P. Boland, writing in <i>The
      New England Journal of Medicine</i> in 1969, compared
      circumcision with tonsillectomy, calling both procedures
      "ritualistic," and "widely performed on a non-scientific
      basis." He opposed routine tonsillectomy but concluded
      vis-a-vis circumcision: "Little serious objection can
      actually be raised against circumcision since its adverse
      effects seem miniscule."<font size="2"><sup><a

      <p class="text2">In the 1970's, a change seemed in the
      offing. In 1971 and 1975, the American Academy of Pediatrics
      Task Force on Circumcision declared: "...there are no valid
      medical indications for circumcision in the neonatal
      period."<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></font>
      In 1978, the position of the American Academy of Pediatrics
      was endorsed by The American College of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n64">64</a></sup></font> In 1983 both groups jointly
      reaffirmed their positions.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup></font> The "firm" firm declarations
      should have caused a marked drop in the United States
      circumcision rate. They did not.</p>

      <p class="text2">To explore the circumcision rate in the
      United States, it is essential to compare the American
      experience with the other English-speaking countries.
      Anticircumcision articles appeared in the medical press in
      all of these countries. <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a><font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></font> and <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">&Oslash;ster</a><font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n42">42</a></sup></font> were
      published in journals in England; <a
      href="/library/general/morgan2/">Morgan</a> (1967) was
      published in Australia.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n39">39</a></sup></font> In 1971, the Australia
      Paediatric Association recommended: "Male infants should not
      as a routine be circumcised."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n13">13</a></sup></font> In 1975, the Canadian
      Paediatric Society stated, ". . .there is no medical
      indication for circumcision in the neonatal period."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n57">57</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">Although there is no precise data on
      circumcision from any country,approximated rates for the
      English-speaking countries reveal that in Great Britain, the
      practice has virtually been abandoned; New Zealand follows
      closely behind. (In a 1982 visit, a number of physicians were
      apologetic for the "inordinately high" rate of 10 percent.
      Several physicians stated categorically that they refused to
      perform routine circumcisions.) The rates in Canada and
      Australia appear to be declining at about 10 percentage
      points per decade. The United States stands alone as the only
      country in the world in which the majority of newborn males
      are circumcised, purportedly for health reasons.</p>

      <p class="text2">Before addressing the phenomenon of
      circumcision in the United States let us examine the Canadian
      and Australian data. In Canada (Table 2), there are
      considerable rate differences among the provinces but the
      overall rate is clearly declining, and in Quebec the practice
      has been virtually been discontinued. In Australia (Table 3),
      unlike Canada, the rates by states are relatively uniform,
      but clearly declining. In 1978, the Australia government
      recommended that payments for circumcision be reduced or
      eliminated.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n71">71</a></sup></font> (In a visit to Australia in
      1982, I was told that a national campaign was planned to
      reduce unnecessary surgery; circumcision was high on the
      list.)</p>

      <p class="text2">Although nationwide data on circumcision for
      Canada and Australia are admittedly imperfect, precise data
      for the United States are virtually non-existent. The H.E.W.
      <i>Hospital Records Study</i> excludes neonates.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n70">70</a></sup></font> The <i>Cycle
      III Health Examination Survey</i>, conducted from 1963 to
      1965 among youths aged 12 to 17, reflected the practice of
      circumcision in the early 1950's.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n70">70</a></sup></font> The total circumcision rate
      was 765 (whites, 80 percent; blacks, 45 percent); regional
      differences were also noted.</p>

      <p class="text2">In 1980 Wallerstein provided a crude
      compendium of circumcision rates reported in the
      literature.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n64">64</a></sup></font> This was updated in 1981 by
      King and Roebuck.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup></font> Since these compendia, other
      reports from individual hospitals have been noted in the
      literature (Table 4).<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n25">25</a></sup></font> Of the five hospitals
      reporting, the lowest rate was 80.7 percent; the other rates
      ranged from 90 to 98 percent. These data are static, that is,
      reported within a fixed period, making it impossible to
      discern a trend. Several hospitals reported longitudinal
      changes. One New York City maternity center stated that "in
      the past" the rate was 90 percent; in 1980 it was 60
      percent.[35] Other reports are more precise, indicating
      changes from 1978 to 1980, and 1975 to 1979 (Table 4, last
      two hospitals).<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></font> The year-to-year changes were
      negligible; clearly there was no precipitous decline. This
      stability of rate was confirmed by the Commission on
      Professional and Hospital Activities, which publishes annual
      data based on projections from atypically large
      hospitals.<font size="2"><sup><a

      <p class="text2">In 1982 Slatkowski and King approached the
      question of circumcision rates specifically with respect to
      the pronouncements of the American Academy of Pediatrics on
      the practice of circumcision in Illinois.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n54">54</a></sup></font> They
      obtained data from 18 Chicago-area hospitals; the rates
      ranged from 27 to 92 percent (mean 78 percent). Five of the
      hospitals reported rates from 80 to 88 percent; five from 90
      to 92 percent; the rates ranged from 74 to 97 percent, with a
      single exception: one hospital reported a rate of 4.5
      percent. Upon further query, that hospital reported a
      circumcision rate decline beginning after 1974-75.</p>

      <p class="text2">These United States data reveal no
      significant national decline in the circumcision rate
      desperate the pronouncements of the American Academy of
      Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists. However there are instances of sharp declines
      in several hospitals. Dr. Joan Hodgman, director of the
      Newborn Division of the Los Angeles County University of
      Southern California Medical Center, reported in 1983 that
      their circumcision rate is zero. <span
      class="yellow">Similarly, J.H.T. Chang, pediatric surgeon at
      the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, the largest in the
      city, stated in 1983 that circumcision is not performed even
      if the parents demand it.</span><font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n24">24</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">Why have most United States physicians
      persisted in the practice? One reason is that the medical and
      popular literature abounds in serious errors of scientific
      judgment, equivocation, and obfuscation. Space limitations
      permit a brief examination of four issues: pain, venereal
      disease, cancer, and hygiene.</p>
      <a id="pain" name="pain"></a> 

      <h3 class="center">PAIN</h3>

      <p class="text2">Pain of circumcision is not a debatable
      question; it is a fact.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup></font> However, a perusal of
      writings in the popular press (1982 and 1983) reveals
      confusion.</p>

      <p class="text2">Proctor and Gamble, one of the nations
      largest advertisers, promotes Pampers to parents by offering
      the <i>Expectant Parents Information Kit</i> (1982), which
      contains the following statement: "You may be surprised to
      learn that circumcision will not be painful to your baby
      because, at this early stage of development, the penis does
      not yet have functioning nerve endings."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">A contrary view was found in <i>American
      Baby</i> (May 1983), in which parents were told that
      "Newborns who undergo circumcision experience a great deal of
      stress and pain . . ." Parents were advised that it was now
      possible to employ local anesthetics to alleviate such
      pain.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n36">36</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Mother's Manual</i> (1982) argues against
      local anesthesia because ". . . it swells the area to the
      extent of making an unsatisfactory circumcision too
      likely."<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup></font>
      <i>Genesis</i>, published by the American Society for
      Psychoprophylaxis in Obstetrics, carried an article in 1982
      in which two writers who attended a Jewish ritual
      circumcision described the surgery as bloodless, painless and
      stressless. They suggested that non-Jewish parents explore
      the possibility of employing ritual circumcisors.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">Parents who read such an array of literature
      are bound to be bewildered.</p>
      <a id="std" name="std"></a> 

      <h3 class="center">VENEREAL DISEASE</h3>

      <p>Prior to the turn of the century, little was known about
      venereal disease, either causes or cures. Understandably, the
      false claim could be made with impunity that circumcision
      prevented sexually transmitted diseases.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n64">64</a></sup></font> These claims
      persisted beyond the middle of the twentieth century:
      Urologist A. Ravich titled his 1973 book <i>Preventing V.D.
      and Cancer by Circumcision</i>.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">Within the past decade there has been
      virtually no statement that circumcision prevents syphilis or
      gonorrhea; the present day "whipping boy" is genital herpes.
      Even a cursory exploration of a link between circumcision and
      herpes reveals that such claims are without foundation; the
      presence or absence of the foreskin neither aids nor deters
      the transmission of herpes. A definitive statement regarding
      this claim was made in 1979 by Y.M. Felman, director of the
      New York City Bureau of Venereal Disease Control: ". . . I
      don't believe that circumcision is of any value in preventing
      genital herpes, as this disease is quite common in
      circumcised males and their female sex partners."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">Yet in 1981, Warner and Strashin wrote:
      "Herpes genitalis appears to be the only sexually transmitted
      disease associated with circumcision status."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n67">67</a></sup></font> Strashin
      defended his statement the following year.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n68">68</a></sup></font> If
      circumcision prevents herpes or deters its transmission, how
      can we explain the phenomenal rise in the incidence of this
      disease to epidemic proportions, particularly among the most
      sexually active males, ages 15 to 25, of whom perhaps 75
      percent are circumcised? Nevertheless, the 1975 American
      Academy of Pediatrics Task Force reported: "Adequate studies
      to determine the relationship between circumcision and the
      incidence of venereal disease have not been performed." This
      statement is obvious outdated.</p>
      <a id="cancer" name="cancer"></a> 

      <h3 class="center">PENILE CANCER</h3>

      <p class="text2">Few diseases strike greater fear than
      cancer, and no site is more potentially alarming to males
      than the penis. It is not surprising, therefore that when
      newborn circumcision is presented as an absolute prophylaxis
      against penile carcinoma, it is a potent argument for
      circumcision. Wolbarst wrote in 1932: ". . . cancer of the
      penis does not occur in Jews circumcised in infancy. There is
      no case on record."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n73">73</a></sup></font> Subsequent research indicate
      that there are such cases on record.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">The understatement of the incidence of
      penile cancer in Jews should be contrasted with the
      overstatement in regard to the uncircumcised people of India
      and China. In 1973, deKernion and colleagues wrote: ". . .
      the disease accounts for 12 percent of all malignancies among
      the Hindus of India."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n12">12</a></sup></font> In 1977 Kaplan claimed, "In
      China, penile carcinoma accounts for 18 percent of all
      carcinomata."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup></font> In a visit to the Peoples
      Republic of China (1976) and India (1982) the incidence of
      penile cancer was discussed with health officials. They
      stated that no nationwide health data was available; more
      specifically, no National Cancer Registries were maintained
      (much as they would like to do so). They remarked that no
      reputable scientist in their country would provide such
      data.</p>

      <p class="text2">Precise data on penile cancer are available
      from countries in which a National Cancer Registry is
      maintained. The United States does not maintain such a
      Registry, and so its data are imprecise. The data from Japan,
      Norway, and Sweden are compared with the United States'
      estimates (Table 5). The largest difference in incidence is
      between the United States and Sweden, three cases per million
      males; for death rates, the difference between the United
      States and Japan is one case per million males, small
      differences indeed. It is worthy of note that in countries in
      which a National Cancer Registry is maintained and precise
      incidence or death rates is known, routine circumcisions
      continues <i>not</i> to be practiced. There is no acceptance
      of the claimed epidemiologic relationship between
      circumcision and penile cancer.</p>

      <p class="text2">It could be argued that in Japan, Norway,
      Sweden, high standards of hygiene are maintained. The
      variable in penile cancer prophylaxis may be hygiene, not
      retention of foreskin. This is essentially the position taken
      by the 1975 American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force, which
      denied a relationship between circumcision and prostatic
      cancer and stated that "non-circumcision is not of primary
      etiological significance" in cervical cancer.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></font> In regard to
      penile cancer, they wrote: "There is evidence that carcinoma
      of the penis can be prevented by neonatal circumcision. There
      also is evidence that <i>optimal</i> hygiene confers as much
      or nearly as much protection" (emphasis added)<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></font> In 1981, 6
      years later, Grossman and Posner took a more forthright
      position. Writing in <i>Obstetrics and Gynecology</i>, they
      stated: "No one today seriously promotes circumcision as a
      prophylactic against cancer in any form. No significant
      correlation between cancer and circumcision has ever been
      proved."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">The claim that circumcision is related to
      penile cancer is based upon the "fact" that smegma is a
      carcinogen. Smegma in infancy consists solely of desquamated
      epithelial cells, and in adulthood additionally of the
      secretions of the Tyson's glands. Many attempts have been
      made to prove a simple cause and effect between smegma and
      cancer; all failed but one. In 1947 Plaut and Kohn-Speyer
      "demonstrated" that smegma was a carcinogen. Of the animals
      examined, 27 percent of those treated with smegma developed
      cancer whereas 15 percent of the animals treated with cerumen
      developed cancer.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup></font> Is it now possible to claim
      that cerumen is also a carcinogen with only one half of the
      carcinogeneity of smegma? This study is deficient in
      conceptualization, methodology, execution, gathering of data,
      and analysis.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n44">44</a></sup></font> Understandably, the study has
      largely been ignored; however, as recently as 1981 it was
      accepted in one medical journal article without
      question.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">Penile cancer scare techniques are still
      with us. In 1980, Kochen and McCurdy stated that ". . .
      uncircumcised men are uniquely at risk . . ." They
      "demonstrated" that the predicted lifetime risk among
      uncircumcised men was one in 600.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n31">31</a></sup></font> They did not address why 599
      out of 600 at risk" males will not contract penile cancer in
      their lifetime. More importantly, Kochen and McCurdy based
      their calculations on the 1968 Stern and Lachenbruch study of
      one cancer detection center in Los Angeles.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup></font> Their 1968
      data are obviously skewed in age, ethnicity, religion, social
      class, and so forth, and are admittedly non-random. Such
      inadequate local data should not be extrapolated to a
      national statistic.</p>

      <p class="text2">The threat of penile cancer hangs over the
      discussion of circumcision like some mystical demon. It
      deserves to be exorcised, not circumcised. <a id="hygiene"
      name="hygiene"></a></p>

      <h3 class="center">PENILE HYGIENE</h3>

      <p class="text2">In several studies, mothers were asked why
      they agreed to their son's circumcision. The answer given
      most frequently was "hygiene."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n53">53</a></sup></font> (In a 1981 United Nations
      study of female genital surgery in Africa, one reason given
      for such surgery was "hygiene."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n19">19</a></sup></font>) Why is male genital hygiene
      viewed with such alarm in the United States that prophylactic
      surgical intervention is necessary?</p>

      <p class="text2">For over a century, and to this day, mothers
      have been warned that proper penile hygiene involves full
      retraction of the foreskin to clean the glans of smegma, and
      this procedure should start almost at day one. Such a task is
      virtually impossible, because in almost all infants the
      foreskin is attached firmly to the glans. Separation occurs
      normally within a few months or several years. Separation may
      be forced but this literally involves tearing the tissues
      apart, which is usually painful and may result in bleeding.
      No sane mother enjoys causing distress to her child. No
      wonder there is fear and reluctance about retraction of the
      foreskin. This has created a foreskin phobia. Forced
      retraction of the foreskin may lead to complications, and may
      well be the reason for so many postinfancy circumcisions
      (only in the United States).</p>

      <p class="text2">The problem with this hygienic technique is
      that it is totally in error. Care of the foreskin is not
      exceedingly difficult; it is exceedingly simple: leave it
      alone. The foreskin in infancy should not be retracted. In
      1977 Kaplan wrote, " . . . freeing 'adhesions is tantamount
      to cruel and unusual punishment and is unfounded
      physiologically or medically."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup></font> Development of the foreskin
      and the inadvisability of forced retraction was noted by <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a> (1949),<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></font> <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">&Oslash;ster</a> (1968),<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n42">42</a></sup></font>
      Reichelderfer and Fraga (1968),<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n49">49</a></sup></font> and others.</p>

      <p class="text2">Many, if not most, American physicians are
      ignorant of proper care of the foreskin. This was
      demonstrated by <a href="/library/hygiene/osborn1/">Osborn
      and colleagues</a> in 1981, who queried Utah pediatricians
      and found that 67 percent estimated that the foreskin should
      retract easily by one year.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n40">40</a></sup></font> This is contrary to all
      findings of studies of the foreskin. Only 3 percent said the
      newborn foreskin should never be retracted. In interviewing a
      small sample of mothers of uncircumcised boys, Osborn and
      colleagues also found that retraction of the foreskin caused
      such anxiety that 40 percent of these mothers stated that
      they would have their next male infant circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text2">The problem is not limited to Utah. In a
      study of physicians in the Chicago area, <a
      href="/library/procedure/dpatel/">Patel and colleagues</a>
      reported in 1982 that "only 49 percent of the physicians [in
      the total sample] were aware of the AAP's [American Academy
      of Pediatrics position."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n43">43</a></sup></font> Among the pediatricians and
      obstetricians in the sample, 62 percent were aware of this
      position. The major reason given for recommending
      circumcision was "hygiene" (90 percent). In a 1982 study by
      Stein and colleagues conducted in San Diego, they noted,
      "Only 36 percent of the responding physicians were aware that
      the newborn's foreskin is characteristically not found
      retractable."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n58">58</a></sup></font> When asked "if a
      nonretractable foreskin is an indication for circumcision,"
      47 percent of all respondents answered incorrectly. Such
      incorrect responses were mare likely to be given by those in
      family practice (50 percent), obstetrics (55 percent), and
      general practice (67 percent) than by those in pediatrics (13
      percent). At the Spring 1983 meeting of the American Academy
      of Pediatrics in Philadelphia, an exhibit on circumcision was
      conducted. The most frequently asked question related to
      proper care of the foreskin.</p>

      <p class="text2">If physicians are ill-informed about care of
      the foreskin, how can parents be well informed? There are
      thousands of books, pamphlets, and articles available to
      parents relating to child care. Almost none devotes attention
      to proper care of the foreskin. Discharging a circumcised
      child without informing the parents of proper wound care
      constituted negligence. Discharging an uncircumcised child
      without informing the parents of proper care of the foreskin
      is equally negligent.</p>

      <p class="text2">Osborn and colleagues reported that the only
      written information they could find on the subject was this
      statement in a 1978 book: " . . .retract the foreskin gently
      and return the foreskin to its normal position to prevent
      constriction and swelling."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup></font> To begin to correct this lack
      of information, in 1982 Wallerstein wrote a pamphlet entitled
      "When Your Baby Boy is Not Circumcised."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n66">66</a></sup></font> Boyce also
      addressed the subject in an article entitled "Care of the
      Foreskin (1983).<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup></font> The American Academy of
      Pediatrics has issued a pamphlet entitled "Care of the
      Uncircumised Penis" (1984).</p>

      <p class="text2">The issue of hygiene is obfuscated by the
      American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force Report in two ways.
      As noted earlier, the Report stated that to prevent penile
      cancer, "optimum hygiene was necessary. The reader, lay
      public or physician may ask: What constitutes "optimum
      hygiene? Can parents guarantee such optimum care? If not,
      isn't it better to play it safe and circumcise? The Report
      also cautions that retention of the foreskin requires
      "lifelong" hygiene. This statement is not incorrect; it is
      incomplete. All body parts require lifelong hygiene, body
      bathing, hair shampooing, oral hygiene, labial hygiene, and
      so forth. The discontinuance of any aspect of hygiene may
      well have deleterious effects. Why single out the
      foreskin?</p>

      <p class="text2">The crux of the circumcision/hygiene
      rationale had its origin in the fear of the "effects" of
      masturbation; this may persist in attenuated form. Today,
      however, it is basically a lack of knowledge: (1) the
      foreskin and glans in infancy are essentially fused, and
      should not be retracted forcibly, and smegma is not a
      carcinogen.</p>

      <p class="text2">Another claimed hygienic benefit is that
      thousands of United States servicemen, particularly in the
      South Pacific required circumcision. Would it not be better
      to circumcise in infancy and thereby avoid the more
      troublesome operation in adulthood? However, Japanese
      soldiers were fighting in the identical environment, and the
      Japanese did not practice newborn circumcision. When Japanese
      health officials were visited by Wallerstein (1982), they
      stated that to the best of their knowledge, Japanese military
      surgeons did not find it necessary to circumcise after World
      War II. More to the point, in the event of thermonuclear war,
      the role of the foreskin will pale to insignificance.</p>

      <p class="text2">Thus, much of the current circumcision
      misinformation, both lay and professional, is false and
      misleading. In 1971 and 1975, the American Academy of
      Pediatrics appeared to take definitive positions; actually
      they did not.</p>

      <p class="text2">The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee
      on the Fetus and Newborn noted in 1971 that "there are no
      valid medical indications for circumcision in the neonatal
      period."<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></font>
      in 1975, the American Academy of Pediatrics Ad Hoc Task Force
      on Circumcision reported that there was no basis for changing
      this statement and concluded, "There is no absolute medical
      indication for routine circumcision of the newborn."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">However, as previously noted, the use of the
      words "optimum" and "lifelong" with regard to to penile
      hygiene and the stated uncertainty of a possible link between
      circumcision and venereal disease represented equivocation.
      An additional equivocation is found in the 1975 Report: "A
      diagnosis of phimosis cannot be made with assurance in the
      newborn period because the cleavage plane between the glans
      and the deep preputial layer of the penis is not developed at
      birth. There is a real need for research which will improve
      diagnostic accuracy in this area."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">In 1983, this statement was challenged by
      Thompson, who chaired the ad hoc Committee. He wrote: "One
      major reason used to justify neonatal circumcision -
      correction or prevention of phimosis has been shown to be
      untenable by serial studies from birth to adulthood."<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n62">62</a></sup></font> Furthermore,
      overwhelming epidemiologic evidence from countries that never
      adopted circumcision or abandoned the practice obviates the
      need for further study.</p>

      <p class="text2">Thompson also provided the setting for the
      equivocation and the absence of a more definitive position:
      "The ad hoc commmittee was sharply divided in its opinions,
      and the resulting statement was a compromise that stated that
      there was no <i>absolute</i> medical indication for
      <i>routine</i> circumcision of the newborn.' The words
      <i>absolute</i> and routine were meant to convey a different
      impression from the conclusion of the AAP Committee on the
      Fetus and Newborn, but this has no always been the
      interpretation of readers."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n62">62</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">If the American Academy of Pediatrics
      Committee was sharply divided and the report subject to
      misinterpretation, how can physicians and parents take an
      unequivocal position on circumcision? They cannot. And if the
      position of the American Academy of Pediatrics is equivocal,
      the position of the American College of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists is even more so. When the American Academy of
      Pediatrics committees reported, the statements were
      published.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n56">56</a></sup></font> The endorsements of the
      American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were not
      published in their journal.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n64">64</a></sup></font> Moreover, in 1978 <a
      href="/library/general/grimes/">Grimes</a> raised an
      unanswered question: " . . . the American Board of Obstetrics
      and Gynecology, Inc., warns that 'physicians who assume
      responsibility for the health of male patients for operative
      or other care will not be regarded as specialists in
      obstetrics-gynecology . . .'"<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup></font> It is well known that
      obstetricians perform a large percentage of
      circumcisions.</p>

      <p class="text2">The acceptance of circumcision was noted by
      Herrera is 1983, who reported on a nationwide survey of 400
      pediatricians and obstetricians; 50 percent believed
      circumcision indicated in the newborn, 33 percent opposed,
      and 17 percent were undecided.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup></font> As to advice to parents,
      there was acquiescence; 15 percent encouraged it, 19 percent
      discouraged it, and 66 percent remained neutral. "This is one
      reason why nearly every male neonate is circumcised," Herrera
      wrote.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n26">26</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">Ambivalence on the part of physicians about
      circumcision was illustrated in one study by a Canadian
      hospital in 1983 where there were two patients with a serious
      complication of circumcision, denuding of the penile shaft
      that required plastic surgery. A formal proposal to suspend
      neonatal circumcisions was made but rejected because of
      anticipated adverse community reaction. However, the
      circumcision rate in that hospital dropped from about 40 to
      20 percent as a result of the mishaps.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n61">61</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">Judging from the record, American medical
      professionals are <i>not</i> truly opposed to circumcision;
      they perform about 1.25 million annually. Some continue to
      insist that there are health benefits. Some physicians place
      the responsibility on the parents. In 1983 Maisels and
      colleagues wrote, "If circumcision practices are ever to be
      changed, such changes will likely result from organized
      advocacy of lay groups . . . rather than from the efforts of
      the medical profession."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n34">34</a></sup></font> However when physicians
      demonstrated that routine tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy
      were unwise, the rate dropped. No amount of parental pressure
      would cause an ethical physician to perform such an operation
      if it were unnecessary.</p>

      <p class="text2">Some charge venality, possibly true for some
      physicians, but not for all, and impossible to document. Some
      of the highest circumcision rates are to be found in military
      hospitals, where the doctors are salaried. Contrast this with
      the abandonment of routine tonsillectomy; some physicians had
      reduced revenues, but no one clamored for the reinstatement
      of the procedure to refill the coffers. Venality may not be
      dismissed entirely; in private practice, circumcision results
      in a fee, and there is loss of time convincing parents not to
      have their sons circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text2">Then there is the Jewish question. Some
      non-Jewish physicians may be hesitant to question routine
      "health" circumcision in the mistaken belief that this stance
      may offend Jews. However, according to Jewish theologians,
      the Jewish ritual has nothing to do with health.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n64">64</a></sup></font> Obversely,
      occasional private comments suggest that Jews are responsible
      for nonreligious circumcision. This is a canard.</p>

      <p class="text2">The "enigma" lies in the United States
      medical profession's apparent inability to come to grips with
      the simple fact that there are no demonstrable health
      benefits of circumcision, and there are risks. (Space
      limitations preclude delineation.) It should also be noted
      that the foreskin is useful erogenous, and protective tissue.
      Smegma, both clitoral and penile, is beneficial, not
      detrimental. Meatitis is not uncommon in circumcised males;
      rare in the uncircumcised. Moreover, the penis is the only
      organ subjected to routine prophylactic surgery.</p>

      <p class="text2">One explanation for holding to outmoded
      views was provided by a medical professor who told his
      students, "It takes less than five minutes to print an
      article in a medical journal and 50 years to erase it." In
      1979 Colletti approximated this estimate. He noted that
      efforts to reverse current circumcision practice "will need
      at least a generation of widespread education, coaxing, and
      encouragement to succeed."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></font> Warner and Strashin are even
      more pessimistic, based upon an erroneous premise: "As for
      the likelihood of a successful hygiene education program we
      can only point to our own profession's impotence in combating
      smoking and obesity."<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n68">68</a></sup></font> This approach overlooks the
      fact that hundreds of millions of dollars are expended
      annually to promote smoking and food intake. No such effort
      on behalf of circumcision exists.</p>

      <p class="text2">As scientific evidence mounted to dispute
      each of Remondino's exaggerated claims, physicians clutched
      at straws to retain at least one "health" benefit. Now that
      all such claims have been refuted, circumcision today has
      become cultural surgery, not very different from ear- and
      nose-piercing and tattooing. The extreme to which such
      cultural surgery is carried may be found in the 1983 warning
      given by the British Social Service Secretary to Harley
      Street surgeons who charged up to $1500 for a clitoridectomy
      performed on young girls from Africa, where such surgery is
      traditional.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n69">69</a></sup></font> More serious examples were
      found in France in 1982.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n52">52</a></sup></font></p>

      <p class="text2">The medical profession was successful in
      eliminating routine tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. This is
      precisely what is needed for routine circumcision. It is
      necessary to overcome ignorance and the emotional
      superstructure surrounding the penis, not very different from
      ancient (and present phallic worship. It is necessary to
      accept scientific facts; it is necessary to discard myths
      about circumcision: the foreskin causes premature
      ejaculation, it keeps the penis from growing, some disaster
      will befall the uncircumcised child, the uncovered glans is
      more esthetically pleasing (that is the foreskin is ugly).
      The special myth that the boy's penis must be identical to
      his father's ignores the historic truth that no objection was
      raised, and no problem arose when circumcising millions of
      boys whose fathers were uncircumcised.</p>

      <p class="text2">To resolve the problem, the positions of the
      American Academy of Pediatrics and American College of
      Obstetricians and Gynecologists should become definitive
      statements that circumcision is unnecessary surgery, not to
      be undertaken except in rare medical circumstances.
      Endorsements of this position should be obtained from all
      relevant medical groups. This information should be
      disseminated to the entire medical profession, to all
      hospitals, nurses and nursing associations, childbirth
      educators, and most certainly to parents via the popular
      press. Meetings of professional and lay persons should be
      called on local, state and national levels to discuss
      circumcision. With such an approach, routine newborn
      nonreligious circumcision will soon pass from the scene to
      join blood-letting and cupping in medical history.</p>

      <p class="text2">As Prucha observed in 1980, "The history of
      these few millimeters of skin is utterly fascinating."<font
