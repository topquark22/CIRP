      <h2>Circumcision in Germany</h2>

      <p class="ed">Editorial comments</p>

      <p><b>S. Hoffman-von Kap-herr</b></p>

      <p class="address">Klinik- u. Poliklinik f&uuml;r
      Kinderchirugie, Mainz, Federal Republic of Germany</p>

      <p class="init">Phimosis has long been a subject of
      controversy, as it is a point where medical and ritualistic
      schools of thought intermingle and lead to deliberation as to
      whether, when, and how circumcision should be performed in
      boys. It is thus understandable that there is no uniform
      opinion in the German-speaking countries.</p>

      <p class="text">Only the medical indications for circumcision
      need concern the physician, of course, since this is a
      surgical procedure that like any other operation is
      <span>legally regarded as bodily injury</span> and requires
      the parents' consent.</p>

      <p class="text">The majority of pediatric surgeons in our
      area, while not doubting the existence of true medical
      indications, reject the routine practice of circumcision in
      newborns despite cognizance of the apparently weighty
      arguments such as the allegedly higher incidence of penile
      and cervical carcinomas associated with uncircumcised men.
      <span class="yellow">These arguments are essentially
      thinly-veiled justifications for prophylactic circumcision,
      however, and are not accepted by most of us.</span> The
      correctness of this silent opposition is being confirmed by
      the slow but increasing changes in practice in the United
      States, where for decades circumcision was carried out
      totally uncritically as a "cultural ritual;" <span
      class="yellow">currently efforts are underway to do away with
      this nonsense</span> (e.g. <a
      href="http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/abstract/80/2/215"
       target="_blank">Brown, MS, Brown CA</a> (1987), Pediatrics
      80: 215-219).</p>

      <p class="text">The problem of circumcision in the newborn
      period or at any other set time is thus obviated; when
      medical indications are present, the procedure will be
      performed regardless of age, assuming that the physiologic
      adhesion of the prepuce in newborns and infants is
      understood. <span>Manipulation of the prepuce in this age
      group to free it and ostensibly allow cleansing of the glans
      inevitably leads to fine fissures in the delicate membranes
      with subsequent circular scarring that may later necessitate
      operation.</span> As the foreskin slowly becomes
      spontaneously detached around the 3rd to 4th year of life,
      only at this time can the rare congenital phimosis or that
      due to retraction or inflammation be diagnosed. Both, of
      course, represent true medical indications for circumcision
      and require surgical correction.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: When Dr. Hofmann-von Kap-herr
      prepared this comment, he lacked access to later research
      into the normal development of the prepuce. We now understand
      from the research of <a href="/library/normal/kayaba/">Kayaba
      <i>et al.</i></a> that the growth and development of the
      prepuce continues into adult life. Consequently, phimosis
      cannot be diagnosed until well after puberty.]</p>

      <p class="text">Recurrent balanitis, voiding problems
      (distension of the prepuce during micturition in infants), or
      paraphimosis are the most important findings in setting the
      indication for surgery. This may occur long before the 3rd
      year of life, or later during school age..</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: Dr. Hofmann-von Kap-herr
      considered distention of the prepuce (ballooning) to be a
      medical indication for circumcision. We now know, however,
      that this is a normal developmental transient condition. It
      occurs after the prepuce separates from the glans and before
      the opening of the prepuce has grown larger. It no longer is
      regarded as in indication for circumcision. Similarly,
      paraphimosis does not require circumcision, only that the
      prepuce be returned to its normal position. Balanitis is
      properly treated by accurate diagnosis of the cause with
      smear and culture and/or biopsy followed by the treatment
      indicated by the diagnosed cause.]</p>

      <p class="text">Although these considerations are more or
      less accepted by most pediatric surgeons in central Europe,
      the surgical method of choice remains controversial. The
      classical technique of circumcision, with or without aids
      such as the plastic bell, etc., is preferred by more
      urologically oriented pediatric surgeons and adult-urologists
      who also operate on children. The remaining pediatric
      surgeons resect only as much of the foreskin as is necessary
      to prevent recurrence of the phimosis. In this method, which
      is also favored in my clinic, the inner preputial membrane
      along with any scar tissue is resected at its junction with
      the outer membrane, and the latter is then fixed to the
      corona glandis. There is usually sufficient foreskin
      remaining to cover three-fourths to all of the glans
      postoperatively, but good retractability must always be
      achieved..</p>

      <p class="text">Although we are aware that the philosophy of
      this method is just as open to criticism as the reasoning
      behind total circumcision, we feel more at ease with a glans
      penis that is surgically "protected" rather than "stark
      naked" postoperatively..</p>

      <p class="text">Interestingly enough, mothers tend to request
      total circumcision only when the child's father is totally
      circumcised; otherwise they feel it is important that as
      little skin as possible be removed. Occasionally parents
      whose son had total circumcision have sought cosmetic surgery
      to reconstruct the original condition, which is unfortunately
      impossible..</p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">Decreased sensitivity
      and injuries to the vaginal mucosa due to coarseness of the
      glans have actually been described following total
      circumcision.</span> The partially resected prepuce does
      require higher hygienic standards, but offers a better
      cosmetic appearance, at least from the viewpoint of our
      society.</p>

      <p class="text">Be that as it may: phimosis is a popular bone
      of contention at pediatric surgical meetings and is likely to
      remain so. As is true in many fields, the controversy
      revolves around a paltry few millimeters!.</p>

      <p class="text">In summary, <span class="yellow">it is
      certain that prophylactic circumcision is unnecessary</span>
      in our climatic zones if training in normal genital hygiene
      is carried out. Inflammatory scarring and genuine congenital
      phimosis, however, are always indications for operation.
      <span class="yellow">Both mother and child are most satisfied
      when the prepuce still adequately covers the glans.</span> In
      this regard, perhaps it is appropriate to speak of a
      fashion?!.</p>
