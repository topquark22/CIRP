        <p><b>SYNOPSIS</b></p>
      </center>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="notes">The results of 200 circumcisions are
        presented, together with a discussion of the indications
        and subsequent complications.</p>

        <p class="notes">A review of the literature suggests that
        many of the traditional indications remain unproven.</p>

        <p class="notes"><span class="yellow">In the light of this
        study, and other surveys which indicate the hazards of the
        operation, it is suggested that circumcision should be
        confined to those with a genuine medical
        indication.</span></p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <div class="CIRP">
          <p>[CIRP historical note: This article played a part in
          turning Australia away from infant circumcision. The year
          after this article was published, the Australian College
          of Paediatrics issued a statement that baby boys should
          not be routinely circumcised.</p>

          <p>This article disproved the medical myth (started by
          Abraham Wolbarst in 1932) that circumcision "prevented"
          penile cancer. Independently, <a
          href="/library/general/preston/">Preston</a> in the
          United States also disproved the Wolbarst myth in the
          same year.</p>

          <p>The advice contained in this article from 1970 on the
          care of intact boys is not current advice, does not
          reflect the current state of medical knowledge. The
          intact foreskin should never be forcibly retracted; this
          can damage the penis and impede its development.]</p>
        </div>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision is a practice which originated
      in ancient Egypt (Bolande, 1969), since when the practice has
      spread to assume status as a ritualistic part of many
      religions. The original followers of those religions, Jews,
      Moslems, Australian Aborigines, all lived in hard dry arid
      conditions where the standard of personal hygiene was
      sub-optimal. Circumcision, therefore had appeal as a
      prophylactic measure against balanitis.</p>

      <p class="text2">Nowadays, in Australia, despite a state of
      enlightened civilization that average Australians are thought
      to enjoy, circumcision is still the rule. The exposed glans
      is the fashion. The undressed penis stands as a social
      symbol, and the foreskin is still a schoolboy's curiosity,
      viewed secretly with wonder and awe. Circumcision now
      performed as a social ritual, and those in favour of the
      operation have justified its performance on medical
      grounds.</p>

      <p class="text2">It has been said that circumcision is a
      simple operation with little associated morbidity and
      mortality, and that benefits include increased hygiene, and
      prophylaxis against malignancy.</p>

      <p class="text2">Opinion against the performance of the
      operation of circumcision is just as certain that if the
      foreskin is subjected to adequate toilet, carcinoma is not a
      problem, neither is balinitis.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the belief that the operation of
      circumcision is not without risk, it was decided to analyse
      some of the case records of circumcision performed at this
      Hospital to obtain statistics concerning the actual
      morbidity. Should a significant morbidity exist, then it
      seems obvious that there are no grounds for the present-day
      practice of social circumcision.</p>

      <h4 class="sect">MATERIALS AND METHODS</h4>

      <p class="text2">The case notes of 200 consecutive patients
      from the records of this hospital were studied to obtain such
      information as the indication, operation, method of
      controlling bleeding and the incidence of complications. The
      results were partially analysed by computer.</p>

      <h4 class="sect">RESULTS</h4>

      <p class="text2">The mean age of the patients in this survey
      was 2 years 4 months, the mean stay in Hospital 2 days, and
      the mean time on the waiting list was 2.1 months.</p>

      <p class="text2">While awaiting operation, 39 children
      developed some additional symptoms or sequelae. 10 developed
      ``difficulty in passing urine'' without ballooning the
      foreskin; in 5, the prepuce became non-retractile; 5
      developed an attack of balanitis which settled with
      conservative measures; 3 developed urinary obstruction
      necessitating advancement of the operation; 2 developed
      frequency of micturition; 2 had an episode of paraphimosis,
      and in one the indication for the operation disappeared, i.e.
      the penis prepuce became retractile. 10 other children had
      other complications, e.g. ``nappy rash,'' and one developed a
      urinary tract infection. There was a significant age
      distribution in the 10 patients who developed urinary
      difficulty; one was less than 1 year of age, no one was
      between 1 and 2 years of age, and 9 were over the age of 2
      years.</p>

      <h4>Stated Indications for Operation</h4>

      <p class="text2">These were obtained from the Outpatient
      records, and have been divided into 2 categories; medical and
      social (Table I). The prepuce was supposedly non-retractable
      in 102 out of the 200, i.e. 51%</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>The Social Indications</i> followed the
      pattern described in most reports on the subject. In most
      cases the operation was requested for reasons of conformity,
      supposed cleanliness, because it was more attractive, or
      because it was socially the ``done thing,'' In 2 cases the
      operation was advised by the family doctor because it was
      ``better to have it done now and got out of the way.'' One
      case was a Moslem child circumcised for religious
      reasons.</p>

      <h4>The Operation</h4>

      <p class="text2">In 150 cases this was simple primary
      circumcision. In 19 (9.5%), the operation was performed
      because an earlier circumcision had failed or been followed
      by complications.; 14 were circumcised as an encore to
      another elective surgical procedure. In 12 cases circumcision
      was performed for minimal hypospadias; 2 cases had a dorsal
      preputial slit followed by a circumcision for true phimosis;
      2 cases had freeing of congenital adhesions only, and in one
      case freeing of adhesions was performed before proceeding to
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">From these figures it appears that only 5 of
      the 102 cases diagnosed as being non-retractable were in fact
      non-retractable.</p>

      <p class="text2">Of those cases considered, before operation,
      to have phimosis or a non-retractable prepuce, 44 were more
      than 3 years of age and 23 of those were over 6 years
      old.</p>

      <h4>Complications</h4>

      <p class="text2">The incidence was rather high (Table II),
      and for convenience they have been analysed in 2 groups,
      early and late, according to whether they occurred before or
      after 2 weeks. <i>Late complications</i> occurred in 15
      (7.5%). One of the 2 cases of meatal stenosis eventually
      required a meatotomy; in one healing was delayed for 5 1/2
      weeks; and in 2, too little skin was removed at
      operation.</p>

</pre>
      </center>
      <hr size="1" />

      <p class="text2">The total complication rate was 31 in 200
      cases, i.e. 15.5%.</p>

      <p class="text2">In an attempt to evaluate these
      complications, several aspects were analysed. The first of
      these was the experience of the operator; surgeons had a
      complication rate of 14.9%, surgical registrars 17.6% and
      resident medical officers 50%. Perhaps this would not suffer
      statistical scrutiny, but it probably reflects the residents'
      lack of experience.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Haemorrhage</i> was the most common
      complication, and on clinical grounds was classified as mild,
      arterial or brisk venous haemorrhage as moderate, while
      clinical signs of blood loss and/or the need for transfusion
      were classified as severe. The procedures required to control
      this haemorrhage were also listed.</p>

      <p class="text2">Haemorrhage (early or late occurred in 14
      cases, 9 mild and 4 moderate; in one case the degree is not
      known, and there was no instance of severe hemorrhage.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the 9 cases with mild hemorrhage, 3
      ceased spontaneously, 3 required topical adrenaline, 3 were
      controlled by re-dressing and digital pressure, and in one
      case a dressing of tinc. benz. co. was applied. Of the 4
      cases of moderate haemorrhage, 3 required ligation of
      persistent bleeding points under a second general
      anaethestic, and in one a persistent bleeder was ligated in
      the ward without anaesthesia.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Meatal ulcer</i> was the second most
      common complication, and an attempt was made to correlate it
      with the type of dressing or any adjunct smeared on the glans
      after circumcision. It was assumed that management after
      circumcision was similar in most instances, and in fact the
      type of dressing used had no significant effect on the
      incidence of meatal ulcer.</p>

      <p class="text2">No adjunct was used in 74 cases and 3 (4%)
      developed a meatal ulcer. With ``KY Jelly,'' 2 out of 82
      (2.4% developed a meatal ulcer. The development of a meatal
      ulcer bore no significant relationship to the age of the
      patient.</p>

      <p class="text2"><i>Recircumcisions</i> constituted 19 (8.5%)
      of the 200 operations. These were patients who had been
      circumcised in the neonatal period for social reasons mostly,
      as far as could be ascertained, in other hospitals. 11 were
      recircumcised for phimosis occurring after routine
      circumcision; 7 were recircumcised for other reasons - mostly
      because too little skin had been removed at the first
      operation - and in many cases, the appearances suggested that
      circumcision had never been performed. One child developed
      paraphimosis which required emergency circumcision, reduction
      being otherwise impossible.</p>

      <p class="text2">Of 19 recircumcisions, 18 were simple
      circumcisions and in one a dorsal slit was followed by a
      circumcision. Complications followed in 3 patients, infection
      (one), meatal stenosis (one), and mild haemorrhage (one) a
      rate of 15.7% which is comparable to that of the series as a
      whole. Finally, analysis of the type of operation, and the
      month in which it was performed, showed that these had little
      effect on the complication rate.</p>

      <h4 class="sect">DISCUSSION</h4>

      <p class="text2">A multiplicity of reasons have been proposed
      for the performance of circumcision, and the variety of these
      only reflects the uncertainty and the emotional undertones
      that surround the whole subject. The reasons proposed can be
      conveniently subdivided into 3 categories.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The prevention of cancer, and/or better hygiene.</li>

        <li>Social or religious reasons</li>

        <li>Correction of definite abnormalities, whether
        congenital or acquired.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>1. The prevention of Cancer, and/or Better Hygiene</h4>

      <p class="text2">Increased incidence of carcinoma of the
      penis, the cervix uteri, and the prostate, have all been
      attributed to lack of circumcision. Plaut and Kohn-Speyer
      (1947), using cerumen as a control, introduced horse smegma
      into the a subcutaneous tube constructed on the back of
      several mice, and showed that smegma was weakly carcinogenic.
      Most other evidence on carcinoma is based on racial or ethnic
      difference.</p>

      <h5>(a) <i>Carcinoma of the Prostate</i></h5>

      <p class="text2">In a series of prostatectomies for
      prostatomegaly, Ravich (1942) noted an incidence of
      malignancy of 1.7% in Jewish males ritually circumcised some
      8 days after birth, compared with a rate of 20% for
      uncircumcised non-Jewish males. From this, it was deduced
      that circumcision decreases the incidence of prostatic
      carcinoma.</p>

      <h5>(b) <i>Carcinoma of the Cervix</i></h5>

      <p class="text2">Elliot (1964) reported that the incidence of
      carcinoma of the cervix is one-fifth to one-six as great in
      Jewish women as in the general population. Being a disease
      which is associated with a lower socio-economic status, the
      incidence declined in a survey period from 1910 to 1954,
      during which time socio-economic status and standards of
      personal hygiene are two factors which have risen
      conspicuously.</p>

      <p class="text2">Boldt (1959) and Hubert (1960) independently
      noted that the incidence of carcinoma of the cervix of women
      in Abyssinia was higher than, or comparable to, that in
      Europe and the U.S.A., even though 90% of Abyssinia males are
      ritually circumcised at birth.</p>

      <p class="text2">Weiss (1964) found that the disease is
      associated with poor socio-economic circumstances, sexual
      promiscuity, and early-childbearing, but was not affected by
      the use of a condom, which would presumably have a similar
      effect to circumcision in preventing the contact of smegma
      and cervix.</p>

      <p class="text2">Carcinoma of the cervix in India is most
      frequent in the Hindu women from Deccan (Khanolkar, 1950),
      and proportionally less in Moslem women. Circumcision before
      the age of 12 years is obligatory for Moslem males. In Hindu
      women from Gujarat, who enjoy a higher social standing and
      who are more fastidious about their personal hygience, the
      incidence is four-fifths that of Hindu women from Deccan.</p>

      <p class="text2">In Moslem women the incidence is two-fifths
      that of the Hindus' from Deccan.</p>

      <p class="text2">Carcinoma of the cervix seems to be
      associated with a multiplicity of aetiological factors, the
      most consistent being poor socio-economic circumstances and
      the related lack of personal hygiene.</p>

      <h5>(c) <i>Carcinoma of the Penis</i></h5>

      <p class="text2">Speert (1953) quoted the work of Wolbarst
      (1933) which showed that:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>(i) in a series of 1103 cases of carcinoma of the
        penis, there were no Jews, and;</li>

        <li>(ii) the greater frequency of carcinoma of the penis in
        uncircumcised Hindus compared with circumcised Moslems in
        India.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text2">Moslems are circumcised between the ages of
      4 and 12 years, and comparisons of the incidence in Moslems
      and Jews show a lower incidence in Jews, who are circumcised
      on the eight post-natal day. However, Jewish ritual demands
      the removal of more prepuce than the Moslem ritual.</p>

      <p class="text2">Carcinoma of the penis in the Chinese
      accounts for 18.5% of all carcinomata, compared with 2% in
      the U.S.A. (Ngai, 1933) There are wide geographic variations,
      and the disease is associated with a congenitally, tight, or
      a long redundant foreskin. The disease is rarely seen among
      the more well-to-do, whose level of personal hygiene is
      higher.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision has been thought to provide
      complete protection from carcinoma of the penis, but recently
      2 cases have been reported in Jews circumcised in infancy
      (Dean, 1936; Melmed and Pyne, 1964) and 5 cases of carcinoma
      of the penis in non-Jews circumcised in infancy. (Amclar,
      1956; Kauffman and Sternberg, 1963; Ledlie and Smithers,
      1956; Marshall, 1953); Pacquin and Pearce, 1955).</p>

      <p class="text2">In Australia , between 1960, between 1960
      and 1966, there were 78 deaths from carcinoma of the penis;
      in the same period that there were 2 recorded deaths from
      routine circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Carcinoma of the penis seems to be
      associated with lack of circumcision, which by no means
      affords absolute protection. Also associated are a long
      redundant, and a congenitally adherent foreskin, while good
      personal hygiene appears to decrease the incidence.</p>

      <p class="text2">In these three malignancies, it appears that
      more factors than simple circumcision and noncircumcision are
      involved, and those, personal hygiene seems to be the most
      consistently relevant.</p>

      <h4>2. Social or Religious Reasons</h4>

      <p class="text2">Bolande (1969) wrote that circumcision
      originated through imitation of the practices of a superior
      or revered individual in a society, and has now become
      established as a fashion perpetuated by the need to
      conform.</p>

      <p class="text2">MacCarthy et al. (1952) reported that 24% of
      children in the United Kingdom had been circumcised by the
      age of 4 years and 3 months. <a
      href="/library/procedure/patel/">Patel</a> (1966) noted an
      incidence of 48% at Kingston General Hospital, Canada, and
      Wall (1968), reported an overall incidence in the United
      States of 69-97%, Fredman (1969) in a survey in Victoria,
      Australia, found an incidence of 70%, most of the operations
      having been performed for reasons of family uniformity,
      Australian custom, aethetics, and so on.</p>

      <p class="text2">Two deaths from routine circumcision
      occurred in Australia during the period 1960-1966. Speert
      (1953) in a survey of the period 1939-1951 quoted one death
      in a series of 566,463 circumcisions, and 243 deaths from
      carcinoma of the penis during the same period.</p>

      <p class="text2">In England and Wales, between 1942 and 1947,
      16 children died <i>annually</i> as a result of routine
      circumcison (Begg, 1953, while Gairdner (1949) reported 16
      deaths in a series of 90,000 circumcisions, high mortality
      figures for a simple operation.</p>

      <p class="text2">Mortality aside, circumcision is accompanied
      by a considerable number of less serious complications
      (15.5%) including haemorrhage, meatal ulcer, meatal stenosis
      and infection in the series reported here. Other
      complications included laceration of the glans during
      operation, delayed wound healing, and ineffectual
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">A less serious delayed complication of
      circumcision is ammoniacal dermatitis causing a meatal ulcer
      and stenosis, a sequel which only occurs in the
      circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text2">Other less common but more serious
      complications not seen in this survey are urethral fistula,
      amputation of the glans, avulsion of the scrotum and
      septicaemia (<a href="/library/procedure/patel/">Patel</a>,
      1966).</p>

      <p class="text2">Severe haemorrhage, also absent from this
      series, may require tranfusion with its attendant occasional
      complications, or further surgical intervention with the
      possibility of an additional anaesthetic.</p>

      <p class="text2">Meatal stenosis may require a meatotomy, and
      the rarer severe complications may require elaborate plastic
      surgical procedures. A second operation because of the
      failure or complication of the first is not unusual and
      constituted 9.5% of this series.</p>

      <p class="text2">A circumcision, then, is an operation which
      is accompanied by a not inconsiderable risk which should be
      seriously considered when the operation is entertained.</p>

      <h4>3. The Correction of Abnormalities</h4>

      <p class="text2">The most common abnormality in this series
      seemed to be a non-retractable foreskin, and there seemed to
      be some uncertainty concerning this diagnosis.</p>

      <p class="text2">At birth, separation of the prepuce from the
      glans has not occurred in some 90% of males. The epidermis of
      the prepuce and glans is adherent until separated by a
      process of desquamation and before this has occurred the
      prepuce cannot be separated without difficulty.</p>

      <p class="text2"><a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a> (1949) studied
      retractability at different ages, and showed that only 4% of
      males have a fully retractable foreskin at birth, while at
      the age of 3 years it is fully retractable in all but 10%. <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">&Oslash;ster</a> (1968)
      extended the study and found that 8% of boys at the age of 6
      years and 1% at the age of 16 years, still have a
      non-retractable prepuce. &Oslash;ster also found significant
      amounts of smegma in 1% of uncircumcised 6 year old boys, and
      that smegma tended to increase after 12 or 13 years, so that
      8% of 16 year old boys had significant amounts.</p>

      <p class="text2">A prepuce made fully retractable after age
      of 3 years by simple separation of adhesions with a blunt
      probe, not necessarily under anaesthesia, would assist
      hygiene, decrease balanitis and true phimosis, and prevent
      the accumulation of smegma, thus deceasing the risk of
      carcinoma of the penis, possibly to an almost neglible
      level.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision is still necessary to correct
      genuine phimosis, and occasionally to alleviate that uncommon
      condition, paraphimosis. In this series paraphimosis was
      usually caused by an overzealous mother forcibly retracting,
      in the bath, a still congenitally adherent foreskin in a
      child less than 3 years of age, on the mistaken advice of a
      doctor. Surely this shows the need for proper education of
      those members of the medical profession most closely
      associated with those problems.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">With proper counseling,
      circumcision becomes an unnecessary operation, even more so
      when it is realized that the prepuce plays an important part
      in protecting the glans during the period of urinary
      incontinence in the first years of life.</span></p>

      <center>
        <h4 class="sect">CONCLUSIONS</h4>
      </center>

      <p class="text2">A study of 200 consecutive cases of
      circumcision has shown that:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Only 5 cases (of 102 diagnosed) actually had
        pathological phimosis at operation.</li>

        <li>The incidence of complications (15.5%) was probably a
        reflection of the diverse techniques and operators
        employed. Better results would no doubt be obtained iy all
        necessary circumcisions were performed by consultant
        surgeons or their equivalent.</li>

        <li>The type of operation does not seem to be overly
        important, except that it is probably more important, as in
        all surgery, that the operator be experienced in this
        technique and use a technique with which he is
        familiar.</li>

        <li>Finally, from a review of the recent literature and the
        results of this survey it is deduced that routine
        circumcision is largely unwarranted, and that adequate
        personal hygiene, possibly aided by making all foreskins
        retractable at the age of 3 years, has exactly the same
        effect as circumcision with none of the complications.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">We would recommend that
      Hospital waiting lists be unburdened of unnecessary routine
      circumcisions, and that if parents request the operation as a
      social ritual, it should be done in private, not public
      beds.</span></p>
