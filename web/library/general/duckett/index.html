      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: In this 1995 paper, Duckett calls
      on his fellow urologists to abandon their hardline advocacy
      of non-therapeutic child circumcision and to respect the
      parents' decision to protect the genital integrity of their
      child.]</p>

      <p>Unfortunately the rhetoric and emotion that engenders
      spirited debate over circumcision today will not likely be
      resolved with "the facts." The controversy seems to polarize
      a pro/con intransigence, the foundations of which are
      untenable for either position. There is a good review in an
      AUA Update Series,<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> which
      supports neonatal circumcision from the urologist's point of
      view. The avoidance of cancer of the penis and cancer of the
      cervix are always strongly argued positions. It has been
      pointed out that the moist glans is more susceptible to
      venereal disease and HIV infections. Devine has said, "If the
      decision is made not to circumcise a male infant, there must
      be a lifetime commitment to genital hygiene. This is the rub
      - penile hygiene is the key to penile health, circumcised or
      uncircumcised. Most opponents of circumcision must feel that
      every uncircumcised individual will take meticulous care of
      his penis as they seem to compare the benefits of
      circumcision with this ideal." He then sardonically implies
      that parents should have to sign an AAP medical alert. The
      decision not to circumcise a male infant must be accompanied
      by a lifetime commitment to genital hygiene to minimize the
      risk of developing penile cancer.</p>

      <p>Although penile cancer occurs in the uncircumcised, it is
      so rare in the United States that Marshall argued
      convincingly in 1960 (at a meeting of the Society for
      Pediatric Urology in Philadelphia) that someone would have to
      do 140 circumcisions a week for 25 years to prevent one case
      of carcinoma of the penis. Good hygiene and health awareness
      may serve the same goal.</p>

      <p>Blandy has pointed out that in 1949 16 deaths occurred in
      the United Kingdom in 1 year associated with neonatal
      circumcision from unrecognized clotting disorders or
      infection, prompting the United Kingdom to reverse its
      circumcision policy. He also noted a humane provision in the
      Talmud, excusing a third son from circumcision if two
      previous sons have died from it.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> A proper informed consent might
      include a list of complications of circumcision: excessive
      bleeding, necrosis of the glans, removal of the penile skin,
      urethral fistula, lymphedema, laceration of the scrotum,
      staphylococcal septicemia, penile necrosis, and even
      hematogenous osteomyelitis. Aspiration complications in
      babies without anesthesia are also reported. At a recent
      meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Horowitz and
      Glassberg<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> reported on
      "Circumcision: Successful Glanular Reconstruction and
      Survival Following Traumatic Amputation." There were 7 cases
      in 8-day-old infants all done by a different mohel in New
      York City. A straw poll of the pediatric urologists in the
      audience indicated at least half had similar cases.</p>

      <p>Those advocating circumcision point out the 10% incidence
      of the uncircumcised population, who develop phimosis,
      trauma, paraphimosis, and recurrent balanoposthitis, come to
      circumcision at a later date requiring anesthetics and
      anxiety to the patient. The difficulties in diabetics with an
      intact foreskin are well known and are another "indication"
      for neonatal circumcision. The incidence of these
      complications, however, in Scandinavia is less than 1% in a
      culture that manages the uncircumcised penis more
      appropriately.</p>

      <p>The new data on urinary tract infections in baby boys has
      caused the American Academy of Pediatric Task Force on
      Circumcision to revise its statement in 1984 from one of "no
      medical indications" to the 1989 statement, "newborn
      circumcision has potential medical benefits and advantages as
      well as disadvantages and risks."<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> Ginsberg and McCracken, in
      1982,<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> were the first to point
      out that 95% of boys with urinary tract infections were
      uncircumcised, data similar to that found in Scandinavia.
      Wiswell and associates, in 1985,<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> in a large military survey found an
      overall incidence of 0.43% urinary tract infections in
      infants; 1.12% were uncircumcised males while 0.11% were
      circumcised males and the females comprised 0.57%. These data
      have been used recently by the "circumcisers" to support
      neonatal circumcision, while neonatologists and pediatricians
      are now more aware of this likely diagnosis.</p>

      <p>We are, nevertheless, impacted by the activities of lay
      groups such as <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/"
      target="_blank">NOCIRC</a> and INTACT as well as the feminist
      movement. These groups have defended the right of the mother
      to refute the American trend toward neonatal circumcision
      even though this carries with it enormous guilt and the
      difficulty of informed consent. When advocates for intactness
      discuss the sexual benefits, they rhapsodically describe the
      dynamic transformability of the intact penis as one of the
      most unique and striking features of sexuality. The mobility
      of the skin and the forefold retraction with erection is the
      preservation of this sensitivity. They describe the
      sensitivity and pleasure of the erogenous penis as being
      chronically altered by the dastardly deed of circumcision.
      There are well over a million men estimated in America that
      would pay good money to have their foreskins restored were
      there an effective procedure.</p>

      <p>The need exists today for a good book for parents
      regarding the facts of infant circumcision. In addition, a
      major effort should be made in instructing the health care
      providers, from mid-wives and nurses to pediatricians and
      urologists, on how to manage the uncircumcised penis.
      Unfortunately the need for cleanliness has been pervasive and
      the forceful retraction of the infant's foreskin is still a
      ritual taught by some of the most respected pediatricians.
      This is absolutely contraindicated and leads to the
      complications of phimosis, balanoposthitis, and other
      problems that will require circumcision.</p>

      <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has a pamphlet
      available entitled, "<a
      href="http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin-care/Pages/Care-for-an-Uncircumcised-Penis.aspx"
       target="_blank">How to Care for the Un-circumcised
      Penis</a>." It can be obtained by sending a self-addressed
      envelope with your request to AAP, Dept. C, 141 Northwest
      Point Blvd., Elk Grove Village, IL 60007. The pamphlet
      describes the natural adhesion of the inner preputial skin to
      the glans and emphasizes avoiding the forceful retraction
      before the natural separation process occurs to the inner
      preputial layer adherent to the glans. Parents should be
      instructed to cleanse the external skin and not to permit
      others to retract the child's fore skin. It is at puberty
      that cleansing beneath the foreskin becomes a routine part of
      the healthy life-style. Natural retraction may not occur for
      many years. It is likely that a significant part of the
      population will choose to remain uncircumcised. We urologists
      should make them comfortable with this choice instead of
      laying a guilt trip. On the other hand, the positive cultural
      connotation of neonatal circumcision in our country is so
      well ingrained that those families wishing to maintain this
      position should be encouraged to make this choice
      forthrightly. The neonate should, however, be afforded the
      benefit of local anesthesia or a penile block and an
      experienced circumciser. Hopefully a balanced informed
      consent will make the parents' decision easier, whichever
      side is chosen.</p>
