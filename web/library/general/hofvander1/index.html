      <h1>CIRCUMCISION IN BOYS:<br />
      TIME FOR DOCTORS TO<br />
      RECONSIDER</h1>

      <hr color="black" size="2" />

      <p class="text"><i>The <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">Convention on the
      Rights of the Child</a> from 1989 states in Article 19 that
      States "shall take all appropriate legislative,
      administrative, social and educational measures to protect
      the child from all forms of physical or mental violation,
      injury or abuse..." Article 24.3 urges all States "to take
      all effective and appropriate measures with a view to
      abolishing traditional practices prejudical to the health of
      children". Article 37 states that "no child shall be
      subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading
      treatment...".</i><br />
       <i>In the UNICEF Implementation Handbook for the Convention
      (1998) it is stated in relation to Article 24.3 that a review
      is to be undertaken regarding "all forms of genital
      mutilation and circumcision". Other traditional practices
      which are to be reviewed include "binding, scarring, burning,
      branding, forced holding under water&hellip;" and similar
      cruel treatment of children. No doubt it is time to
      act!</i><br />
      <i>Apparently no such action has been taken and the
      Convention is not applied in any country as regards
      circumcision of boys - let alone regarding mutilation of
      girls ( which is done by the hundreds of thousands every
      year).</i></p>

      <p class="text"><span class="c">C</span>ircumcision in boys
      is often- in analogy with that in girls -referred to as male
      genital mutilation. MGM, as it deals with the removal of part
      of an organ which has a highly specialized function. This
      term will be used here along with circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumcision
      of boys is performed on a large scale basically in the
      following four categories. The figures are very approximate ,
      based on fertility rates in the respective population groups
      (UNICEF: State of the world's children, 2002) and assuming a
      circumcision rate of 80% (except for the USA where the
      figures can be given reasonably exact).</p>

      <p class="text">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the
      literature on neonatal circumcision in the Anglo-Saxon
      countries is indeed abundant it is remarkable how little is
      known and reported from the other target groups on this
      operation which must be the most frequently reported in the
      world.</p>

      <p class="text"><span
      class="arial"><b>Background</b></span><br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumcision may
      be dated back some 5000 years when it seems to have been
      practiced in Egypt. Cave paintings indicate that it was done
      in adults and according to historical sources <span
      class="numbers">(<a href="#n1">1</a>)</span> the operation
      was not done universally but was limited to high officials.
      The custom slowly spread from there around the Mediterrean
      sea.</p>

      <p class="text">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to
      Genesis 1:17 in the Old Testament (some 3000 years back)
      Abraham got a relevation from God with the content that the
      two should enter into a Covenant. The provision was that
      Abraham should circumcise himself ( 99 years as he was ) and
      all his male house. As a result he should get plenty of
      offsprings and become the ruler of large countries. Also his
      wife Sarah, 90 years, and so far barren should become
      pregnant and give birth to a child (which became Isaak, who
      is considered to be the distant origin of the prophet Mohamed
      who lived more than 2000 years later). Ever since,
      circumcision has been one of the cornerstones in the Jewish
      tradition, although the custom in recent years has become
      more of an ethnic marker and is much less rigidly upheld than
      it used to be <span class="numbers">(<a
      href="#n2">2</a>)</span>.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      Moslem circumcision dates back to the time of Mohamed at the
      7<sup>th</sup> century. It is not mentioned in the Quran and
      is thereby not a Moslem dictum. However, in the explanations
      and comments to be Quran dating back the 7-8<sup>th</sup>
      century, statements are made from which it may be possible to
      conclude that a true Moslem should be circumcised. However,
      as with the Jewish circumcision, it has become more of an
      ethnic marker than a religious must.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      origin and purpose of the MGM in the traditional African
      context is lost in a historical mist. In the traditional
      society the operation is performed prior to puberty as an
      initation rite -the boy has now entered into adult life. In a
      more urban life style the operation may be performed earlier.
      Again, it is a deeply rooted tradition which seems to have
      become also something of an "ethnic" marker.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      neonatal Angl-saxon circumcision was introduced some 150
      years ago as a prophylaxis and treatment for masturbation.
      Little by little nearly hundred other conditions and ailments
      were added, ranging from epilepsy to asthmas to rheumatism-
      indeed a strange range and variety <span class="numbers">(<a
      href="#n3">3</a>)</span>.</p>

      <p class="text"><span class="arial"><b>The
      foreskin</b></span><br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the 7th
      fetal week the male and the female genitals are identical.
      Thereafter the male hormones initiate the development of the
      male genitals.In the 12th week the prepuce is formed as a
      double pleat of skin which grows down to cover the glans. The
      inner layer of the prepuce and glans remain loosely attached
      until about 4 - 5 years and can only be separated by an
      instrument (which is done at circumcision).</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      inner layer of the prepuce and the glans remain loosely
      attached until about 4 - 5 years and can only be separated by
      an instrument (which is done at circumcision).</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      inner layer of the prepuce has a ridged band which contains
      large numbers of nerve endings mediating low threshold and
      fine touch sensations. This ridged band area starts at the
      frenulum (the frenulum band) and will be turned inside out
      when penis is erect, thus forming a highly sensitive
      structure during intercourse. In the same area there is an
      extensive plexus of venules and capillaries. Also a layer of
      smooth muscles bundles are oriented toward the tip of the
      prepuce forming a kind of sphincter which tends to close the
      orifice when penis is flaccid, preventing urine, sand etc
      from gaining access to the preputial space.</p>

      <p class="text">Thus the prepuce is a highly delicate organ
      with very specialized functions and is not "just a piece of
      skin" <span class="numbers">(<a href="#n4">4</a>)</span>.</p>

      <p class="text"><span class="arial"><b>The question of
      medical benefits</b></span><br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible
      to find out why circumcision was first introduced, whether it
      had to do with clearliness or with fertility or it was simply
      a ritual phenomenon intended to give a "marker".</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      medical literature dealing with Moslem and the traditional
      African circumcision is indeed scanty, except for occasional
      articles which are focusing on complications e.g. from South
      Africa.</p>

      <p class="text">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however,
      an abundant literature particularly from the USA on pros and
      cons regarding the neonatal circumcision. An article in the
      Lancet in 1932 <span class="numbers">(<a
      href="#n5">5</a>)</span> claimed that circumcision should
      prevent cancer of the penis in adult age. Later an
      overwhelming number of studies have shown that this is not
      the case. <span class="numbers">(<a href="#n6">6</a>)</span>,
      nor that cancer of the cervix in the partner should be less
      common. Other factors such as early sexual debut, many
      partners, papilloma virus and smoking seem to be
      decisive.</p>

      <p class="text">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a
      higher rate of urinary tract infection during the first few
      weeks in those who are intact but the difference is small. A
      Canadian study has concluded that it would need 195
      circumcisions to prevent one admission to hospital for
      urinary tract infection <span class="numbers">(<a
      href="#n7">7</a>)</span>.</p>

      <p class="text">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately a number of
      studies have claimed that the risk for contracting HIV should
      be lower in those who were circumcised. <span
      class="numbers">(<a href="#n1">8</a>)</span> However,
      conclusive evidence is still lacking, the studies have been
      made in African settings where it may be difficult to rule
      out confounding factors related to environment and
      lifestyle.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
      number of pediatric, surgical and obstetric professional
      societies in the US, in Canada, England and Australia all
      have made statements similar to that of the American Academy
      of Pediatrics (AAP) namely that "these data (scientific data
      demonstrating potential medical benefits) are not sufficient
      to recommend routine neonatal circumcision" <span
      class="numbers">(<a href="#n6">6</a>)</span>.</p>

      <p><span class="arial"><b>Complications</b></span><br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumcision is
      considered to be a minor operation particularly when
      performed in the neonatal period and with due surgical
      precautions. Nevertheless the total complication rate has
      been found in different complications to range between 2-10%
      <span class="numbers">(<a href="#n9">9</a>)</span>. Mainly,
      it concerns bleedings and postoperative infections. But a
      review is made through 184 scientific articles (Circumcision
      and resource pages, CIRP, Internet home page.) lists in
      addition: septicemia, urinary retention, ulceration of the
      meatus leading to stenosis, urethra fistulas, necrosis and
      gangrena of the glans, amputation, and psychological
      sequele.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      complication rates following the circumcisions made in the
      traditional societies by village barbers and similar is
      probably considerably higher and more severe.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      addition complications from anesthesia when used may occur.
      Thus several deaths and near deaths have occurred in Sweden
      in recent years as a result of incompetent handling and
      overdosage of anesthesia and pain relievers <span
      class="numbers">(<a href="#n10">10</a>)</span>.</p>

      <p class="text">The long term complications are only little
      known. Few people are prepared to discuss their genital
      problems publically. Removal of too much of the prepuce up
      including part of the penile shaft skin has been reported
      repeated to cause erectile difficulties, pains and severe
      sexual relation problems. <span class="numbers">(<a
      href="#n10">11</a>)</span>.</p>

      <p class="text">A different long term problem relates to the
      fact that the circumcised penis is a (religious) marker which
      the victim may not necessarily appreciate. He may not wish as
      an adult to associate to the faith of his parents.</p>

      <p class="text">A number of mutilated cases have been brought
      to court recently mainly in the US where the doctor has been
      sued and sentenced to pay fines of up to 1.5 million dollars
      <span class="numbers">(<a href="#n12">12</a>)</span>.</p>

      <p class="text"><span
      class="arial"><b>Trends</b></span><br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was mentioned
      in the beginning a review of "all forms of mutilation and
      circumcision" is about to be made as part of the
      implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
      This is still to come about. The topic is sensitive as it
      concerns areas of tradition and religion which by many are
      considered "untouchable". However, it concerns the well
      -being of the child.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      child has no voice and no say!</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      Sweden recently there have been a number of court cases where
      the (Moslem) father has had the circumcision done on the son
      without the knowledge of or consent from the (non-Moslem)
      mother. Such cases are bound to become more common in times
      when there are more mixed marriages. However, in countries
      like Israel and in many Moslem countries this kind of
      "dilution" will take very long time. In Sweden, however, with
      some 20.000 persons who are stated by Jewish society to be
      included as Jews, only approximately 40 % of their boys are
      being circumcised, the remaining supposedly considering the
      operation dangerous, unnecessary ( as a religious marker) or
      of no importance <span class="numbers">(<a
      href="#n10">10</a>)</span>.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      the Anglo-Saxon countries there is a definite downward trend.
      In the US there was a peak of some 90 % circumcision in the
      1960s. It has now fallen to about 57 % In England it is less
      than 5 % , partly because the operation is no longer paid by
      the NHS. The same trends are seen in Canada, New Zealand, and
      Australia <span class="numbers">(<a
      href="#n13">13</a>)</span>.</p>

      <p class="text"><span class="arial"><b>A new
      law</b></span><br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sweden a law
      has been passed by the Parliament (in 2001) intended to
      regulate circumcisions (about 3000) a year, nearly all
      Moslem, only about 40 Jewish boys). The first 2 months a
      Jewish mohel may perform the operation but with a doctor (or
      nurse) present to give the anesthesia which is now
      obligatory. The Board of Health has issued detailed
      instructions on what and how. After 2 months there has to be
      a doctor to do the operation after informed consent.
      Inspections made recently by the Board indicates that the
      mohels are not abiding by the Boards instructions on
      anesthesia and that boys up to 4 months are being
      circumcised, which is against the law <span
      class="numbers">(<a href="#n10">10</a>)</span>.</p>

      <p class="text"><span
      class="arial"><b>Conclusions</b></span><br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female genital
      mutilation continues by the hundreds of thousands in many
      African countries (and among migrants to the US and the
      Europe!) in spite of strong reactions from the UN and the
      international community, not least from Women's organizations
      that is not compatible with the Child Convention.</p>

      <p class="text">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Male genital
      mutilation which is performed on 100 times more victims has
      attracted much less attention and interest although this
      operation should also be listed as incompatible with the
      Child Convention. It is time for this medically unnecessary
      operation to be brought out into the light and
      scrutinized.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
      as doctors have a clear responsibility to take a lead to
      start combating this medieval and brutal rite some of which
      may have had a religious origin but which is now much more to
      give an ethnic marker and a social happening. If anything it
      should be postponed to the late teens when the child may
      decide for himself. Or be transformed to a non-surgical
      symbolic rite.</p>

      <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
      should be pointed out also that the tradition continues much
      due to strong economic incentives. It gives a good pay to be
      a circumciser either you be a doctor in the US or a barber in
      Africa! In the US some 400 dollars for a few minutes
      work!</p>

      <p class="text">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes you feel
      ashamed of belonging to the profession!</p>
