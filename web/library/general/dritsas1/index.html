      <h1><i>Below the Belt: Doctors, Debate, and<br />
       the Ongoing American Discussion<br />
       of Routine Neonatal Male Circumcision</i></h1>
      <br />

      <p class="2"><b>Lawrence S. Dritsas,<br />
       <i>Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
      University</i></b></p>
      <br />

      <p><i>There has been considerable controversy surrounding the
      routine circumcision of male infants in the United States.
      This is of particular concern, since the medical
      establishments of all the other countries of the developed
      world have abandoned this procedure as having dubious
      benefits. This article examines the medical pros and cons of
      neonatal male circumcision in a historical perspective and
      suggests that the circumstances that led to its establishment
      as a routine practice are largely absent today. Reasons for
      its continued use and ethical and moral issues associated
      with its practice are then examined closely, especially in
      light of the current debate surrounding female circumcision.
      The article concludes that the medical and ethical issues
      surrounding this practice should be more broadly debated
      until there is some consensus as to its benefits. Prudence
      dictates that until such a consensus emerges, the practice
      should be suspended.</i></p>

      <p><span class="init">T</span>his article will discuss the
      routine circumcision of male newborns, infants, and children
      in the hospitals of the United States. Currently, somewhere
      between 60% and 70% of males born in the United States are
      circumcised, typically during the first few days after
      birth.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Because its medical
      benefits are uncertain and the procedure is not without risks
      (although they are low), this practice is exceptionally
      controversial. Also controversial is the fact that the
      routine, nonritual circumcision of baby boys is a uniquely
      American practice. In Gentile America, male circumcision is
      not a recognized mark of group membership or rite of passage
      as it is for many cultures on every continent. The American
      practice, when not necessitated by cultural traditions,
      manifests as an indicated medical procedure that is
      beneficial for the patient. It must be so, surgeons should
      not remove healthy organs from minors without cause; doing so
      challenges a guiding principle in Western medicine: primum
      non nocere (first, do no harm).</p>

      <p>I do not intend to lead an assault against the American
      medical establishment. There is no reason to believe that a
      conspiracy against the American foreskin exists. Nor do I
      wish to analyze the religious and cultural practices of
      circumcision; they have far different histories and issues
      surrounding their continuance. My intention is to "map out"
      the controversy surrounding Gentile American circumcision,
      listen to what each side is saying, and determine what may
      compel them to have the opinions they do. To achieve this
      goal, I have reviewed the medical literature of the past 10
      years, and further when needed. However, this article will
      not present an intensive literature review of every
      scientific study performed during the past 10 years
      concerning circumcision, although most are present here.
      Excellent reviews have been published by the American Academy
      of Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision (<a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">1999</a>) and the
      Canadian Pediatric Society Fetus and Newborn Committee (<a
      href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm"
      target="_blank">1996</a>). To develop their policies, the
      major pediatric organizations undertake exhaustive literature
      reviews and attempt to discern whether a consensus exists
      within the scientific community. Their policies are largely
      informed by these studies.</p>

      <p>The framework for this article will be the policy
      statements given by the American Academy of Pediatrics Task
      Force on Circumcision. The first was released in Pediatrics,
      the journal of the organization, in August 1989. The second
      was released in March 1999. After describing the circumcision
      procedure and its history in the United States, I will
      compare the two policy statements. How did we arrive at the
      1989 statement? What changes in medical knowledge warranted a
      new statement to be released in 1999? To help answer these
      two questions and develop a context in which to consider
      them, I have followed circumcision over the past 10 years in
      a number of journals, including <i>Pediatrics</i>, the <i>New
      England Journal of Medicine</i>, the <i>Journal of the
      American Medical Association</i>, <i>Lancet</i>, and
      <i>American Family Physician</i>.<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> Articles from other journals and
      outside this time period will also be used, and I have
      consulted historical works that deal with the practice.</p>

      <p>Through this analysis, a small number of researchers will
      be prominent, and I feel they may be considered leaders in
      the debate because of the frequency with which they are
      published in the major journals. The opinions of these
      researchers are extremely important, and they are often cited
      in secondary and mass media publications. Landmark studies
      published by these researchers have had a significant effect
      on the opinions of the wider medical community. The
      interpretation and reinterpretation of their results are the
      fuel for many disagreements published in these journals'
      correspondence sections.</p>

      <p>This debate has not remained within the medical community.
      Numerous anti- and pro-circumcision groups have formed around
      the world. Their rhetoric is largely based on published
      medical studies and more "common sensibilities" concerning
      the foreskin and individual rights. Not surprising in modern
      times, these groups have established their presence on the
      Internet. These groups are the sources for numerous anecdotal
      accounts of circumcision procedures and opinions. They must
      be approached cautiously, since it is difficult to determine
      what type of constituency they represent; however, reviewing
      their publications, both electronic and paper based, can be
      informative for any discussion of this controversy.</p>

      <p>Finally, I will attempt to discuss some of the ethical and
      moral issues relevant to the routine circumcision of male
      neonates. Medical necessity versus cultural tradition is a
      common theme here. It is also necessary to consider issues of
      informed consent. Because infants are unable to provide
      consent themselves, the medical community looks to parents or
      guardians for consent by proxy. However, if the medical
      indication for the procedure is controversial and uncertain,
      on what basis are parents to make their decisions? Moreover,
      issues surrounding male circumcision have been complicated in
      recent years owing to the international outcry against female
      circumcision. Are the two procedures comparable? Does
      legislation against female circumcision present a legal
      hypocrisy? Opinions on these issues are extremely
      impassioned.</p>

      <p>Before beginning, I wish to offer a final note concerning
      my analysis. All too often, the boundaries drawn around a
      debate are created by the analysis itself.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> Extremely complex issues become two
      sided under the investigator's scrutiny. In this study, I
      have attempted to avoid this outcome as much as possible, but
      there is little in the literature to suggest otherwise. The
      finality of the procedure presents us with an either/ or
      choice.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> Medical practitioners
      are either for or against the procedure insofar as they
      perform it or they do not. Ambiguity may be found among the
      views of parents, since they were often not consulted in the
      past or do not have sufficient knowledge to make an informed
      decision. However, the status of their sons is not
      ambiguous---they are circumcised or they are not. What is
      interesting about the American situation is the continuing
      widespread practice of male circumcision despite the
      uncertainty of the medical community. It would appear that
      our prudence directs us to continue the practice until
      contraindicated; simply not being conclusively indicated does
      not provide a reason to end this practice. Other societies,
      guided by the British, Canadian, and Australian medical
      communities, have followed the opposite course: They do not
      routinely circumcise their baby boys given the uncertainty
      surrounding its necessity.</p>

      <h3 class="heading">Male Circumcision:<br />
       Explanation of the Procedure</h3>

      <p>The circumcision of males involves the partial or total
      removal of the foreskin, or prepuce, of the penis. The
      foreskin is a complex organ that covers the glans in the
      flaccid state.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> The outer layer
      of the foreskin resembles normal skin, whereas the inner
      layer is a mucous membrane&mdash;the entire structure could
      be considered analogous to the eyelid.</p>

      <p>It should be noted that the foreskin is not an "extra flap
      of skin" as has often been considered but, rather, an
      "important platform for many nerves and nerve endings"
      (Taylor et al., 1996). Foreskin length varies with the
      individual. The circumcision procedure removes the foreskin
      and exposes the glans. After a few weeks, the glans surface
      changes from a moist surface similar to the inside of the
      eyelid or cheek to a more normal skin-like surface. When the
      penis becomes erect, the foreskin "unrolls" to reveal the
      glans. The inner layer of the foreskin is exposed. Taylor et
      al. (1996) and most anti-circumcision groups insist that this
      inner layer is highly sensitive, erogenous tissue and that
      its removal diminishes the patient's quality of life (i.e.,
      enjoyment of sex). Pro-circumcision lobbies tend to ignore
      this question, and few studies have empirically considered
      this question.</p>

      <p>Circumcision is performed by a variety of means. The
      techniques range from simply pulling the foreskin forward and
      cutting the excess with a knife to more technical techniques
      employing specialized clamps.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup>
      Two basic steps must be taken during a circumcision:
      separation of the foreskin from the glans and amputation of
      the foreskin. At all times, care is taken to prevent injury
      to the glans, to not remove too much tissue, and to prevent
      excessive blood loss (American Academy of Pediatrics Task
      Force on Circumcision, 1999).</p>

      <p>The specialists who perform circumcisions are most often
      pediatricians, obstetricians, and family practitioners. When
      circumcision is performed beyond the neonatal period,
      urologists are typically consulted as well (Holman, 1999).
      Physicians are trained in the procedure during their
      residency. A recent survey of residency programs found that
      43% of pediatric residency programs taught circumcision
      compared to 95% of family practice programs and 84% of
      obstetric programs nationwide (Howard et al., 1998).</p>

      <h3 class="heading">A Short History of<br />
       Male Circumcision in the United States</h3>

      <p>As noted by historian David Gollaher (2000), routine male
      neonatal circumcision was almost unknown within the Gentile
      European community (including European settler states) prior
      to 1870. This all changed on February 10, 1870, when Dr.
      Lewis A. Sayre, a noted Manhattan orthopedic surgeon,
      circumcised a 5-year-old boy who was unable to walk. Sayre
      had noticed upon examination of the boy that his foreskin was
      severely constricted around the glans and was inflamed.
      Influenced by contemporary theories of reflex neuroses, where
      irritations at one location in the body could have
      far-reaching effects, Sayre guessed that the constricted
      foreskin was connected to the partial paralysis of the boy's
      legs and decided to circumcise. The boy was cured, and Sayre
      became a powerful proponent of circumcision, publicly
      presenting his findings.</p>

      <p>The burgeoning American medical community was ready to
      accept male circumcision as a solution to many problems. The
      concept of reflex neuroses was popular, and irritation of the
      glans was sure to cause problems elsewhere. It should be
      noted, as Gollaher (2000) pointed out, that female genitalia
      were not safe from the surgeon's knife either. Clitoridectomy
      for treatment of hysteria was not unknown. Maines (1989)
      stated that "late-nineteenth physicians noted with alarm that
      from half to three-quarters of all women showed signs of
      hysterical affliction." I believe, given the evidence of
      these two historians, that we can infer a general hysteria
      among the medical community concerning the genitalia of its
      patients (male and female) during this time period, and many
      types of solutions including electric shock, therapeutic
      massage, and surgery were being proposed to cure those
      patients. It is also important to remember that these
      treatments all cost money, and that the social class and
      power of the individuals purchasing such treatments will be
      important for their growing acceptance in American society. A
      nagging historical problem in this area is why female
      treatments for various problems died out whereas male
      circumcision became an almost universal practice among
      American males, and their doctors. Gollaher mentions a
      growing acceptance of Freudian sexuality and the limited
      number of women who were actually being operated on as
      possible reasons.</p>

      <p>Sayre was not alone in his crusade, but he was a pioneer
      in medical circumcision. An important step in the spread of
      the practice was the 1891 publication of <i>A History of
      Circumcision From the Earliest Times to the Present</i> by
      Peter Remondino, a Californian physician and public health
      official. An excerpt from chapter 23, "Reflex Neuroses and
      the Prepuce," illustrates the hysteria surrounding the
      foreskin and Sayre's preeminence in the field. Although it is
      lengthy, I feel this excerpt is an important indicator of
      late-19th-century passions and worth including here. The
      excerpt is responding to the argument that practicing careful
      genital hygiene is as effective as circumcision in preventing
      pathologies of the penis, an argument we find in journals
      today:</p>

      <blockquote>
        The prepuce seems to exert a malign influence in the most
        distant and apparently unconnected manner; where, like some
        of the evil genii or sprites in the Arabian tales, it can
        reach from afar the object of its malignity, striking him
        down unawares in the most unaccountable manner; making him
        victim to all manner of ills, sufferings, and tribulations;
        unfitting him for marriage or the cares of business; making
        him miserable and an object of continual scolding and
        punishment in childhood, through its worriments and
        nocturnal enuresis; later on beginning to affect him with
        all kinds of physical distortions and ailments, nocturnal
        pollutions, and other conditions calculated to weaken him
        physically, mentally, and morally; to land him, perchance,
        in the jail, or even in a lunatic asylum. Man's whole life
        is subject to the capricious dispensations and whims of
        this Job's-comforts-dispensing enemy of man. In this
        regard, Louis A. Sayre was to medicine what Columbus was to
        geography. Neither Strabo nor Herodotus had anything to say
        regarding what existed beyond the pillars of Hercules, and
        neither Hippocrates nor Galen had anything in regard to
        this preputial Merlin, which in their day, even, had its
        existence. Neither Tissot nor Bienville, the two pioneers
        in the field of our knowledge regarding onanism and
        nymphomania, dream of the existence of this one cause of
        the diseases to which they gave so much time and study. It
        is only some twenty years since Louis A. Sayre read his
        paper entitled "Partial Paralysis from Reflex Irritation
        Caused by Congenital Phimosis and Adherent Prepuce," before
        the American Medical Association. This was the
        starting-point from whence the profession entered into what
        had previously been a veritable "Darkest Africa." (pp.
        254-256)
      </blockquote>

      <p class="2">Nothing short of circumcision will solve the
      problems outlined by Remondino. Sayre began a new movement in
      American medicine that was picked up by the public health
      community of which Remondino was a part. Remondino prescribed
      circumcision as a method to avoid some of the evils of life,
      not simply a cure for illnesses. The shift from curative to
      preventive medicine was under way, and doctors began to
      consider circumcision as a prophylactic procedure, necessary
      for a "clean" life.</p>

      <p>From the public health perspective, circumcision promoted
      a cleaner, more hygienic state that would limit the spread of
      contagion through society. If the foreskin was absent, there
      would be no place for smegma to build up. Gollaher (2000)
      connected this sentiment to the urban sanitation movements of
      the 1880s. Dirt was a corrupt source of contagion, and many
      of the body's secretions, especially smegma, were considered
      dirty. It was also pointed out by Remondino (1891) and others
      of the time that Jews were healthier than other groups, and
      the reason was that Jewish males are ritually circumcised 8
      days after birth. Another benefit mentioned by Remondino was
      the cessation of masturbation, a true evil in Victorian
      society. From an article by Kistler titled "Rapid Bloodless
      Circumcision of Male and Female and Its Technic" in the May
      28, 1910, issue of the <i>Journal of the American Medical
      Association</i>, the reasons for circumcisions are listed as
      follows:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Reduced tendency to convulsions in infancy arising from
        irritable nervous system.</li>

        <li>Habit of masturbation not so likely to be formed.</li>

        <li>Lessened irritability of child or adult.</li>

        <li>Amorosity reduced.</li>

        <li>A hygienic condition promoted.</li>

        <li>Venereal diseases not so readily contracted, and
        consequently:</li>

        <li>Fewer pelvic diseases in women.</li>

        <li>For impotency in old men, as has been advocated.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Kistler (1910) also acknowledged that learning proper
      techniques of circumcision is critical for all physicians,
      since "many a surgeon has lost his best clients, and likewise
      many a good prospect has gone glimmering because of the
      unfortunate outcome of this little operation." Doctors had a
      stake in this procedure, wished to promote its use, and
      realized that a public that did not traditionally practice
      circumcision would be skeptical at first. Thus, the spread of
      this procedure is connected not only with curing sickness and
      promoting public health but also with the power and influence
      that doctors have over their patients. Convincing men and
      parents to allow surgery when no pathology existed was no
      small task. The foreskin became an inherently pathologic
      appendage of the human body; the circumcised penis was the
      new physiologic norm. Anyone who was smart and listened to
      their doctor would accept this. Likewise, all parents should
      have their boys circumcised, since that is what doctors were
      doing for their own children, as physicians were quick to
      point out.</p>

      <p>Gollaher (2000, p. 97) also connected the rise of
      circumcision with the general increase in operations. He
      pointed out that there were 200 hospitals in the United
      States in 1870 and more than 4,000 by 1910. These hospitals
      needed business. Moreover, new aseptic techniques developed
      by Lister made all surgical procedures safer.</p>

      <p>As more and more of the middle class began using doctors
      and their new facilities, circumcision became connected with
      childbirth. Doctors saw that older healthy male patients were
      unwilling to go under the knife in large numbers; however,
      infants were a different matter altogether. As Gollaher
      (2000) stated, "The ultimate popularity of circumcision
      depended not on convincing normal men to undergo the ordeal
      of sur-gery but on targeting a group of patients who could
      not object" (p. 100). Thus, the medicalization of childbirth
      included the circumcision of infants. Laumann et al. (1997)
      correlated the increasing incidence of circumcision with the
      increase in hospital births. Circumcision became a mark of
      the hospital and modernity, and by this mark the individual
      himself was modern.</p>

      <p>The practice of routine male neonatal circumcision
      gathered momentum in the United States and spread to the
      other English-speaking countries of the world. In all cases,
      a common theme is present and has been pointed out by
      anti-circumcision groups: The practice was introduced to
      English-speaking, Gentile communities by the medical
      profession itself. The medical community then proceeded to
      make circumcision a standard procedure by passing the
      techniques along in the medical schools. The reasons for the
      procedure were not as important as its proper performance.
      Consider the following analysis of medical training styles in
      pediatric residency programs from 1998:</p>

      <blockquote>
        In most undergraduate and postgraduate training programs,
        one finds an implicit apprenticeship learning model (my
        mentor must be right), in which students observe what the
        teachers do and then emulate these clinical strategies with
        little scrutiny paid to the true value of the strategies.

      <p class="2">Therefore, any change in opinions toward
      circumcision would have to be a self-reflective process for
      the medical community. When the medical community discusses
      circumcision today, a discussion of why it began the practice
      in the first place is noted by its ab-sence. Furthermore, any
      move to abolish a practice becomes in effect a condemnation
      of physicians who are performing it and the doctors who
      passed the technique on.</p>

      <p>By the mid 1960s, close to 90% of males born in United
      States were being circumcised at birth, an increase from 35%
      in 1932 and from almost nil in 1870 when Sayre performed his
      first operation.<sup><a href="#n7">7</a></sup> Between 60%
      and 70% of males continue to be circumcised today. The
      radical procedure begun by Sayre had become a routine medical
      procedure.</p>

      <h3 class="heading">1989 Report of the American Academy<br />
       of Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision</h3>

      <p>The final paragraph of the 1989 report of the American
      Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision states,</p>

      <blockquote>
        Newborn circumcision has potential medical benefits and
        advantages as well as disadvantages and risks. When
        circumcision is being considered, the benefits and risks
        should be explained to the parents and informed consent
        obtained.
      </blockquote>

      <p class="2">The task force is, in effect, pushing the
      responsibility of deciding to circumcise to the parents. It
      is necessary to pursue more history in order to understand
      the context in which this report was produced and why the
      task force is surprisingly unwilling to make any sort of
      normative statement.</p>

      <p>Remondino's book demonstrates that in 1891, some
      dissenting voices were arguing against medically indicated
      circumcision. Remondino wrote the book to quell that dissent.
      In the next century, Gollaher (2000) stated that "over the
      decades, as squabbles about ritual circumcision faded away,
      the ethical issue of doing surgery on healthy patients was
      virtually ignored. Voices urging restraint were few and
      faint" (p. 95). The silence ended with Gairdner's 1949
      publication of "<a href="/library/general/gairdner/">The Fate
      of the Foreskin: A Study of Circumcision</a>" in the
      <i>British Medical Journal</i>.In cash-strapped World War II
      Britain, a fledgling National Health Service was keen to work
      out the costs and benefits of all the procedures it would
      provide. Gairdner began his article,</p>

      <blockquote>
        It is a curious fact that one of the operations most
        commonly performed in this country is also accorded the
        least critical consideration. In order to decide whether a
        child's foreskin should be ablated the normal anatomy and
        function of the structure at different ages should be
        understood; the danger of conserving the foreskin must then
        be weighed against the hazards of the operation, the
        mortality and after-effects of which must be known. Though
        tens of thousands of infants are circumcised each year in
        this country, nowhere are these essential data assembled.
        The intention of this paper is to marshal the facts
        required by those concerned with deciding the fate of the
        child's foreskin.
      </blockquote>

      <p class="2">Gairdner's article was a voice of prudence
      challenging a medical practice that was performed for what he
      considered dubious and unsubstantiated reasons. Probably the
      most important aspect of his article concerned phimosis, a
      condition in which the inner layer of the foreskin is
      pathologically adhering to the glans. Gairdner noted that at
      birth, the foreskin is attached to the glans and begins to
      separate over time. By 5 years old, most boys are able to
      retract their foreskins; some may take longer for full
      separation. In other words, diagnosis of phimosis before the
      age of 5 is an error, since the condition is completely
      physiologic. Despite this fact, circumcision of toddlers and
      newborns is still often prescribed in the United States owing
      to phimosis or its prevention. Furthermore, the forcible
      retraction of the foreskin for inspection of the glans of
      toddlers was causing iatrogenic conditions, since the
      practice of tearing apart tissues prematurely was damaging.
      In conclusion, Gairdner advised,</p>

      <blockquote>
        In the light of these facts a conservative attitude towards
        the prepuce is proposed, and a routine for its hygiene is
        suggested. If adopted this would eliminate the vast
        majority of the tens of thousands of circumcision
        operations performed annually in this country, along with
        their yearly toll of some 16 child deaths.
      </blockquote>

      <p>After the publication of this article, the British
      National Health Service decided not to provide coverage for
      routine circumcision. As a national body with power to
      enforce policy, the British National Health Service was able
      to consider the evidence and make a decision that directly
      affected clinical practice nationwide. At this point, the
      incidence of circumcision in the United Kingdom declined and
      was listed as 0.5% in 1972 (Wallerstein, 1980). The procedure
      became once again a solely religious practice in the United
      Kingdom. However, in the United States, where no central
      medical body existed to make such decisions, the practice
      continued unchallenged and was promoted by the American
      military for its soldiers as protection against venereal
      disease, a belief dating from the late 19th century
      (Gollaher, 2000, p. 118). In the United States circumcision
      became more common, while in the United Kingdom it
      disappeared. It was not until the 1960s that the American
      medical journals began to publish articles critiquing routine
      neonatal circumcision. In 1965, Dr. William Morgan published
      "<a href="/library/general/morgan/">Rape of the Phallus</a>"
      in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>.
      Morgan asked, "Why is the operation of circumcision
      practiced? One might as well attempt to explain the rites of
      voodoo! Ritual is seldom self-explanatory and still less
      frequently logical" (p. 123). In this somewhat
      tongue-in-cheek article, Morgan conjured up images of foreign
      women protecting their baby boys from American hospital staff
      possessing "an insatiable urge" to remove the foreskin.
      Although full of conjecture, the article employed commonsense
      thinking: The logic used to justify routine circumcision
      should also justify routine appendectomies, and many mothers
      who are used to their circumcised husbands will view an
      uncircumcised penis as less aesthetic. Morgan also oddly
      proposed the following: "[Circumcision] is the one way an
      intensely matriarchal society can permanently influence the
      physical characteristics of its males." In the end, Morgan
      concluded that there is no valid indication for circumcision
      other than religion. If nothing else, Morgan's article caused
      a stir.</p>

      <p>In the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>, Bolande
      (1969) compared circumcision and tonsillectomy as two
      "ritualistic surgeries, widely performed on a nonscientific
      basis" (p. 591). Bolande did not go so far as to call for a
      stop to the practice (and some correspondence to the article
      criticized him for this). However, he did point out that
      circumcision is a uniquely American practice and that the
      reasons given for the procedure are unsubstantiated. The
      following year, Preston (1970) published a widely cited
      article titled "<a href="/library/general/preston/">Whither
      the Foreskin? A Consideration of Routine Neonatal
      Circumcision</a>" that called the practice into question:</p>

      <blockquote>
        It is interesting to note that all of the reasons advanced
        for routine circumcision have to do with the prevention of
        certain conditions, not with the establishment of a
        condition such as strong teeth and bones or a normal
        cardiac reserve. (p. 1853)
      </blockquote>

      <p class="2">Preston then analyzed the evidence for the
      reasons given to indicate routine circumcision: cancer of the
      cervix in women with unaltered partners, cancer of the penis,
      phimosis, venereal disease, balanitis, masturbation, and
      social acceptance in the locker room. In each case, the
      evidence was controversial, the actual risks of penile
      illness involved were miniscule (as in penile cancer), or, as
      in the case of phimosis, a misinterpretation of penile
      physiology existed. Preston concluded the article with the
      statement, "Circumcision of the newborn is a procedure that
      should no longer be considered routine."</p>

      <p>U.S. national medical organizations were not unaware of
      these articles and past events in the United Kingdom. In
      1971, after reviewing the available evidence, the American
      Academy of Pediatrics Committee on the Fetus and Newborn
      stated that "there are no valid medical indications for
      circumcision in the neonatal period" (p. 110). With this
      pronouncement, the public debate over circumcision had begun.
      The position of the American Academy of Pediatrics was
      repeated in <a href="/library/statements/aap/#1975">1975</a>
      and again in 1983, and no reasons had come forward to change
      its opinion. However, unlike the British National Health
      Service, the policy statements of American medical societies
      are in effect only suggestions.</p>

      <p>It was also during this time period, in 1980, that Edward
      Wallerstein published <i>Circumcision: An American Health
      Fallacy</i>. Wallerstein attempted to present the
      contradictions in the medical literature concerning the
      reasons for circumcision. He concluded the book by
      classifying circumcision in the United States as "a solution
      in search of a problem" (p. 197).</p>

      <p>The incidence of male circumcision was only somewhat
      affected by the new policies and publications. In the period
      between 1974 and 1984, the incidence of routine circumcision
      dropped from 86% to 71% but was still the highest compared to
      other countries in which circumcision was not ritually
      performed (Wiswell, 1990). In an effort to find the reason
      for this high incidence, two studies in 1982 and 1983
      examined the effects of the provision of information to
      pregnant mothers. In each study, the incidence of
      circumcision was more than 90%. Whether or not the mothers
      had received information about circumcision made no
      statistical difference in their decisions. The 1983 study
      stated that</p>

      <blockquote>
        we are reluctant to assume the role of active advocacy (one
        way or the other) because our experience suggests that the
        decision is not usually a medical one. Rather, it is based
        on the parent's perceptions of hygiene, their lack of
        understanding of the surgical risks, or their desire to
        conform to the pattern established by the infant's father
        and their own societal structure. (Maisels et al., 1983, p.
        453)
      </blockquote>

      <p>This study, whether the authors intended to or not,
      represents an enormous shift both in the rhetoric deployed to
      support circumcision and in the relationship between doctors
      and parents considering the procedure. Were the authors
      implying that routine male neonatal circumcision is an
      irrational American cultural practice? If so, it goes against
      everything that Sayre, Remondino, and their peers were
      arguing for in the late 19th century. They were promoting
      circumcision as a rational, scientifically indicated medical
      procedure that reasonable, educated parents would choose for
      their sons.</p>

      <p>In both studies of the parents' choices, the ethical
      propriety of performing a procedure that is not medically
      indicated is never discussed, although the policy of the
      American Academy of Pediatrics at that time was that such
      procedures should not be performed. In the case of
      circumcision, parental wishes have become sufficient while
      medical necessity, normally a guiding rule for the surgeon's
      knife, takes a back seat.</p>

      <p>Apparently, despite the publicly stated policy of the
      American Academy of Pediatrics (as well as the American
      College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American Academy
      of Family Physicians) that circumcision was not indicated,
      pediatricians continue to perform the surgery. There are two
      options that will help us explain this paradox: first, that
      the pediatricians are acting on the parents' wishes despite
      the new policies, and second, that the pediatricians simply
      do not agree with the new policies and rely on the proven
      experiences of their own clinical practices. The first option
      is almost ridiculous, since the idea of doctors performing
      surgeries on minors that they do not agree with nor feel are
      indicated is an impossibility and could constitute
      malpractice. But as outlandish as this option may seem,
      Maisels et al. (1983) considered it a strong possibility
      because parents are apparently not considering medical
      necessity when opting to circumcise their boys. If this is
      so, the physicians do not seem to realize these reasons, or
      never asked. Therefore, the second option appears more
      plausible: most American pediatricians still felt that
      circumcision was a sound decision that bestowed upon the
      individual a superior physiological state and that parents
      agreed. This was the received wisdom of the trade.</p>

      <p>Everything changed again in 1985 when Dr. Thomas Wiswell
      published his report titled "Decreased Incidence of Urinary
      Tract Infections in Circumcised Male Infants." Here was the
      problem that circumcision needed. The study found that
      urinary tract infections (UTIs) were 10 times as common in
      uncircumcised boys. Subsequently, studies were published from
      other institutions that corroborated this finding. A
      particularly heated exchange in the Letters to the Editor of
      the January 1990 issue of <i>Pediatrics</i> that responded to
      Wiswell and Geschke's June 1989 article titled "Risks From
      Circumcision During the First Month of Life Compared With
      Those for Uncircumcised Boys" is demonstrative of the debate
      concerning the procedure. Wiswell and Geschke concluded that
      "neonatal circumcision [is] beneficial in reducing the
      incidence of urinary tract infection and associated
      bacteremia" and that "short-term complications of routine
      circumcision are rare and mostly minor" (p. 1011). Those
      responding called the findings into question. The major
      complaints were that (a) a case record analysis of urinary
      tract infections may have missed many infants who were
      treated as outpatients and not admitted, (b) the study was
      not a "cohort-based" study with control groups, (c) the
      reasons that circumcision was not performed could have
      predisposed the baby boy to UTI (e.g., premature birth), and
      (d) most of these studies had a number of confounding
      variables present that were not accounted for. A short
      article published in <i>Lancet</i> also questioned the
      connection between UTI and circumcision by suggesting that
      modern medical intervention in the entire birth process
      exposes the infant to nonmaternal bacteria strains. With
      regard to increased UTI incidence, the authors postulated
      that</p>

      <blockquote>
        if [the UTI studies] are correct, this will be the first
        known instance of a common potentially lethal disease being
        preventable by extirpation of a piece of normal tissue. To
        reconcile this phenomena with existing views of evolution
        and biology, it is suggested that the affects of one
        unphysiological intervention are counterbalancing those of
        another---ie, colonization of the baby's gastrointestinal
        tract and genitals in maternity units by Escherichia coli
        strains of non-maternal origin, to which the baby has no
        passive immunity. (Winberg et al., 1989)
      </blockquote>

      <p>Whatever the complaints raised against the studies
      connecting urinary tract infections to unaltered boys, the
      American Academy of Pediatrics still felt compelled to
      reevaluate its policy. The review panel produced the August
      1989 report cited at the beginning of this section. In policy
      language, the fact that the American Academy of Pediatrics
      admitted that neonatal circumcision had "potential benefits
      and advantages" was a dramatic change from its previous
      statements beginning in 1971. In the increasingly litigious
      society of the late 1980s and early 1990s, not performing
      procedures that could possibly benefit the patient had
      definite consequences that could result in malpractice suits.
      Some possible benefits given for circumcision were prevention
      of penile cancers and decreased UTI rates among newborn boys.
      The new policy also gave pro-circumcision advocates fuel for
      their rhetoric. Conversely, performing a surgery without
      medical cause is also malpractice; thus, the American Academy
      of Pediatrics' policy freed doctors to choose either path
      with support.</p>

      <p>The policy shift resulted in a new wave of controversy in
      the <i>American Family Physician</i>, <i>Pediatrics</i>, and
      the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. In March 1990,
      Wiswell published "Routine Neonatal Circumcision: A
      Reappraisal" in the <i>American Family Physician</i>. Wiswell
      was gladdened by the shift toward not opposing the practice.
      The article was presented along with two editorials by <a
      href="/library/disease/UTI/altschul1990/">Martin Altschul</a>
      and Robert Dozer that spoke against routine circumcision.
      Later that year, in December, four letters to the editor and
      Wiswell's reply appeared. All of the articles and letters are
      impassioned pleas for their case. Wiswell viewed UTI in
      newborn males as a dangerous disease that is almost
      completely preventable by a quick surgical intervention.
      Altschul admitted to the increased rates of UTI in unaltered
      males but saw the overall incidence of UTI as so low that, by
      his math, $60,000 worth of routine circumcisions are
      performed to prevent each case of UTI. Dozer insisted that
      circumcision is a secularized religious practice.</p>

      <p>In the response letters, both sides of the argument are
      present. David Lay (1990, p. 1522), a family physician,
      indicated that he supports routine neonatal circumcision
      because unlike pediatricians, he sees the complications among
      uncircumcised adult male patients that pediatricians do not.
      In effect, he accused anti-circumcision pediatricians of not
      being able to "think outside the box" and consider the
      problems of adulthood. Another strong letter in support of
      Wiswell was written by Edgar J. Schoen, chairman of the 1989
      American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision.
      Schoen influenced the task force to view routine circumcision
      in a more positive light. In fact, the 1989 policy was not
      strong enough for Schoen, since it did not fully recommend
      the procedure. Schoen's views were expressed more completely
      in an article he published in the May 3, 1990, issue of the
      <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. His article was
      placed alongside <a href="/library/general/poland/">that of
      Ronald L. Poland</a>, a physician at The Pennsylvania State
      University College of Medicine who is against routine
      circumcision as a medically indicated practice.</p>

      <p>Schoen (1990) matched the logic and use of evidence
      employed by Wiswell. Their reasons for supporting neonatal
      circumcision are characterized by the following excerpt from
      Wiswell (1990): Several issues have convinced me of the
      benefits of neonatal circumcision:</p>

      <blockquote>
        (1) the prevention of urinary tract infections and their
        sequelae; (2) the prevention of penile cancer; (3) the
        prevention of sexually transmitted diseases; (4) the low
        risks of complications from the procedure; (5) the lower
        incidence of penile problems among circumcised boys; (6)
        the recent evidence that circumcision protects against HIV
        infection; (7) the cost-benefit from performing the
        procedure during the neonatal period rather than in
        childhood or adulthood; and (8) the lack of evidence for
        the hypothesis that "optimal" penile hygiene prevents the
        adverse sequelae of noncircumcision. (p. 859)
      </blockquote>

      <p class="2">Interestingly enough, there are some points of
      agreement between this list and the list from 1910 presented
      earlier. However, Schoen's article adds cancer of the cervix
      to the list, and there is more agreement between the
      pro-circumcision arguments of 1910 and those of 1990. If
      fact, both sides of the circumcision debate have themes that
      have not changed since the 1880s, such as the notion that
      proper penile hygiene provides the same benefit to the
      individual that circumcision does. Despite more than a
      century of medical practice, the debate surrounding male
      circumcision remains fundamentally the same, supported and
      opposed by the same arguments: circumcision promotes health
      versus circumcision is not necessary for health and detracts
      from quality of life. This alone would suggest that the key
      issues in the debate are not related to medical science but
      to social perceptions of medical practices. The decision to
      circumcise is not based on experiments and statistics---the
      decision is based on assumed traditions and the relationship
      between physicians and parents, a relationship that appears
      to be suffering from a severe breakdown in communication.</p>

      <p>I have also found that the fourth reason as presented by
      Wiswell (1990) is a bit illogical. Surgical procedures are
      not done because they have a low risk of complication; this
      is not, as Wiswell states, "a benefit of circumcision." This
      argument strategy runs throughout the pro-circumcision
      arguments, typically stated thus: "The benefits of routine
      circumcision of newborns as a preventative health measure far
      exceed the risks of the procedure" (Schoen, 1990). A proper
      comparison would be of the long-term effects of circumcision
      versus the effects of remaining unaltered. Unfortunately, we
      find few studies, if any, that follow this design. The
      studied effects of circumcision are the absence of uncommon
      diseases. Other long-term effects of the procedure are
      rarely, if ever, studied. I found no major work that searches
      for such effects, only anecdotal remarks.</p>

      <p>Further analysis of the responses to the 1989 policy
      concerns the anti-circumcision authors, Poland and Dozor.
      Each author concluded that parents make the decision to
      circumcise their sons for nonmedical reasons. Dozor called it
      a secularized religious practice. This argument betrays a
      misunderstanding of history. There is no evidence to suggest
      any connection between Jewish and Moslem religious practices
      and routine medical circumcision in the United States. On the
      contrary, Sayre and his contemporaries believed solely in the
      medical efficacy of the procedure. The American medical
      community fought an uphill battle to build widespread
      acceptance for routine circumcision among its patients. The
      medical community believed in the procedure and its benefits.
      Therefore, Poland, who argued that the question is not
      completely medical, and Dozor, who argued that the medical
      community promotes a crypto-religious practice, are both
      wrong.</p>

      <p>If parents in the 1990s are not questioning the medical
      community about circumcision, it is because they have learned
      to trust the authority of the physician. Their parents
      trusted that authority, and many of their grandparents did as
      well. This is how the circumcision rate went from relatively
      nonexistent to nearly 90% in one century. The continuing
      decision to circumcise made by modern parents does not then
      indicate that male circumcision has somehow left medicine and
      entered the cultural sphere; on the contrary, it indicates
      the general acceptance of medical authority and routine. The
      fact that so many doctors have "wrung their hands" of the
      debate and left the issue up to the parents represents the
      acceptance by those physicians of a different role in
      society, one that is subservient to culture. However, if a
      baby boy is taken away to be circumcised with little or no
      discussion between physician and parent, then the parents
      have accepted the physician's authority. They have, in the
      least, accepted some past physician's authority, for the
      father will typically be circumcised, and this is a common
      reason provided for choosing to circumcise. The physician has
      not accepted the parents' culture. Consider the following
      excerpt from a 1990 study of the reason parents choose to
      circumcise:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Families of healthy infants should receive adequate
        education regarding circumcision and support for their
        decisions. We question the wisdom of actively discouraging
        parents who seem in favor of circumcision or even those who
        seem ambivalent. On the other hand, maintaining neutrality
        while presenting medically unsophisticated parents with
        circumcision data that continues to confuse physicians also
        seems unhelpful. (Larson &amp; Williams, 1990, p. 808)
      </blockquote>

      <p class="2">Here, doctors are portrayed less as medical
      advisers and more as sources of unfiltered, controversial
      medical information that wait for "unsophisticated" parents
      to give them orders. If the doctors have accepted a new role,
      the patients are not aware of it.</p>

      <p>I will now leave the 1989 policy statement and take a look
      at the new policy, written in 1999. The issues raised here
      will continue to be relevant as we reach the present.</p>

      <h3 class="heading">1999: A Return to the 1970s?</h3>

      <p>Beginning with the articles mentioned above, a storm
      erupted around circumcision in the 1990s. Lay
      anti-circumcision groups such as the <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/">National Organization of
      Circumcision Information Resource Centers</a>, the <a
      href="http://www.noharmm.org/">National Organization to Halt
      the Abuse and Routine Mutilation of Males</a>, and <a
      href="http://www.washington.edu/gcd/DOC/">Doctors Opposing
      Circumcision</a> gained power and presence, especially on the
      Internet. The "noise" made by these groups, the international
      recognition of female circumcision, the continuing
      publication of conflicting studies throughout the 1990s, and
      the pronouncements against routine circumcision made by
      foreign organizations of pediatricians in Canada, the United
      Kingdom, and Australia sent the American Academy of
      Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision back to the drawing
      board. This time, the task force extensively researched the
      English-language medical literature back to 1960 to review
      what was known and reported that</p>

      <blockquote>
        existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical
        benefits of newborn male circumcision; however, these data
        are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal
        circumcision. In the case of circumcision, in which there
        are potential benefits and risks, yet the procedure is not
        essential to the child's current well-being, parents should
        determine what is in the best interest of the child. To
        make an informed choice, parents of all male infants should
        be given accurate and unbiased information and be provided
        the opportunity to discuss this decision. It is legitimate
        for parents to take into account cultural, religious, and
        ethnic traditions, in addition to the medical factors, when
        making this decision. Analgesia is safe and effective in
        reducing the procedural pain associated with circumcision;
        therefore, if a decision for circumcision is made,
        procedural analgesia should be provided. If circumcision is
        performed in the newborn period, it should only be done on
        infants who are stable and healthy. (1999, p. 686)
      </blockquote>

      <p class="2">Both sides of the debate were looking for a bit
      more than this. It should be noted as well that the Council
      of Scientific Affairs of the American Medical Association
      reviewed the literature concerning routine male circumcision
      and produced similar findings.</p>

      <p>To its benefit, the task force did point out what few had
      previously: Circumcision does greatly reduce the incidence of
      UTI and penile cancer, but the absolute incidence of both
      these diseases is so rare that circumcising routinely to
      prevent so few cases cannot be recommended. Schoen and
      Wiswell were furious and joined forces with Stephen Moses to
      publish a polemic in <i>Pediatrics</i> in March 2000. One can
      see how emotional both sides can become in this argument:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Further, by referring to circumcision as "not essential to
        the child's current well-being," the Task Force seems to be
        arguing against other preventative health measures, such as
        routine immunization, preventive dental care, and nutrition
        aimed at future health, none of which are essential to the
        current well-being.
      </blockquote>

      <p class="2">Schoen et al. also criticized the task force of
      interdisciplinary imbalance, being mostly pediatricians and
      not able to view the procedure from a lifelong view. They
      felt that circumcision was a necessity for lifelong health
      and was best performed during the newborn period. They felt
      that circumcision should be routine. Schoen has repeatedly
      compared circumcision to a vaccine.</p>

      <p>These criticisms of the overall rationale of the policy
      are harsh and not completely unfounded. Some individuals may
      feel that a 1:100,000 risk of penile cancer and a 1% chance
      of UTI in the first year of life is enough of a risk to
      choose circumcision. But the recurring problem with risk
      assessment and circumcision is that individuals are not
      making these decisions for themselves; rather, parents are
      making proxy decisions for their sons. No one can know how
      these boys would have evaluated the data.</p>

      <p>The 1999 policy statement is far more comprehensive than
      the 1989 statement. Many are pleased to see that the task
      force recommends procedural analgesia. This removes some of
      the paradoxical stance toward the circumcision procedure
      versus other surgeries, in which analgesia is always used.
      The task force also broached the subject of the sexual
      experience and circumcision status. A few recent studies,
      both anatomical and social, show that the foreskin is much
      more than simply a flap of skin. The future quality of life
      for an individual is a consideration in the circumcision
      decision. Some men, given the chance, may have opted to
      remain unaltered, deciding that the dynamics of sexual
      experience outweigh the low risk of disease.</p>

      <h3 class="heading">Informed Consent and Neonatal
      Surgery</h3>

      <p>The new policy is not without problems, however, and these
      are generally contradictions between statements concerning
      male circumcision and more general ethical statements made
      elsewhere by the American Academy of Pediatrics. By allowing
      the parents take the responsibility for the circumcision
      decision, the academy has challenged other policies
      concerning informed consent. The practice of obtaining
      consent by proxy for the treatment of infants and children is
      well accepted in the American community. However, the
      American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics noted
      in 1995 that</p>

      <blockquote>
        providers have legal and ethical duties to their child
        patients to render competent medical care based on what the
        patient needs, not what someone else expresses. Although
        impasses regarding the interests of minors and the
        expressed wishes of their parents are rare, the
        pediatrician's responsibilities to his or her patient exist
        independent of parental desires or proxy consent.
      </blockquote>

      <p class="2">It would appear that the American Academy of
      Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics is acknowledging the rights
      of the parents to raise their children, but within bounds.
      Medical experts have some power to provide appropriate
      treatment against the parents' wishes when necessary. This
      reasoning also extends to the refusal to perform certain
      procedures that parents ask for. It must be asked upon what
      criteria are physicians making their choices versus the
      parents? The policy on circumcision clearly states that we
      need to respect cultural and traditional values. But, as I
      have argued, medical circumcision in the United States is not
      a cultural decision, it is a medical decision; therefore,
      medical considerations should come first. If that is the
      case, then it follows that the Committee on Bioethics' policy
      outweighs the parents' wishes. Critically, I should note here
      that the American Academy of Pediatrics has never asked its
      Committee on Bioethics to consider male circumcision
      (Gollaher, 2000, p. 200).</p>

      <p>We are now at the stage in the argument when comparison to
      other societies will prove beneficial. I would also like to
      bring the topic of female circumcision into the discussion.
      Here, I hope to show that while the United States is the
      least critical of male circumcision, it has joined other
      societies in taking a strong stance against female
      circumcision.</p>

      <h3 class="heading">Circumcision on the International
      Scene</h3>

      <p>As previously stated, Canada, the United Kingdom, and
      Australia all imported the practice of routine male
      circumcision from the United States. However, the incidence
      of the procedure never reached the levels it did here. Since
      World War II, the practice has almost ceased in the United
      Kingdom, Australia has about 10% of its males circumcised,
      and Canada has between 3% and 6%. Various pediatric
      associations in these three nations have spoken sharply
      against the practice. The Canadian Pediatric Society Fetus
      and New Born Committee (<a
      href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm">1996</a>)
      followed the American Academy of Pediatrics' position
      closely, indicating that circumcision could <span
      class="not">[not]</span> be recommended but that parents may
      opt for the procedure for cultural reasons. This position has
      not changed since 1982. The Australian College of
      Pediatricians decided that it could not be dogmatic about the
      procedure but noted that in the majority of cases, medical
      reasons will not be a primary motivating factor in parents'
      decisions. The college did admit that there may be a legal
      issue involved, in that the procedure may violate human
      rights, but the courts have not made a determination.</p>

      <p>In stark contrast to this rather conservative position,
      the Australasian Association of Paediatric Surgeons (<a
      href="/library/statements/aaps/">1996</a>) is absolutely
      opposed to routine male circumcision, calling it
      "inappropriate and unnecessary." Likewise, neither the U.K.
      General Medical Council nor the British Medical Association
      supports routine circumcision. Each also makes a point to
      physicians that they may refuse to perform the procedure if
      requested. It should be noted that in the United Kingdom,
      almost all circumcisions performed are done for religious or
      medically indicated reasons and that the rate of newborn male
      circumcision is less than 1%.</p>

      <p>In the English-speaking world, there is some consensus
      concerning male circumcision, even if establishing reasons
      for its continuing popularity in the United States is a
      challenge. Possibly because the practice began here or
      because we have no official national health service to
      dictate policy, the routine circumcision of males as a
      "system" gained momentum over time. The procedure came to be
      compared with cutting the umbilical cord, a normal step in a
      boy's birth. As physicians were trained in the practice, they
      went on to train their apprentices. Also, most male
      physicians are circumcised themselves, thus reinforcing the
      feeling that circumcision is a normal, routine practice and
      that a circumcised penis is itself "normal." Not being
      circumcised was abnormal and uncommon, nearly but not quite
      pathologic. These traditions internal to the medical
      community are some possible reasons for Gentile American
      circumcision.</p>

      <h3 class="heading">Female Versus Male Circumcision:<br />
       What Is the Difference?</h3>

      <p>Initially, I feel compelled to qualify the following
      section. "Female circumcision" represents a spectrum of
      practices from ritually pricking the labia to shed a drop of
      blood, to full infibulation, an appalling mutilation of a
      woman's genitalia. Therefore, it is difficult to group these
      practices under one name, although Western media, opinion,
      and policy have not typically differentiated between
      them.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> In this section, I will
      deliberately avoid discussing these practices in particular
      while trying to emphasize the inherent problems involved in
      using different language to discuss male and female
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>Just last year, in 1999, with the new policy of the
      American Academy of Pediatrics, all the major pediatric
      associations in the English-speaking countries came to
      agreement that they could at least no longer strongly
      recommend routine male circumcision (Gollaher, 2000),
      although most allow the practice for cultural reasons and in
      no case is it completely illegal. However, in the opening
      paragraph of the British Medical Association's (1996) "<a
      href="/library/statements/bma/">Guidance for Doctors</a>"
      concerning male circumcision is the following sentence: "The
      subject should not be confused with female `circumcision'
      which was outlawed by the 1985 Prohibition of Female
      Circumcision Act."</p>

      <p>To most observers in the United States, female
      circumcision is a whole different story when compared to male
      circumcision. This is made clear by Schoen (1995):</p>

      <blockquote>
        The problem with describing female genital mutilations as
        female circumcision is that the latter can be confused with
        the circumcision of newborn boys, a low-risk procedure with
        medical benefits.
      </blockquote>

      <p class="2">Therefore, excision of healthy flesh from a
      healthy child is acceptable if scientific studies say it is
      so, not if the choice is made for cultural reasons and the
      patient is female. This statement, however, is contradicted
      by Schoen's many other statements in which he claims that the
      final choice for male circumcision is the parents', and often
      for nonmedical reasons, which would seem to describe the
      practice of female circumcision as well.</p>

      <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics
      (1998) made the following determination in 1998 concerning
      female circumcision:</p>

      <blockquote>
        The American Academy of Pediatrics: 

        <ol>
          <li>Opposes all forms of female genital mutilation
          (FGM)</li>

          <li>Recommends that its members actively seek to dissuade
          families from carrying out FGM</li>

          <li>Recommends that its members provide patients and
          their parents with compassionate education about the
          physical harms and psychological risks of FGM</li>

          <li>Recommends that its members decline to per-form any
          medically unnecessary procedure that alters the genitalia
          of female infants, girls, and adolescents.</li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="2">Compare the fourth recommendation with the
      following excerpt from the 1999 American Academy of
      Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision, part of which I repeat
      for emphasis:</p>

      <blockquote>
        In the case of circumcision, in which there are potential
        benefits and risks, yet the procedure is not essential to
        the child's current well-being, parents should determine
        what is in the best interest of the child. (p. 686)
      </blockquote>

      <p class="2">The Committee on Bioethics is quite clear on its
      ban of medically unnecessary procedures for female minors,
      but not so for males, who are absent from the discussion
      completely. Also, it is quite clear that a woman who has
      reached 18 years of age may do as she pleases, since she is
      able to legally consent. Males do not have the same luxury or
      the chance to decide for themselves, according to the Task
      Force on Circumcision. Possibly more important, the Committee
      on Bioethics provides physicians with the ability to refuse
      parents' wishes concerning their daughters; conversely, the
      Task Force on Circumcision states, "Parents should not be
      coerced by medical professionals."</p>

      <p>Is this really a case of apples and oranges? Or are we
      applying a double standard to practices of altering the
      genitalia? The foreskin is erogenous tissue, and its loss at
      birth has unknown effects on a man's future sexual
      experience. Fortunately for most American men, they will
      never know the difference. This fact alone has probably
      affected the entrance of the loss of sexual sensitivity into
      the discourse surrounding male circumcision. There are no
      studies available that are conclusive, and any study done
      would be extremely subjective.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup>
      We will not find volunteers to undertake before-and-after
      studies. Thus, this question, while often brought up by the
      anti-circumcision groups, is unfortunately difficult to
      answer. Given that we may never know the answer, some other
      forms of evidence may be useful. One hundred years ago, the
      foreskin was removed to halt masturbation, and nymphomania in
      males could be cured by circumcision.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> That the foreskin was connected to
      sex was common knowledge in late Victorian society. This fact
      may help us consider circumcision today.</p>

      <p>There is also the question of age. In America, most men do
      not remember their circumcision day, but adolescent women
      from Africa do. The effect of firsthand testimonials by
      supermodels on television of being held down in a foreign
      village to be cut in unsanitary conditions is horrific. But
      why then do we not consider the image of a helpless infant
      being taken from parents who freely offer him, strapped down
      to a table, and circumcised without anesthesia equally
      horrific? Yet, this procedure was standard for nearly a
      century in the United States. Clearly, the cultural situation
      surrounding circumcision is the important determinant of its
      impropriety, and it is always easier to condemn the
      foreign.</p>

      <p>Reports of female and male circumcision in Arabia were
      first popularized in the West by Sir Richard Burton in <i>A
      Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Medinah &amp;
      Meccah</i> (1854). Burton was notorious for supposedly having
      himself circumcised as a necessary part of his conversion to
      Islam (Rice, 1990). These reports were received with
      indignation; such activities were only dimly known to
      European Christian and were always the practices of
      semibarbarous foreigners or European Jews, who were outside
      of mainstream society. However, the reports of Western
      doctors circumcising boys in New York City in the 1870s were
      only mildly opposed. This was a product of European culture
      and science.</p>

      <h3 class="heading">Conclusion</h3>

      <p>The questions ending the last section are why this project
      was done. To reiterate an initial point: I am not attacking
      the American medical profession. Sayre and his peers were
      offering solutions for a society they saw fraught with
      problems and being invaded by immigrants. The need for
      sanitation was great. Circumcision was a means to an end.</p>

      <p>This problem of contemporary circumcision ultimately
      reduces to a question of evidence. When the medical
      profession of the late 19th century introduced circumcision
      to the public as a new procedure, what constituted supporting
      evidence was far different from what we need today. There
      were no population-based longitudinal studies performed to
      prove that circumcision was the cure for a host of ailments.
      Circumcision appeared to be a cure because Sayre made a boy
      walk again and because the Jews of North America appeared to
      be a healthier minority, and all Jewish men are circumcised.
      Given the same criteria today, we would never introduce
      routine circumcision.</p>

      <p>Currently, the medical world is a far different arena than
      it was 130 years ago. Sayre deduced that circumcision would
      work as a panacea; today, the same cure must be proven by
      inductive logic. However, we do circumcise the majority of
      our boys while large national-level medical organizations all
      over the world continue to review the medical literature and
      find that, according to today's standards, there is no reason
      for male circumcision. The paradox is clarified by
      recognizing that the evidence does not show that the
      procedure is particularly harmful either. The medical
      community cannot inductively show that it should cease
      circumcising male neonates. This is the position we are in
      today. One would think that in light of such confusion, the
      procedure would be brought to a halt until we knew for
      certain according to contemporary standards of evidence how
      circumcision affects us. This is not occurring. Why?</p>

      <p>The answer to this question, I believe, lies in the aura
      of professional credibility. As stated above, most doctors
      are taught according to an apprentice model. The profession
      has a tradition that it follows. For a physician to cease
      performing circumcisions is far more than a change of
      clinical practice in light of new evidence. All the reviews
      of literature performed by medical organizations in many
      countries, including our own, concerning routine male
      circumcision show that there was never sufficient cause,
      according to contemporary standards, to routinely amputate
      the foreskins of baby boys. For a physician to cease
      performing circumcisions now represents a condemnation of
      past practices and an admittance of error. The error is most
      serious because it is committed upon the genitalia. The
      decline in tonsillectomies in recent decades is a famous
      example of changes in medical opinion, but the foreskin is
      somewhat different, more hidden and taboo. Furthermore, the
      tonsils were removed in an overactive response to a
      pathological condition; circumcision is purely preventative
      and a response to possible future pathologies.</p>

      <p>To call into question the received knowledge of the
      medical profession, passed from doctor to resident, is a
      revolution of sorts, for progress typically means new and
      better procedures to replace the old, not the cessation of a
      common practice. I believe this is why we see such tentative
      statements coming from of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
      By purposely avoiding its own Committee on Bioethics, the
      American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision was
      able to equivocate the issue before our eyes. What the task
      force is saying in effect is, "As scientific doctors, we find
      ourselves unable to recommend or deny this procedure;
      therefore, you will decide and we shall be your scalpels.
      This is no longer a medical question." In one dramatic sweep,
      the task force decided not to make a decision and absolved
      itself of all guilt while continuing to perform a
      questionable procedure. There is no other medical procedure
      performed on minors, male or female, that follows this policy
      or has this history. But in the United States in the year
      2001, this is the policy we have for neonatal male
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>Maybe I am unfair in my assessment. It is entirely
      possible that the only way to make sense of the numerous
      unsolved paradoxes above is to concede that circumcision is
      an important rite of passage in Gentile American culture. If
      this is so, it is a silent ritual, uncelebrated and
      unacknowledged by all who participate. I am unaware of any
      symbolism surrounding medical circumcision besides that of
      the sterile room, the masked doctors, and the stainless steel
      instruments. This is the culture of medical science.</p>

    <h3 class="heading">Notes</h3>

    <div class="notes">
      <a id="n1" name="n1"></a> 

      <p>1. Finding clear, uncontested statistics is difficult. The
      National Center for Health Statistics reports 62.8% incidence
      nationwide in 1997. However, regional differences are seen
      (39% in the West compared to 81.6% in the Midwest), and a
      recent survey of residency programs (Howard et al., 1998)
      showed consistently higher rates. Studies done in the early
      1980s reported circumcision rates near 100% at individual
      hospitals (Herrera et al., 1982; Maisels et al., 1983).</p>
      <a id="n2" name="n2"></a> 

      <p>2. Obviously, <i>Lancet</i> is a British journal. However,
      many articles on circumcision can be found, as well as many
      contributors to U.S. journals. It should be noted that the
      incidence of the procedure in the United Kingdom is far less
      than that in the United States.</p>
      <a id="n3" name="n3"></a> 

      <p>3. A fitting term for this discussion, since many consider
      penile pathologies warranting circumcision to be
      iatrogenic.</p>
      <a id="n4" name="n4"></a> 

      <p>4. Some suggest that circumcision may be reversed by a
      variety of techniques and that reversal procedures have been
      performed since antiquity. This practice is not widespread,
      and it is unclear as to whether it constitutes a true
      reversal of neonatal circumcision or a new physiological
      state (see Bigelow, 1992).</p>
      <a id="n5" name="n5"></a> 

      <p>5. Taylor et al. (1996) published a <a
      href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">landmark article</a> that
      presents the first careful study of foreskin anatomy at
      macroscopic and microscopic levels.</p>
      <a id="n6" name="n6"></a> 

      <p>6. Examples are the Mogen clamp, the Gomco clamp, and
      Plastibell devices.</p>
      <a id="n7" name="n7"></a> 

      <p>7. See <a href="/library/general/laumann/">Laumann et al.
      (1997)</a>. It can be assumed that only Jews and Moslems were
      practicing circumcision in 1870, neither of which constituted
      a significant portion of the population at that time.</p>
      <a id="n8" name="n8"></a> 

      <p>8. I am heavily indebted to my colleague, Wairimu Njambi,
      who has recently defended her dissertation on female
      circumcision. Our frequent discussions contributed greatly to
      my understanding of these issues.</p>
      <a id="n9" name="n9"></a> 

      <p>9. I should also add that no modern studies have been
      performed to determine possible benefits of female
      circumcision. This is not an attempt to be insensitive on my
      part but, rather, to point out discrepancies in scientific
      evidence used for policy statements.</p>
      <a id="n10" name="n10"></a> 

      <p>10. Many examples of this can be found in Remondino
      (1891).</p>
