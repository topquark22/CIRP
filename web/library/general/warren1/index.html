      <h2>Circumcision of Children</h2>

      <p>E<font size="2">DITOR</font>&mdash;We are all adult men
      who believe that we have been harmed by circumcision carried
      out in childhood by doctors in Britain. We are concerned
      about the ethics of this surgery on children and that it is
      commonly carried out when it is not essential. We have read
      the BMA's ethical guidelines which give no guidance to
      practitioners who are faced with a boy who has been referred
      for circumcision.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> The possible
      future wishes of the patient should be considered.</p>

      <p class="2">Although it was shown 28 years ago that
      preputial development continues to the age of 17 and that
      only three of 1968 boys needed surgery,<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> many British doctors still seem to be
      ignorant of this research.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> The
      <a href="/library/ethics/alderson/">European charter for
      children in hospital</a> states that every child must be
      protected from unnecessary medical treatment. The <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">United Nations
      Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> states that
      children have rights to self determination, dignity, respect,
      integrity, and non-interference and the right to make
      informed personal decisions. Unnecessary circumcision of boys
      violates these rights.</p>

      <p class="2">A non-retractile foreskin in a boy can be
      managed conservatively.<sup><a href="#n4">4,5</a></sup>
      Circumcision should therefore rarely be necessary. It would
      be helpful if paediatric urologists could produce guidelines
      to advise doctors how foreskin problems can be managed.
      Preferably, circumcisions should not be done until the
      patient is adult or at least old enough to understand what is
      intended; then he has a right to a full, illustrated
      explanation of the nature of the operation and the reasons
      for it in advance, with the opportunity to ask questions, and
      help in coming to terms with the alteration of his anatomy
      afterwards. If the patient is not satisfied with the
      explanations his views should be taken into
      consideration.</p>

      <p class="2">It cannot be ethical for a doctor to amputate
      normal tissue from a normal child. In the case of disease,
      circumcision should be used only when there is evidence that
      conservative treatment is unlikely to be effective or that is
      it has failed. Avoiding surgery may be cheaper for purchasers
      of health care. Doctors should approach the child's foreskin
      with a combination of good ethics, a recognition of the
      rights of children. and advice based on evidence.</p>
