      <h1>Newborn male circumcision:<br />
      Needless and dangerous</h1>
      <b>By Robert Leon Baker, M.D.</b> 

      <p><img src="Fig1.jpg" alt="Dr. Baker" align="right"
      hspace="20" vspace="20" /> Circumcision, the most widely
      performed surgery on males in this country, has the least
      scientific justification of any surgical procedure. Excepting
      its use as a religious rite, circumcision is done basically
      for cosmetic reasons, much like ear piercing in females or
      for the emotional concerns of parents&mdash;reasons that lack
      scientific validity.</p>

      <p>Since parents are the decision-makers for such surgery, I
      queried each mother who had requested such surgery during one
      year when I delivered 254 male infants at the <a
      href="http://lej-www.med.navy.mil/">Naval Hospital</a>, Camp
      Lejeune, N.C. Among their reasons for requesting this surgery
      were religious (although most of the parents were Protestant
      or Catholic, not Jewish), hospitals and doctors demanding it
      to prevent masturbation, to improve love life and that
      "everybody is doing it." No one stated prevention of cervical
      or penile cancer or problems with infection or retraction of
      the foreskin, the supposed main medical reasons for such an
      operation.</p>

      <h4>Covenant with God</h4>

      <p>The Egyptians practiced circumcision about 2,000 years
      ago, first for their princes and later for their slaves.
      Since the beginning of their history the Jews have
      traditionally circumcised their newborn males as a symbol of
      their covenant with God.</p>

      <p>Circumcision became routine in this country during the
      late 1940s and early 1950s, but pediatricians are now
      opposing it. A considerable portion of both the medical and
      lay literature that has accumulated on circumcision can prove
      very little, other than that Jewish women are generally less
      susceptible to cervical cancer, and that in some ethnic
      groups who practice circumcision, there is a lower incidence
      of penile cancer.</p>

      <p>From what we know today about penile cancer, absence of
      the prepuce appears to prevent the disease, particularly of
      the prepuce. But, perhaps the answer lies more in routine
      cleanliness than surgery. One noted authority, Victor
      Marshall, M.D., of Cornell Medical Center, has stated that it
      would require a surgeon to spend his entire professional life
      doing nothing but circumcision to prevent only a single case
      of penile cancer.</p>

      <p>It is true that Jewish women have 80% less cervical cancer
      than non-Jews, but Indian Muslim wives of husbands
      circumcised at puberty do not have less cervical carcinoma
      than Hindu women whose husbands are not circumcised. Also,
      Algerian Jewesses have a greater incidence of such cancer
      than Algerian Muslim and European women. Similar findings,
      indicating the absences of such a protective effect, have
      been made elsewhere.</p>

      <p>The studies showing such a protective effect are flawed by
      their heavy dependence on questioning women about their
      husband's status regarding circumcision. Many women do not
      have an accurate understanding as to what circumcision is.
      This is an important consideration, because there are
      different degrees of circumcision with varying amounts of
      foreskin left after the operation.</p>

      <p>Part of the case presented for circumcision as
      preventative against cervical carcinoma is that smegma is
      supposed to be a carcinogen. But studies in animals with
      human and human and animal smegma have failed to substantiate
      this. In one study, for example, human smegma (and later
      horse smegma) failed to induce skin cancer in susceptible
      strains of mice.</p>

      <p>Risks of circumcision are considerable. The newborn's
      prepuce is normally nonretractable. Complications from forced
      retraction of the foreskin before the space between it and
      the glans develops naturally, can be paraphimosis, infection,
      meatitis, meatal ulcer, and bleeding.</p>

      <p>That circumcision is far from benign is indicated by a
      death rate of infants from one year for this procedure of 16
      per 90,000, an incidence of 1:6000 operations. The death rate
      is considerably lower after one year of age. Death rates in
      this country have to be estimated, however, because
      statistics on circumcision are not kept here.</p>

      <p>There is considerable hemorrhage in 15% of circumcisions,
      and in about 2% of newborns, this can be quite serious. It
      may require transfusion and even be fatal. There is one
      horror story from Cyprus, where Muslims are circumcised
      between the ages of four and 13. One operator there
      circumcised 23 males, of whom 13 got tetanus and five
      died.</p>

      <p>According to Meredith E. Campbell, M.D., tens of thousands
      of needless early neonatal circumcisions are performed in the
      United States&mdash;an operation which should be considered
      only if the prepuce is not retractable at age four.</p>

      <h4>Tell the parents</h4>

      <p>It would appear from statistics that at least 41 children
      are needlessly sacrificed to prevent one case of penile
      cancer. If we assume there to be about 1,325,000 newborn male
      circumcisions in the U.S., the annual cost to the consumers
      is around $54 million. And at least 229 of these newborns
      will die as a result of the operation.</p>

      <p>If circumcise we must, then let's wait one year, thus
      lowering the mortality 50%. Better yet, we should wait until
      there is a definite indication for this procedure, which
      would be past age three. And let us tell parents that it is
      not the thing to do unless there is a specific
      indication.</p>
