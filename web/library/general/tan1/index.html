      <h3>Summary</h3>

      <p class="text2"><i>Routine circumcision is gaining
      popularity in our community, as it is said to be a safe and
      painless operation in the neonate, and offers improved
      hygiene. That the foreskin is cleaner is undisputed, but
      whether the operation is safe is questioned.</i></p>

      <p class="text2"><i>This article reviews the common problems
      encountered, and also reviews the physiology of the foreskin.
      The pros and cons of circumcision is discussed together with
      some complications of circumcision. The view is expressed
      that routine circumcision should not be encouraged.</i></p>

      <p class="text"><i>Keywords: Circumcisions<br />
       Complications</i></p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p class="text2">The foreskin, one of the smallest parts of
      our integument, is still shrouded in much controversy, In
      spite of the fact that circumcision has been practised for
      4000 years, there is still argument surrounding the
      indications for circumcision. Some regard the foreskin as
      functionless piece of skin prone to infection and Phimosis,
      and recommend that it be dispensed with quickly in the
      neonatal period, before it has a chance to give rise to any
      problems.</p>

      <p class="text2">Not many realise that it serves an important
      physiological role and much has been forgotten about the
      function of the foreskin, in our stampede to extirpate it out
      of existence.</p>

      <p class="text2">Mindful of the controversy surrounding this
      issue, this article aims to examine the function of the
      foreskin, if indeed there is any, and some of the common
      problems encountered and the treatment available.
      Circumcision is also discussed, together with some of the
      complications arising from the procedure.</p>

      <h3>The Physiology of the Foreskin</h3>

      <p class="text2">The foreskin is unretractable at
      birth.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> This is due to the glans
      penis and deep surface of the foreskin sharing a common layer
      of squamous epithelium.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> As
      keratinisation of the epithelium occurs, the prepuce becomes
      progressively detached from the glans and becomes
      retractable. This process is completed in 90% of boys by the
      age of five but Oster states that full retractability does
      not occur until early teenage years.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> 3% of 16 year olds surveyed by him
      still had incompletely retractable foreskin, which
      subsequently became retractable at 17.</p>

      <p class="text2">The term Phimosis (muzzled in Greek)
      therefore should not be used to describe a non retractable
      foreskin, as non-retractability is neither uncommon nor
      pathological in the young.</p>

      <p class="text2">Hence, "Phimosis seen in children is
      physiological, and serves to protect the glans from
      ammoniacal dermatitis. That this is so is attested to by the
      prevalence of meatal stenosis following circumcision,
      reported to occur in 8 to 31% of children circumcised.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup> Similarly, meatal stenosis in the
      uncircumcised male, while reported, is an extremely rare
      entity.</p>

      <p class="text2">Some parents express concern because of
      accumulation of thick whitish yellow creamy "pus" under the
      foreskin. This is smegma, a collection of shedding epithelial
      cells. Often smegma will accumulate, forming thick white
      smegma cysts. This gradually separates from the glans penis
      and inner prepuce, and spontaneously discharges. Again this
      is physiological and does not demand any form of treatment at
      all, except for reassurance that this does not consitute an
      infection. The smegma actually helps in separating the two
      layers of epithelium.</p>

      <p class="text2">The foreskin can be liked to a rosebud which
      remains closed and muzzled. Like a rosebud, it will only
      blossum when the time is right. No one opens a rosebud to
      make it blossum. Most children will also grow out of their
      "Phimoses" without any need for manipulation or
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">In spite of this, one is often asked to see
      children because the family doctor or the parents are
      concerned about the foreskin. Some of the commoner problems
      encountered are described, together with their
      management.</p>

      <h3>Phimosis</h3>

      <p class="text2">True Phimosis is caused by a thick white
      fibrous ring around the prepuce, which makes retraction
      impossible (Fig. 1) This condition is caused by Balanitis
      Xerotica Obliterans. In this condition, the skin becomes pale
      gray, thin and parchment like, and the foreskin looses its
      suppleness. There is atrophy and thinning of the epidermis,
      replacement of the underlying dermis with dense collagenous
      tissue infiltrated with chronic inflammatory cells.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> The epidermis separates easily from
      the underlying dermis.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision is indicated for this
      condition.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> An important
      consideration at operation is not to remove the leathery
      plaque from the glans if it is involved (as is often the
      casee) or meatal stenosis will ensue. This condition can also
      be progressive, involving the anterior urethra, and it may be
      necessary to administer topical hydrocortisone to arrest the
      spread.</p>

      <h3>Non Retractable Foreskin</h3>

      <p class="text2">Some children may develop balanitis, and on
      examination are found to have a firmly fused tip without
      evidence of true scarring. This may be regarded as Phimosis
      by many people, but again its due to physiological adhesions.
      If the foreskin is retracted, the "Phimosis" is no longer
      evident, being lax and freely retractable as illustrated
      (Fig. 2, 2a).</p>

      <p class="text2">This can be treated with a high degree of
      success by liberal topical application of 1% hydrocortisone
      cream six times a day for four weeks, with less frequent
      applications for a further two months<sup><a
      href="#n7">7</a></sup> once the foreskin has started to
      become retractable.</p>

      <h3>Redundant Foreskin</h3>

      <p class="text2">The most common reason for a child to have
      redundant foreskin is obesity, where the penis is buried in
      pre-pubic pad of fat. Performing a circumcision for redundant
      foreskin in this situation will only lead to the more severe
      problem of a "buried" or hidden penis, cosmetically more
      devastating for the child and much more difficult to correct.
      Circumcision is contraindicated in the obese child with
      redundant foreskin.</p>

      <p class="text2">Importantly, parents often bring a child
      with redundant foreskin for consultation because they are
      concerned not about the redundancy, but about the apparent
      micropenis. Here it is important to reassure the parents that
      the child is adequately endowed, demonstrating to them the
      length of the penis by retracting the pre pubic pad of fat
      away.</p>

      <h3>Recurrent Balanitis</h3>

      <p class="text2">It is not too uncommon for a growing child
      to develop balanitis during the process of separation of the
      epithelial surfaces normally adherent.<sup><a
      href="#n8">8</a></sup> Circumcision for this or because the
      prepuce is still adherent is a radical measure, though it is
      commonly requested.</p>

      <p class="text2">It would appear illogical to circumcise a
      child for one episode of balanitis, in the same way as it is
      illogical to submit a child to tonsillectomy after one
      documented attack of tonsillitis However, there remains the
      occasional child in whom circumcision is justified because of
      repeated attack of balanitis.</p>

      <h3>Hypospadias</h3>

      <p class="text2">In very minor hypospadias, where the
      predominant problem is a dorsal hooded foreskin, circumcision
      alone will produce a satisfactory cosmetic and functional
      result. However, it must be stressed that any hypospadiac
      penis that is more severe should not be circumcised, as the
      dorsal hooded foreskin is required for corrective
      surgery.</p>

      <h3>Chordee without Hypospadias</h3>

      <p class="text2">Chordee without hypospadias requires
      correction to ensure adequate to ensure adequate sexual
      function. Most of these are isolated skin chordee, but a few
      are due to congenitally short urethras requiring a formal
      urethroplasty. In either case, the child should not be
      circumcised as the skin is needed for correction of the
      chordee.</p>

      <h3>Penoscrotal Web or Webbed Penis</h3>

      <p class="text2">Occasionally, the scrotal skin encroaches on
      the shaft of the penis producing a midline web extending
      often to the tip. This can be easily corrected without
      circumcision with a simple flap procedure.</p>

      <h3>Urinary Tract Infections</h3>

      <p class="text2">Phimosis as a cause of urinary tract
      infections is very rare, although reported. If a child has a
      documented urinary tract infection, then it is mandatory to
      exclude other problems and not attribute it to phimosis.</p>

      <h3>Eczema</h3>

      <p class="text2">This is surprisingly not uncommon and the
      presenting complaint is a persistently itchy foreskin. On
      examination, one sees a scaly rash usually at the tip of
      prepuce. This should be treated not by circumcision but by
      hydrocortisone.</p>

      <h3>Ballooning Foreskin</h3>

      <p class="text2">Ballooning of the foreskin is attributed to
      malalignment of the external urethral meatus and the
      preputial orifice.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> It can also
      arise soley because of the laxity and length of the
      foreskin.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> Unless it is causing
      symptoms, no treatment is necessary. Symptomatic problems can
      be treated by hydrocortisone or by progressive gentle
      retraction.</p>

      <p class="text2">Having discussed the various conditions that
      can afflict the foreskin, there remains a significant
      proportion of parents who remain proponents of circumcision.
      Before recommending this procedure to our patients, it would
      be worthwhile examining the complications that could arise,
      and weigh the risks against advantages gained.</p>

      <h3>Complications of Circumcision</h3>

      <p class="text2">The commonest complication as already
      discussed, is meatal stenosis. An exposed glans particularly
      in a neonate is prone to ammoniacal dermatitis. When this
      affects the meatus, a meatal ulcer ensues and heals with
      subsequent stenosis. (Fig. 3)</p>

      <h3>Haemorrhage</h3>

      <p class="text2">This is a well known complication of
      circumcision, and the incidence of post operative bleeding
      has been quoted at 7%.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

      <h3>Urethral Trauma</h3>

      <p class="text2">Urethral fistula from a misplaced suture has
      been described, and is as difficult to treat as any urethral
      fistulae.</p>

      <h3>Inadequate Circumcision</h3>

      <p class="text2">This is probably the commonest complication
      requiring re-operation in the author's experience. It results
      when either too little or too much skin is removed. If too
      little prepuce is removed, the remaining "hood" can cover the
      glans. With ensuing cicatrisation, this produces an even more
      severe iatrogenic phimosis (Fig. 4) This will inevitably
      require circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Removing excess skin and denuding the shaft
      of penile skin is of particular danger in obese children,
      leaving them with a buried penis.</p>

      <h3>Gangrene</h3>

      <p class="text2">Fortunately, this is a very rare
      complication of neonatal circumcision (Fig. 5). It may be due
      to necrotising fasciitis (Fourniers Gangrene) or occasionally
      from indiscriminate use of electrocoagulation. Although rare,
      one cannot predict when this severe complication may
      arise.</p>

      <h3>Sepsis</h3>

      <p class="text2">The incidence of sever wound infection
      following circumcision has been reported to be of the order
      of 4%.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> One wonders if the
      incidence of low grade infection is not higher than this,
      considering that the fresh incision is bathed in a pool of
      urine and faeces, while it heals.</p>

      <p class="text2">Meningitis and necrotising enterocolitis has
      been seen by this author as a complication of neonatal
      circumcision. In addition, the incidence of neonatal sepsis
      in newborn males in North American, a predominantly
      circumcised population is twice that of females.<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> Is this due to an inherent weakness of
      boys, or could it be that neonatal circumcision provides an
      extra portal of entry for microorganisms?</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Neonatal circumcision
      can no longer be considered a safe and harmless
      operation.</span> The fact that both the American Academy of
      Pediatrics and the Australian College of Paediatrics have
      discouraged this practice attests to the concern shared by
      most paediatricians on the safety of the procedure.</p>

      <p class="text2">There is no doubt that the circumcised penis
      is cleaner and the operation eliminates phimosis.
      Circumcision probably also reduces the incidence of cervical
      carcinoma in female partners as well as reducing the
      incidence of penile carcinoma.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup> However one has to consider if the
      risks outweigh the advantages.</p>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Currently, substantial
      literature evidence points to the fact that circumcision is
      not without significant complications. The foreskin plays an
      important protective role in the young. Let us therefore not
      interfere with it, but give it the respect it
      deserves.</span></p>
