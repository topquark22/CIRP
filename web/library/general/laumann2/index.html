      <h2>Sexual Dysfunction in the United States</h2>

      <h3>Prevalence and Predictors</h3>

      <p><b>Edward O. Laumann, PhD<br />
       Anthony Paik, MA<br />
       Raymond C. Rosen, PhD</b></p>

      <p><b>Context</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;While recent pharmacological
      advances have generated increased public interest and demand
      for clinical services regarding erectile dysfunction,
      epidemiologic data on sexual dysfunction are relatively scant
      for both women and men.</p>

      <p><b>Objective</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;To assess the prevalence and
      risk of experiencing sexual dysfunction across various social
      groups and examine the determinants and health consequences
      of these disorders.</p>

      <p><b>Design</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis of data from the
      National Health and Social Life Survey, a probability sample
      study of sexual behavior in a demographically representative,
      1992 cohort of US adults.</p>

      <p><b>Participants</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A national probability
      sample of 1749 women and 1410 men aged 18 to 59 years at the
      time of the survey.</p>

      <p><b>Main Outcome Measures</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk of
      experiencing sexual dysfunction as well as negative
      concomitant outcomes.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexual dysfunction is more
      prevalent for women (43%) than men (31%) and is associated
      with various demographic characteristics, including age and
      educational attainment. Women of different racial groups
      demonstrate different patterns of sexual dysfunction.
      Differences among men are not as marked but generally
      consistent with women. Experience of sexual dysfunction is
      more likely among women and men with poor physical and
      emotional health. Moreover, sexual dysfunction is highly
      associated with negative experiences in sexual relationships
      and overall well-being.</p>

      <p><b>Conclusions</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The results indicate that
      sexual dysfunction is an important public health concern, and
      emotional problems likely contribute to the experience of
      these problems.</p>

      <hr />

      <p>Sexual dysfunctions are characterized by disturbances in
      sexual desire and in the psychophysiological changes
      associated with the sexual response cycle in men and
      women.[<a id="ref1" name="ref1" href="#n1">1</a>] Despite
      increasing demand for clinical services and the potential
      impact of these disorders on interpersonal relationships and
      quality of life,[<a id="ref2" name="ref2" href="#n2">2</a>,<a
      id="ref3" name="ref3" href="#n3">3</a>] epidemiologic data
      are relatively scant. Based on the few available community
      studies, it appears that sexual dysfunctions are highly
      prevalent in both sexes, ranging from 10% to 52% of men and
      25% to 63% of women.[<a id="ref4" name="ref4"
      href="#n4">4-6</a>] Data from the Massachusetts Male Aging
      Study[<a id="ref7" name="ref7" href="#n7">7</a>] (MMAS)
      showed that 34.8% of men aged 40 to 70 years had moderate to
      complete erectile dysfunction, which was strongly related to
      age, health status, and emotional function. Erectile
      dysfunction has been described as an important public health
      problem by a National Institutes of Health Consensus
      Panel,[<a id="ref8" name="ref8" href="#n8">8</a>] which
      identified an urgent need for population-based data
      concerning the prevalence, determinants, and consequences of
      this disorder. Even less is known about the epidemiology of
      female sexual dysfunction.</p>

      <p>Professional and public interest in sexual dysfunction has
      recently been sparked by developments in several areas.
      First, major advances have occurred in our understanding of
      the neurovascular mechanisms of sexual response in men and
      women.[<a id="ref9" name="ref9" href="#n9">9-11</a>] Several
      new classes of drugs have been identified that offer
      significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of male
      erectile disorder,[<a id="ref12" name="ref12"
      href="#n12">12-14</a>] while other agents have been proposed
      for sexual desire and orgasm disorders.[<a id="ref15"
      name="ref15" href="#n15">15</a>,<a id="ref16" name="ref16"
      href="#n16">16</a>] Availability of these drugs could
      increase dramatically the number of patients seeking
      professional help for these problems. Epidemiologic data
      would be of obvious value in developing appropriate service
      delivery and resource allocation models. Additionally,
      changing cultural attitudes and demographic shifts in the
      population have highlighted the pervasiveness of sexual
      concerns in all ethnic and age groups.</p>

      <p>The present study addresses these issues by analyzing data
      on sexual dysfunction from the National Health and Social
      Life Survey (NHSLS), a study of adult sexual behavior in the
      United States.[<a id="ref17" name="ref17" href="#n17">17</a>]
      Sampling, data collection, and response analysis were all
      conducted under highly controlled conditions. This unique
      data source provides extensive information on key aspects of
      sexual behavior, including sexual problems and dysfunction,
      health and lifestyle variables, and sociocultural predictors.
      Prior analyses of sexual dysfunction, using NHSLS data, are
      limited, presenting basic prevalence rates across demographic
      characteristics and indicators of overall health and
      well-being.[17(pp368-374)] The present study, in contrast,
      uses multivariate techniques to estimate relative risk (RR)
      of sexual dysfunction for each demographic characteristic as
      well as for key risk factors.</p>

      <h3>METHODS</h3>

      <h3>Survey</h3>

      <p>The NHSLS, conducted in 1992, is a national probability
      sample of 1410 men and 1749 women between the ages of 18 and
      59 years living in households throughout the United States.
      It accounts for about 97% of the population in this age
      range&mdash;roughly 150 million Americans. It excludes people
      living in group quarters such as barracks, college
      dormitories, and prisons, as well as those who do not know
      English well enough to be interviewed. The sample completion
      rate was greater than 79%. Checks with other high-quality
      samples (eg, US Census Bureau's Current Population Survey)
      indicated that the NHSLS succeeded in producing a truly
      representative sample of the population. Each respondent was
      surveyed in person by experienced interviewers, who matched
      respondents on various social attributes, for an interview
      averaging 90 minutes. Extensive discussion of the sampling
      design and evaluations of sample and data quality are found
      in the book by Laumann et al.[17(pp35-73,549-605)]</p>

      <p>Sexual dysfunction was indexed in this study according to
      7 dichotomous response items, each measuring presence of a
      critical symptom or problem during the past 12
      months.[17(p660)] Response items included: (1) lacking desire
      for sex; (2) arousal difficulties (ie, erection problems in
      men, lubrication difficulties in women); (3) inability
      achieving climax or ejaculation; (4) anxiety about sexual
      performance; (5) climaxing or ejaculating too rapidly; (6)
      physical pain during intercourse; and (7) not finding sex
      pleasurable. The last 3 items were asked only of respondents
      who were sexually active during the prior 12-month period.
      Taken together, these items cover the major problem areas
      addressed in the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
      Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition</i>[1] classification of
      sexual dysfunction. Self-reports about sexual dysfunctions,
      especially in face-to-face interviews, are subject to
      underreporting biases arising from personal concerns about
      social stigmatization. Moreover, there may be systematic
      biases in underreporting related to particular attributes of
      the respondents. For example, older or less educated women or
      younger Hispanic men might be more reluctant to report sexual
      problems. Lack of privacy during interviews could also result
      in underreporting. However, analyses (not reported herein)
      indicate that reporting biases due to lack of privacy are
      negligible in NHSLS data.[17(pp564-570)]</p>

      <p>A latent class analysis (LCA) was used to evaluate the
      syndromal clustering of individual sexual symptoms. Latent
      class analysis is a statistical method well suited for
      grouping categorical data into latent classes[<a id="ref18"
      name="ref18" href="#n18">18</a>,<a id="ref19" name="ref19"
      href="#n19">19</a>] and has a number of medical applications,
      such as evaluation of diagnostic systems[<a id="ref20"
      name="ref20" href="#n20">20-23</a>] and generation of
      epidemiologic estimates using symptom data.[<a id="ref24"
      name="ref24" href="#n24">24</a>,<a id="ref25" name="ref25"
      href="#n25">25</a>] Latent class analysis tests whether a
      latent variable, specified as a set of mutually exclusive
      classes, accounts for observed covariation among manifest,
      categorical variables. A more detailed discussion of this
      method is available on request from the authors. Since
      diagnostic criteria for disorders of sexual dysfunction
      involve a complex of symptoms, we used LCA for grouping
      symptoms into categories. These categories, then, represent a
      typology of disorders for sexual dysfunction found in the US
      population, indicating both prevalence and types of
      symptoms.</p>

      <p>We analyzed only those respondents reporting at least 1
      partner in the prior 12-month period. Respondents who were
      sexually inactive during this period were excluded. This
      procedure may limit our results because excluded respondents
      may have avoided sex because of sexual problems. However,
      this procedure was necessary to ensure that each respondent
      answered all the symptom items since 3 items were asked only
      of sexually active respondents. A total of 139 men and 238
      women were excluded on this basis. Excluded men were more
      likely to be single and have lower levels of education. We
      expect that this will bias our estimates of prevalence of
      sexual dysfunction downward since sexually inactive men
      generally reported higher rates of symptoms. Excluded women
      tended to be older and single. The exclusion of these women
      is likely to bias our estimates of the prevalence of sexual
      dysfunction upward given that these women tended to report
      lower rates.</p>

      <p>Analyses performed in this study were made by use of
      logistic and multinomial logistic regression. For assessing
      the prevalence of symptoms across demographic
      characteristics, we performed logistic regressions for each
      symptom. This approach produced adjusted odds ratios (ORs),
      which indicate the odds that members of a given social group
      (eg, never married) reported the symptom relative to a
      reference group (eg, currently married), while controlling
      for other demographic characteristics. Demographic
      characteristics included respondent's age, marital status,
      educational attainment level, and race and ethnicity. Next,
      while controlling for these characteristics, we estimated
      adjusted ORs using multinomial logistic regressions for 3
      sets of risk factors, each modeled separately in a nonnested
      manner. Risk factors associated with health and lifestyle
      included alcohol consumption, prior contraction of sexually
      transmitted diseases (STDs), presence of urinary tract
      symptoms, circumcision, health status, and experience of
      emotional or stress-related problems. Social status variables
      included change in income level and normative orientation,
      indexed by how liberal or conservative respondents' attitudes
      were toward sex. Risk factors associated with sexual
      experience included the number of lifetime sex partners,
      frequency of sex, how often respondents think about sex,
      frequency of masturbation, same sex contact, and experience
      in potentially traumatic events such as adult-child contact,
      forced sexual contact, sexual harassment, and abortion.
      Finally, we conducted a set of logistic regressions that used
      the categories of sexual dysfunction as predictor variables.
      These models measured the association between experience of
      dysfunction categories and quality-of-life concomitants,
      which included being satisfied personally and in
      relationships. We stress that concomitant outcomes cannot be
      causally linked as an outcome of sexual dysfunction. Latent
      class analyses were performed using maximum likelihood latent
      structure analysis.[<a id="ref26" name="ref26"
      href="#n26">26</a>] All logistic regressions used STATA
      version 5.0.[<a id="ref27" name="ref27" href="#n27">27</a>]
      Information regarding variable construction, LCA methods, and
      data quality are available from the authors.</p>

      <h3>RESULTS</h3>

      <h3>Prevalence of Sexual Problems</h3>

      <p>Use of NHSLS data allows for calculating national
      prevalence estimates of sexual problems for adult women and
      men. While NHSLS data on critical symptoms do not connote a
      clinical definition of sexual dysfunction, their prevalence
      does provide important information about their extent and
      differential distribution among the US population. <a
      id="tab1" name="tab1" href="80785t1a.htm">Table 1</a> and <a
      id="tab2" name="tab2" href="80785t2a.htm">Table 2</a> analyze
      the prevalencing sexual problems across selected demographic
      characteristics. For women, the prevalence of sexual problems
      tends to decrease with increasing age except for those who
      report trouble lubricating. Increasing age for men is
      positively associated with experience of erection problems
      and lacking desire for sex. The oldest cohort of men (ages
      50-59 years) is more than 3 times as likely to experience
      erection problems (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-7.0) and
      to report low sexual desire (95% CI, 1.6-5.4) in comparison
      to men aged 18 to 29 years. The prevalence of sexual problems
      also varies significantly across marital status. Premarital
      and postmarital (divorced, widowed, or separated) statuses
      are associated with elevated risk of experiencing sexual
      problems. Nonmarried women are roughly 1&frac12; times more
      likely to have climax problems (95% CI, 1.0-2.1 and 1.2-2.3,
      respectively) and sexual anxiety (95% CI, 1.0-2.4 and
      1.1-2.4, respectively) than married women. Similarly,
      nonmarried men report significantly higher rates for most
      symptoms of sexual dysfunction than married men. Thus,
      married women and men are clearly at lower risk of
      experiencing sexual symptoms than their nonmarried
      counterparts.</p>

      <p>High educational attainment is negatively associated with
      experience of sexual problems for both sexes. These
      differences are especially marked between women who do not
      have high school diplomas and those who have college degrees.
      Controlling for other demographic characteristics, women who
      have graduated from college are roughly half as likely to
      experience low sexual desire (95% CI, 0.3-0.8), problems
      achieving orgasm (95% CI, 0.3-0.7), sexual pain (95% CI,
      0.3-1.0), and sexual anxiety (95% CI, 0.3-1.0) as women who
      have not graduated from high school. Male college graduates
      are only two thirds (95% CI, 0.4-1.0) as likely to report
      climaxing too early and half as likely to report
      nonpleasurable sex (95% CI, 0.2-0.9) and sexual anxiety (95%
      CI, 0.3-0.8) than men who do not have high school diplomas.
      Overall, women and men with lower educational attainment
      report less pleasurable sexual experience and raised levels
      of sexual anxiety.</p>

      <p>The association between race and ethnicity and sexual
      problems is more variable. Black women tend to have higher
      rates of low sexual desire and experience less pleasure
      compared with white women, who are more likely to have sexual
      pain than black women. Hispanic women, in contrast,
      consistently report lower rates of sexual problems.
      Differences between men are not as marked but are generally
      consistent with what women experience. Indeed, although the
      effects of race and ethnicity are fairly modest among both
      sexes, blacks appear more likely to have sexual problems
      while Hispanics are less likely to have sexual problems,
      across the categories of sexual dysfunction.</p>

      <h3>Latent Class Analysis</h3>

      <p>The results of LCA allow for analyzing risk factors and
      quality-of-life concomitants in relation to categories of
      sexual dysfunction, rather than individual symptoms. Analyses
      presented in <a id="tab3" name="tab3"
      href="80785t3.htm">Table 3</a>, <a id="tab4" name="tab4"
      href="80785t4.htm">Table 4</a>, and <a id="tab5" name="tab5"
      href="80785t5.htm">Table 5</a> use the results of LCA instead
      of individual symptoms. These results indicate that the
      clustering of symptoms according to syndrome can be
      represented by 4 categories for women as well as for men.
      Latent class analysis also estimates the size of each class
      as a proportion of the total sample, a result corresponding
      to prevalence of categories of sexual dysfunction in the US
      population. Finally, LCA identifies each class's symptoms,
      indicating the likelihood that respondents in that class will
      exhibit a given symptom, thus providing researchers with
      information about what elements characterize each category.
      Although not equivalent to clinical diagnosis, this approach
      offers a statistical representation of sexual
      dysfunction.</p>

      <p>For women, the 4 categories identified by LCA roughly
      correspond to major disorders of sexual dysfunction as
      outlined by the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
      Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition</i>.[1] These include an
      unaffected group (58% prevalence), a low sexual desire
      category (22% prevalence), a category for arousal problems
      (14% prevalence), and a group with sexual pain (7%
      prevalence). Similarly, a large proportion of men (70%
      prevalence) constitutes an unaffected population. The
      remaining categories consist of premature ejaculation (21%
      prevalence), erectile dysfunction (5% prevalence), and low
      sexual desire (5% prevalence). Overall, the results of LCA
      show that the total prevalence of sexual dysfunction is
      higher for women than men (43% vs 31%).</p>

      <h3>Risk Factors</h3>

      <p>Tables 3 and 4 present multinomial logistic regressions on
      categories of sexual dysfunction. Adjusted ORs indicate the
      relative risk of experiencing a given category of sexual
      dysfunction vs reporting no problems for each risk factor,
      while controlling for other characteristics. With regard to
      health and lifestyle risk factors, those who experience
      emotional or stress-related problems are more likely to
      experience sexual dysfunctions defined in each of the
      categories. In contrast, health problems affect women and men
      differently. Men with poor health have elevated risk for all
      categories of sexual dysfunction, whereas this factor is only
      associated with sexual pain for women. The presence of
      urinary tract symptoms appears to impact sexual function only
      (eg, arousal and pain disorders for women or erectile
      dysfunction for men). Finally, having had an STD, moderate to
      high alcohol consumption, and circumcision generally do not
      result in increased odds of experiencing sexual
      dysfunction.</p>

      <p>Social status variables, which measure an individual's
      socioeconomic and normative position relative to other
      persons, assess how sociocultural position affects sexual
      function. Deterioration in economic position, indexed by
      falling household income, is generally associated with a
      modest increase in risk for all categories of sexual
      dysfunction for women but only erectile dysfunction for men.
      Normative orientation does not appear to have any impact on
      sexual dysfunction for women; men with liberal attitudes
      about sex, in contrast, are approximately 1&frac34; times
      more likely to experience premature ejaculation (95% CI,
      1.2-2.5).</p>

      <p>Finally, various aspects of sexual experience result in an
      increased risk of sexual dysfunction. Sexual history,
      indicated by having more than 5 lifetime partners and by
      masturbation practices, does not increase relative risk for
      either women or men. Women with low sexual activity or
      interests, however, have elevated risk for low sexual desire
      and arousal disorders. Men do not exhibit similar
      associations. The impact of potentially traumatic sexual
      events is markedly different for women and men. Women
      respondents reporting any same-sex activity are not at higher
      risk for sexual dysfunction, while men are. Men reporting any
      same-sex activity are more than twice as likely to experience
      premature ejaculation (95% CI, 1.2-3.9) and low sexual desire
      (95% CI, 1.1-5.7) than men who have not. Arousal disorder
      appears to be highly associated in women who have experienced
      sexual victimization through adult-child contact or forced
      sexual contact. Similarly, male victims of adult-child
      contact are 3 times as likely to experience erectile
      dysfunction (95% CI, 1.5-6.6) and approximately 2 times as
      likely to experience premature ejaculation (95% CI, 1.2-2.9)
      and low sexual desire (95% CI, 1.1-4.6) than those who have
      not been victims of adult-child contact. Finally, men who
      have sexually assaulted women are 3&frac12; times as likely
      to report erectile dysfunction (95% CI, 1.0-12.0). Indeed,
      traumatic sexual acts continue to exert profound effects on
      sexual functioning, some effects lasting many years beyond
      the occurrence of the original event.</p>

      <h3>Quality-of-Life Concomitants</h3>

      <p>The experience of sexual dysfunction is highly associated
      with a number of unsatisfying personal experiences and
      relationships. Table 5 highlights the associations of
      categories of sexual dysfunction with emotional and physical
      satisfaction with sexual partners and with feelings of
      general happiness. However, no causal order should be assumed
      since quality-of-life indicators are concomitant outcomes of
      sexual dysfunction. For women, all categories of sexual
      dysfunction&mdash;low sexual desire, arousal disorder, sexual
      pain&mdash;have strong positive associations with low
      feelings of physical and emotional satisfaction and low
      feelings of happiness. Similar to women, men with erectile
      dysfunction and low sexual desire experience diminished
      quality of life, but those with premature ejaculation are not
      affected. In brief, experience of sexual dysfunction is
      generally associated with poor quality of life; however,
      these negative outcomes appear to be more extensive and
      possibly more severe for women than men. In an examination of
      help-seeking behavior (analysis not shown here, but available
      on request), we found that roughly 10% and 20% of these
      afflicted men and women, respectively, sought medical
      consultation for their sexual problems.</p>

      <h3>COMMENT</h3>

      <p>Demographic factors such as age are strongly predictive of
      sexual difficulties, particularly erectile dysfunction.
      Sexual problems are most common among young women and older
      men. Several factors may explain these differential rates.
      Since young women are more likely to be single, their sexual
      activities involve higher rates of partner turnover as well
      as periodic spells of sexual inactivity. This instability,
      coupled with inexperience, generates stressful sexual
      encounters, providing the basis for sexual pain and anxiety.
      Young men are not similarly affected. Older men are more
      likely to have trouble maintaining or achieving an erection
      as well as to lack an interest in sex. Low sexual interest
      and erection problems are age-dependent disorders, possibly
      resulting from physiological changes associated with the
      aging process. Indeed, our results are consistent with those
      generated by the MMAS, which determined that 9.6% of its
      sample experienced complete impotence and showed a strong age
      association increasing from 5% to 15% between subject ages of
      40 and 70 years.[7]</p>

      <p>Other factors such as poor health and lifestyle are
      differentially predictive across demographic groups. While
      nonmarital status is associated with lower overall
      well-being, part of the higher risk of sexual dysfunction
      probably stems from differences in sexual lifestyles.
      Similarly, elevated risks associated with low educational
      attainment and minority status attest to the fact that
      better-educated individuals are healthier and have lifestyles
      that are physically and emotionally less stressful. To
      understand the factors that predispose individuals to sexual
      dysfunction, we should analyze risk factors.</p>

      <p>The NHSLS data indicate that emotional and stress-related
      problems among women and men generate elevated risk of
      experiencing sexual difficulties in all phases of the sexual
      response cycle. While we caution that the causal order of
      this relationship is uncertain, these results suggest that
      psychosocial disturbances affect sexual functioning. This
      does not imply that the impact of poor health is negligible;
      in fact, the opposite is demonstrated since age, health
      problems, and urinary tract infections result in elevated
      risk of experiencing sexual dysfunction. Rather, both
      physiological and psychological statuses are independent
      factors that affect sexual functioning.</p>

      <p>Given the salience of emotional distress on sexual
      dysfunction, we examine 2 underlying sources of psychosocial
      stress: social status and sexual trauma. The NHSLS data
      clearly suggest that deteriorating social position negatively
      affects sexual functioning. Deterioration in economic
      position induces higher levels of stress, which in turn
      affects sexual functioning, a result more pervasive among
      women than men. Future research should be directed toward
      mapping the social distribution of emotional distress.</p>

      <p>With respect to possibly traumatic sexual experiences, our
      findings are complex and show distinct differences between
      sexes but clearly provide evidence that these experiences are
      sources of psychosocial stress. First, we found that the
      impact of same-sex activity is relevant for men but not
      women. The source of this difference may be rooted in the
      subjective meaning of these sex acts, because many
      male-to-male encounters have involved adult-child contact. We
      should note that these results assess the impact of
      historical instances of same-sex activity, not the
      relationship between homosexuality and sexual problems.
      Similarly, indicators for sexual victimization show strong
      effects in persons of both sexes. For women, adult-child
      contact or forced sex, both generally perpetrated by men,
      results in increased risk of experiencing arousal disorders.
      These results support the view that sexual traumas induce
      lasting psychosocial disturbances, which ultimately affect
      sexual functioning.[<a id="ref28" name="ref28"
      href="#n28">28</a>] Similarly, men who were touched sexually
      before puberty also are more likely to experience all
      categories of sexual dysfunction. In short, both female and
      male victims of unwanted sexual contact exhibit long-term
      changes in sexual functioning.</p>

      <p>While the causal relationship between quality-of-life
      concomitants and sexual dysfunction also remains to be
      investigated, the strong associations observed in NHSLS data
      suggest that sexual dysfunction is a largely uninvestigated
      yet significant public health problem. Recent advances in
      therapy for erectile dysfunction may increase quality of life
      for some men. However, since low well-being is strongly
      associated with female sexual problems, researchers should
      focus on identifying the consequences of these problems as
      well as developing appropriate therapies. With the affected
      population rarely receiving medical therapy for sexual
      dysfunction, service delivery efforts should be augmented to
      target high-risk populations.</p>

      <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

      <p>This report provides the first population-based assessment
      of sexual dysfunction in the half-century since Kinsey et
      al.[<a id="ref29" name="ref29" href="#n29">29</a>,<a
      id="ref30" name="ref30" href="#n30">30</a>] The results from
      the NHSLS indicate that sexual problems are widespread in
      society and are influenced by both health-related and
      psychosocial factors. The role of the latter implies that
      stress-inducing events, due to either individual or social
      sources, can affect sexual functioning in both men and women.
      Differing patterns of sexual dysfunction were observed across
      sex, age, and demographic groups, highlighting the need for
      further research on etiologic mechanisms. With the strong
      association between sexual dysfunction and impaired quality
      of life, this problem warrants recognition as a significant
      public health concern.</p>
