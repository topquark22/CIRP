      </blockquote>

      <p><b>By David A. Grimes</b></p>

      <p>Routine circumcision of the newborn, a controversial
      procedure, has ethical, medical, economic, and psychological
      significance for all Americans. No other operation today is
      performed so often for such poorly understood reasons on such
      unwilling patients in such unlikely settings.</p>

      <p>Questioning the value of any routine procedure that is
      accepted unquestioningly is both prudent and healthy(<a
      href="#n1">1</a>). This is particularly true for routine
      circumcisions because of our lack of knowledge about
      prevention of penile ailments.</p>

      <p>Clinical impressions and untested hypotheses have governed
      the practice of nontherapeutic circumcision since its
      emergence in Africa over 5,000 years ago(<a
      href="#n2">2</a>). Even today, little scientific knowledge is
      available. Since nurses play a critical role in caring for
      newborns, they need to be aware of the controversy regarding
      circumcision in order to counsel families more effectively
      about potential benefits and risks of this operation.</p>

      <p>Which newborns should undergo circumcision and why? It is
      difficult to identify candidates for circumcision since the
      foreskin of 96 percent of newborn males cannot be
      retracted(<a href="#n3">3</a>). Thus, phimosis - inability to
      retract the foreskin, which protects the glans, shares a
      common epithelium with the latter. As boys get older,
      separation of this epithelium gradually and progressively
      occurs, so that by age 16 to 17, phimosis occurs in only one
      percent of uncircumcised males(<a href="#n4">4</a>).</p>

      <p>Selection of candidates for surgery is based primarily on
      the mother's wishes. Fathers generally take little interest
      in the circumcision decision(<a href="#n1">1,5</a>). The
      reasons mothers give for deciding to have their sons
      circumcised suggest that the decision is often irrational. In
      one study, parents' reason for circumcision included
      prevention of "rupture," masturbation, or excessive crying(<a
      href="#n5">5</a>). In another study, mothers had their sons
      circumcised because they believed that all males are
      circumcised, that the circumcision is required by law, that
      circumcision is mandatory hospital policy, or the the penis
      would be rendered more aesthetic(<a href="#n6">6</a>). Other
      reasons include advice from women's magazines and the belief
      that circumcision is required for admission to the armed
      forces.</p>

      <p>Circumcision probably facilitates cleaning the penis. But
      is cleanliness a legitimate indication for surgery? Less
      drastic measures can usually suffice. Children are
      customarily taught the use of toilets toothbrushes, soap and
      water, and instructions in cleaning the genitals may be an
      effective alternative to surgery(<a href="#n7">7</a>).</p>

      <p>Circumcision may decrease the risk of cancer of the penis,
      a rare disease in the U.S. Lack of circumcision has been
      associated with cancer of the penis, but more importantly, so
      has lack of hygiene(<a href="#n7">7,8</a>). Carcinoma of the
      penis is uncommon in men with good hygiene, but circumcision
      affords little protection where hygiene is poor. No good data
      support a relationship between lack of circumcision and
      cancer of the prostate or cancer of the cervix in females.(<a
      href="#n7">7</a>).</p>

      <p>Circumcision may help boys feel "regular," since most
      American males are circumcised(<a href="#n9">9</a>). That
      male with normal body anatomy should be embarrassed in a
      locker room suggests that the cultural norms may be
      distorted, rather than the genitalia in question.</p>

      <p>Circumcision of the newborn takes less time and costs less
      than circumcision of adults, and it avoids the risk of
      anesthesia associated with the latter. The relative safety of
      circumcision at these times, however, is unknown.</p>

      <p>Is routine circumcision of the newborn economically wise?
      Assuming that 83 percent of the 1,613,000 boys born in the
      United States in 1975, approximately 1,339,000 newborn's
      foreskins were removed that year (<a href="#n10">10,11</a>).
      If only one percent of those newborns would have subsequently
      developed clinically significant phimosis, then 16,000 might
      have required circumcision later in life(<a
      href="#n4">4</a>).</p>

      <p>Circumcisions on newborns are done without any anesthesia.
      Obviously this eliminates the risks of anesthesia, but this
      practice recalls a more primitive era of medicine. Extending
      this practice to other procedures, we might envision patients
      being denied anesthesia during biopsies, vasectomies, or
      dental extractions.</p>

      <p>Some babies die from circumcision, although the risk is
      small - approximately two deaths per million procedures.(<a
      href="#n12">12</a>). Many more babies suffer complications.
      Estimates of morbidity range form 0.06 percent to 55 percent,
      reflecting wide differences in definitions and followups(<a
      href="#n5">5,12</a>). One study reported an incidence of
      significant complications, such as life threatening
      hemorrhage, or completed denudation of the penile shaft of
      one per 500 circumcisions.(<a href="#n13">13</a>).</p>

      <p>Three types of complications predominate: hemorrhage,
      infection, and surgical trauma(<a href="#n14">14</a>).
      Bleeding may require suturing or transfusion. Wound infection
      can lead to scarring, deformity, and phimosis. Exposed to the
      ammonia of wet diapers, the unprotected glans may develop a
      meatal ulceration, which can lead to meatal stenosis.
      Surgical mishaps remain a problem often because the operation
      is referred to the least qualified surgeons - medical
      students and junior house staff.(<a href="#n15">15</a>)</p>

      <p>Other complications include iatrogenic microphallus
      (concealed penis), denudation of the shaft, incomplete
      circumcision with subsequent deformity, lacerated scrotum,
      subglanular fistula, bivalved, grooved or amputated glans,
      and cautery burns(<a href="#n14">14</a>). A tragic example of
      the last complication led to sloughing of most of the penis
      of a four-month-old. After two years and a number of
      unsuccessful attempts to reconstruct the penis, the patient
      was surgically changed to a female.(<a
      href="#n13">13</a>).</p>

      <p>Circumcision also affects infant behavior and
      psychobiology. One group of researchers documented changes in
      newborns' sleep patterns after circumcision(<a
      href="#n16">16</a>). This may be due to the stress of the
      experience. Others observed an immediate and significant
      increase in wakefulness, especially fussy crying after the
      procedure(<a href="#n17">17</a>). In addition, the responses
      of circumcised males to auditory stimulation are different
      from those on noncircumcised males or females. These
      responses include more time awake and agitated(<a
      href="#n18">18</a>). The endocrine response of newborns to
      circumcision supports the behavioral evidence that the
      operation is stressful; significant increases in plasma
      cortisol have been noted 20 minutes and 40 minutes after
      circumcision(<a href="#n19">19</a>).</p>

      <p>Potential long-term psychological consequences are not
      known. This lack of information is particularly troubling
      since the human brain is especially vulnerable to both
      exogenous and endogenous influences during the interval from
      the latter part of pregnancy to about 18 months of age. Since
      animal studies reveal long-term behavioral, physiological,
      anatomical, and neuro-phamacological effects of minor events
      in early life, the effects of circumcision on newborns should
      not be considered short-lived in the absence of evidence to
      the contrary. Even if the effects were short-lived, they
      might alter early parent-child interactions and hence later
      development(<a href="#n10">10</a>).</p>

      <p>In 1975, the American Academy of Pediatrics reaffirmed its
      position that there are no valid medical indication for
      circumcision of newborns. "A program of education leading to
      good personal hygiene would offer all the advantages of
      circumcision without the attendant surgical risk"(<a
      href="#n20">20</a>).</p>
