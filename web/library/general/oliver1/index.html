      <p><b>Circumcision and cruelty to children</b></p>

      <p class="justify">S<font
      size="1">IR</font>,&mdash;Conscientous surgeons and
      paediatricians have listed the complications of neonatal
      circumcision both in this journal (<a
      href="/library/complications/fleiss3/">Drs P M Fleiss and J
      Douglass</a> (1 September, p 554)) and in other scientific
      papers. Without anaesthetic the operation in babies causes
      pain, intense and prolonged crying, air swallowing, vomiting
      sometimes followed by apnoea and sometimes permanent local
      complications. With anaesthetic the procedure should
      <i>not</i> be considered minor because of both local and
      anaesthetic complications. There is a small risk of death
      following circumcision, which means that there must be
      clear-cut immediate medical indications to justify that risk.
      Some arguments in favour of circumcision for long-term
      reasons smack of sophistry.</p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drs
      Fleiss and Douglass dispassionately described a cruel
      practice. If circumcision without anaesthetic had not been
      sanctioned by authority, there would be grounds for criminal
      prosecution of the operator for inflicting unnecessary
      cruelty, and grounds (in the UK) for a care order removing
      the child from parental authority. Indeed, such action has
      been taken in the UK against parents who inflict bizarre (but
      less common) tribal mutilations on their young children.
      Doctors do not supervise or administer facial cicatrisation
      (with the appropriate sterile precautions and antibiotics) to
      help the child identify with his ancestral tribe. They do not
      remove toes because of a long-term risk of bunions, ingrowing
      toenails, or toe cancer.</p>

      <p class="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If
      circumcision for non-medical reasons has died out in
      Scandinavia and is dying out in the UK, why has the practice
      persisted in parts of the UK and much of the United States?
      Do religious and social pressures perpetuate unnecessary
      circumcision (or any other unnecessary mutilation or
      operation)? It may be true that the stress to a child in a
      Moslem enclave in the UK would be great if he were excluded
      from being the same as his peers, and made a pariah from his
      group. If this is correct, cannot circumcision for religious
      (or social) reasons be delayed until 16 years when the young
      man can take the positive decision? He may then be determined
      to accept risk and pain for the sake of his beliefs. It just
      seems wrong for authority to continue to encourage certain
      parents to subject <i>young</i> children to unnecessary risk,
      pain, and distress, and for <i>young</i> children to be
      denied any protection from the law just because a malpractice
      is rather common.</p>
