      <b>SECOND OPINION</b> 

      <h2>Circumcision: Another Look</h2>

      <p>By George K. Hughes, MD</p>

      <p>There have been recent concerns about the necessity of
      circumcision on the newborn. One idea in favor of newborn
      circumcision is in the area of infection. There have been
      some articles that indicate urinary tract infection is more
      common in the uncircumcised infant. Another deterrent to
      circumcision has to do with sexually related diseases. John
      G. Swadey, MD (New England Journal of Medicine, 1987) states
      that circumcised men show a "somewhat higher incidence of
      genital warts, nongonococcal urethritis and scabies." A. J.
      Fink, MD (New England Journal of Medicine, 1986) gave a
      hypothesis that "the presence of a foreskin predisposes both
      the heterosexual and homosexual men to the acquisition of
      AIDS." However, Robert W. Enzenauer, MD (New England Journal
      of Medicine, 1987) refutes this hypothesis. He also states
      that Dr. Fink's statement, "both genital herpes and syphilis
      are more common in the uncircumcised man," is not a foregone
      conclusion. Some believe the pain involved with circumcision
      may be a contraindication. The question of carcinoma has been
      presented in relation to circumcision. In an article by
      Benjamin Spock (<a
      href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/info/spock.html"
       target="_blank">Redbook, 1989</a>) he argues against the
      necessity of circumcision. He cites three reasons why
      circumcision is being questioned for the newborn: 1. pain
      baby experiences; 2. Risks involved in performing the
      procedure; 3. Whether the procedure actually prevents
      disease. He further states that circumcision was once
      recommended because "women married to uncircumcised men were
      more likely to develop cancer of the cervix." However, 10
      years later this opinion has changed.</p>

      <p>We recently conducted a survey to try to determine if
      there is a difference between the sexual sensitivity of men
      who have been circumcised and those who were uncircumcised.
      Questionnaires were sent to 1,500 men who had been married to
      the same spouse for over 50 years. These were sent out to
      learn if there could be some degree of difference in the
      sexual sensitivity or degree of sexual compatibility between
      the circumcised and uncircumcised male. Approximately 70% of
      the respondents were uncircumcised, while approximately 30%
      were circumcised.</p>

      <p>Our survey suggests that there is a difference between the
      sexuality of the circumcised and uncircumcised male during
      his lifetime. It also suggests that the uncircumcised male
      has a more favorable sexual compatibility in his
      marriage.</p>

      <p>During my experiences in medicine and surgery,
      occasionally there arose the question of circumcision and
      sexual compatibility. It seemed to me that the uncircumcised
      male had less of a problem in sexual compatibility. This
      observation led me to conduct the survey. I was assisted in
      this survey by Cynthia Pomeroy, BS.</p>

      <p>It is now my opinion that we have an additional argument
      against circumcision. It would also appear that this
      information would outweigh all other arguments in favor of
      circumcision.</p>
