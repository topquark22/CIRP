      <h2>THE QUESTION OF ROUTINE NEONATAL CIRCUMCISION</h2>
      <b>Ronald L. Poland, M. D.</b>
    </div>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R<span>OUTINE</span>
      neonatal circumcision is the subject of much debate in the
      United States. The practice has attracted passionate
      advocates and critics. The analysis presented here examines
      the available medical evidence relating to routine neonatal
      circumcision in order to weigh its risks, costs, and
      benefits. This assessment is meant to help clinicians
      formulate their own recommendations about the advisability of
      prophylactic neonatal circumcision.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the approximately
      1.95 million boys born in the United States during 1987, 1.19
      million, or 61 percent were circumcised, according to the
      National Center for Health Statistics. Fees paid to
      physicians range between $75 and $100, and most hospitals do
      not charge separately for circumcision. In states that use
      the Medicaid prospective payment system, the facility's
      charges for circumcision are part of a single payment to
      hospitals for the care of a normal newborn infant. Some
      private insurance plans reimburse physicians for the
      procedure and others do not. The reimbursement of physicians
      for circumcisions performed on patients covered by medical
      assistance or Medicaid in Pennsylvania or Michigan ranges
      from $20 to $28, and each state has its own payment
      structure. About 30 percent of all newborns were insured
      though Medicaid programs in 1988, according to state reports.
      The cost of universal circumcision in the United States would
      therefore be about $140 million a year.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relatively few medical
      procedures are routinely recommended for the care of infants
      and children. In general, the risks that stem from not
      undergoing a procedure must be substantial, and the risks and
      costs of undergoing it relatively small. Procedures that
      satisfy these requirements include the intramuscular
      administration of vitamin K for the prevention of hemorrhagic
      disease of the newborn and immunizations against polio,
      diphtheria, and measles. Influenza vaccine on the other hand,
      is recommended only for children in high risk groups, such as
      those with chronic pulmonary disease, since the risk of
      influenza in otherwise healthy children is not considered
      high enough to justify the minimal risks of vaccination.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></font> A good general
      rule is to withhold the routine application of procedures to
      large groups of people unless it is clear that the benefits
      far outweigh the risks and costs. Is this principle satisfied
      for routine neonatal circumcision?</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate risks of
      neonatal circumcision are small. Any operative procedure,
      including circumcision, may be accompanied by infection of
      the wound or excessive bleeding. Wiswell and Geschke<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></font> found a rate
      of early complications (mostly local infection and bleeding)
      or 0.19 percent for routine infant circumcision of 136,086
      boys. Since their data were collected retrospectively and
      included only diagnoses entered on inpatient records, they
      recognized, that they might have underestimated the rate of
      complications. Sporadic cases of operative misadventure have
      been reported in which the glans penis was damaged or
      partially amputated, or too much skin was removed from the
      shaft of the penis.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup></font> Meatal ulceration and meatal
      stenosis have also been described consequences of neonatal
      circumcision.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></font> Most of these complications are
      treatable and have no long term consequences, although there
      have been rare cases of gender reassignment due to surgical
      error. Pain and physiologic evidence of stress accompany
      neonatal circumcision when no anesthesia is administered.
      These problems can be alleviated by the use of regional
      anesthesia such as dorsal penile nerve block.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></font> However we
      have no reliable estimate of the risks, either short- or
      long-term, of administering dorsal nerve block to large
      numbers of newborns. There is a need for more information
      about the safety of penile nerve block and perhaps safer
      techniques that alleviate the pain of circumcision. In
      summary there is little controversy about the magnitude of
      the operative risk: in experienced hands, circumcision
      involves a very low but not completely negligible risk.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The controversy
      resides instead in estimating the benefits that may accrue
      from routine neonatal circumcision. Many benefits have been
      postulated. For example, it has been said that neonatal
      circumcision facilitates the maintenance of genital
      hygiene<font size="2"><sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></font>
      and may prevent local infections such as balanoposthitis
      (inflammation of the glans and foreskin),<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></font> urinary tract
      infections,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n7">7-9</a></sup></font> and venereal diseases.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></font> In addition,
      it has been claimed that in circumcised men and their female
      partners, carcinoma of the penis and uterine cervix are less
      prevalent.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n6">6,11</a></sup></font> What is the evidence for
      such reported benefits.?</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facilitation of
      cleanliness has been proposed as an argument for routine
      infant circumcision. It is difficult to understand, however,
      how maintaining cleanliness in an infant could be enhanced by
      routine circumcision. The booklet of the American Academy of
      Pediatrics on the care of the uncircumcised penis<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup></font> recommends
      no special cleaning of the foreskin other than than involved
      in regular bathing. It states "The uncircumcised penis is
      easy to keep clean. No special care is required!" The
      foreskin is seldom retractable at birth, and full spontaneous
      separation of the foreskin may not occur until the age of
      five. Retracting the foreskin should not be painful, and
      forced retraction should be avoided. Once full retraction can
      be carried out with ease, only occasional retraction and
      cleaning are recommended until puberty. At puberty boys
      should be instructed to clean under the foreskin as part of
      each bath or shower.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n12">12,13</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, neither
      posthitis (inflammation of the foreskin) nor paraphimosis
      (constriction of the glans by retraction and swelling of an
      inflamed foreskin can occur in circumcised men and boys.
      Balanitis (inflammation of the glans penis can occur in those
      who are circumcised as well as those who are not. It has been
      reported that 5 to 10 percent of those not circumcised at
      birth eventually undergo circumcision for one of these
      problems,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n6">6,14</a></sup></font> but it is difficult to
      confirm this contention with recent data. In a prospective
      study covering the eight years of life, 146 boys in New
      Zealand had an 11.1 percent incidence of penile problems,
      such as inflammation or inadequate circumcision, as compared
      with an 18.8 percent incidence of similar problems (e. g.,
      inflammation or phimosis) among 445 uncircumcised boys
      (difference not significant).<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n15">15</a></sup></font> Thus, circumcision may reduce
      the incidence of penile inflammatory disorders but proper
      hygiene will probably have a similar benefit.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several recent reports
      have linked an increased incidence of urinary tract infection
      with the uncircumcised state.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n7">7-9</a></sup></font> In retrospective studies,
      Wiswell et al. reported that boys who were not circumcised
      had a 10- to 20- fold higher risk of urinary tract
      infections.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n7">7,8</a></sup></font> Herzog's study excluded
      almost half the original cohort from the data analysis, and
      this may have biased the findings. It would be very difficult
      to perform a randomized, controlled trial of the effects of
      neonatal circumcision on the incidence of urinary tract
      infection. However, these retrospective studies depended
      heavily on the coding of inpatient medical records which did
      not count urinary tract infection treated outside the
      hospital,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n7">7,8</a></sup></font> and did not consider
      potentially important confounding variables such as physician
      bias concerning the association between the uncircumcised
      state and urinary tract infection,<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n7">7-9</a></sup></font> leaving us in doubt as to
      whether all important sources of bias were examined. Their
      main conclusion - that circumcision helps prevent urinary
      tract infection is also in doubt. These problems underline
      the need for a well planned, prospective, population based
      surveillance study to document whether the protective effect
      of circumcision against urinary tract infection is
      genuine.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been proposed
      that circumcision may protect men from infection with the
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Two recent reports<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n16">16,17</a></sup></font> concluded
      that uncircumcised men exposed to HIV during heterosexual
      intercourse appeared to be more susceptible to infection. The
      presence of a penile ulcer was found to be as important, or
      more important, as a risk factor for seroconversion. The data
      collected were collected in a clinic for venereal disease in
      Kenya, where the heterosexual transmission of HIV appears to
      be more prevalent than in North America. In these studies,
      the uncircumcised men came from areas of the country in which
      HIV was endemic, and the circumcised men came from areas of
      lower risk. Which is cause and which effect remains unknown.
      Many of the studies' conclusions depended upon retrospective
      data, and again, important sources of bias may have obscured
      the true contribution of circumcision to the risk of the
      transmission of HIV. We must remember that circumcision is
      not performed randomly; it is more common in certain
      socioeconomic, ethnic, and religious groups. Jews and Muslims
      are circumcised for religious reasons. In the United States
      circumcision is less common among the poor and among Hispanic
      Americans. In Japan and Sweden, neonatal circumcision is not
      performed routinely. These demographic factors may in turn be
      associated with sexual practices and exposures that have a
      significant effect on the incidence of HIV infection.
      Nevertheless, the studies cited do suggest that HIV may be
      more infective during heterosexual intercourse if the male
      partner is uncircumcised and has a mucosal or cutaneous
      ulcer. In preventing the transmission of HIV, however,
      circumcision is unlikely to be as effective as limiting the
      number of sexual contacts or using condoms properly.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested
      that circumcision prevents cancer of the penis and of the
      uterine cervix.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n6">6,11</a></sup></font> Both kinds of cancer are
      associated with genital infection with specific types of
      human papillamoviruses.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n18">18</a></sup></font> It has been alleged that
      cancer of the penis is virtually unknown among men
      circumcised in infancy. However penile carcinomas have in
      fact been reported among circumcised men.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup></font> The
      incidence of cancer of the penis in the United States, where
      most men have been circumcised at birth, is reported to be
      between 0 and 2.1 per 100,000, representing less than 1
      percent of all cancers in men.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup></font> This incidence of penile
      cancer is similar to the rates in Denmark (1.1 per 100,0000
      and Japan (0.3 per 100,0000 where neonatal circumcision is
      not routinely performed.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n20">20</a></sup></font> One study, reporting
      contradictory data, claimed that the lifetime risk in
      American men is 1 in 600.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n21">21</a></sup></font> This estimate was
      extrapolated from a study of the incidence of male
      circumcision<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n22">22</a></sup></font> and depended on three
      incorrect assumptions: that all penile carcinomas occur in
      men who are not circumcised at birth, that the circumcision
      rate between 1890 and 1905 was the same as that in 1959, and
      that men presenting at a cancer detection center in Los
      Angeles, 40 percent of whom were classified as professionals
      or managers, were representative of the U.S. male population.
      Thus the lifetime risk of cancer reported in this study is
      probably incorrect. The evidence that penile cancer has a
      viral cause and the disease's similar incidence rates in
      countries with very different rates of circumcision cast
      doubt on the proposition that circumcision is the most
      effective way to prevent cancer of the penis.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cervical cancer
      presents epidemiological similarities to venereal diseases.
      It is more prevalent among the poor, blacks, and Hispanic
      Americans. In addition to socioeconomic factors, sexual
      behavior (sexual activity at an early age and multiple
      partners) smoking, the low intake of certain micronutrients,
      the use of hormonal contraceptives, and infection with
      sexually transmitted diseases have been identified as risk
      factors for cervical cancer.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n23">23</a></sup></font> Among the sexually
      transmitted diseases that may be risk factors, human
      papillomaviruses, herpes simplex type 2 virus,
      cytomegalovirus, Trichomona vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis,
      spirochetes, Neisseria gonorrhoae and Mycoplasma hominis have
      all been suspected.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n11">11,24</a></sup></font> Venereal transmission is
      further supported by the observation that the wives of men
      with penile cancer have a significantly increased risk of
      cervical cancer. Also the subsequent wives of men whose
      previous wives had cervical cancer have significantly higher
      rates than women in the general population.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n23">23</a></sup></font> At present,
      human papillomaviruses, especially types 16 and 18, appear to
      play a part in the pathogenesis of the disease.<font
      size="2"><sup><a href="#n23">23,24</a></sup></font> Once
      again, studies have correlated exposure to uncircumcised
      sexual partners with the incidence of cervical cancer, but
      the circumcised state is also associated with the presence of
      human papillomavirus and other possibly oncogenic viruses. It
      is thus difficult to sort out a cause-and-effect
      relation.<font size="2"><sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the risks
      of circumcision are very small when the procedure is done by
      an experienced practitioner. The cost of routine infant
      circumcision is substantial and must be considered in making
      public health recommendations. The benefits of routine
      circumcision may include a reduced rate of urinary tract
      infection in infancy. As noted the studies that considered
      this issue were retrospective and may not have eliminated
      important sources of bias. These studies are important and
      very useful in generating hypotheses, but they cannot be
      considered to offer proof of benefit. Confirming the effect
      of circumcision on the incidence of urinary tract infection
      will require well designed studies that follow entire cohorts
      of circumcised and uncircumcised subjects from birth.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the risks of
      routine neonatal circumcision are small, the benefits appear
      to be uncertain. It therefore seems prudent to consider
      neonatal circumcision a procedure to be performed at the
      discretion of the parents not as a part of routine medical
      care. Omitting circumcision in the newborn period should not
      be considered to be medical neglect. Parents should be
      informed of the current state of medical knowledge regarding
      the risks and benefits of the procedure. Their ultimate
      decision may hinge on nonmedical considerations.</p>
