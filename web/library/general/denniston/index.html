      <h1>Unnecessary Circumcision</h1>
      <b>George C. Denniston, <small>M.D., MPH</small><br />
       President,<br />
       Population Dynamics<br />
       Seattle, Washington</b><br />

      <blockquote>
        <p><b>In many hospitals, circumcision has become a routine
        part of the care provided for male infants. This author
        contends that it is time for the medical establishment to
        rethink both the reasons for and the consequences of this
        procedure.</b><br />
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>In recent years, the debate on circumcision has been
      conducted on a relatively low plane, with proponents arguing
      that circumcision may prevent some unusual or rare
      conditions. Opponents of circumcision argue that it has no
      medical benefits. This article seeks to simplify the subject
      and raise it to a higher plane&mdash;focusing on the positive
      value of the intact foreskin.</p>

      <p><b>Physiology</b></p>

      <p>Before birth, the glans penis is covered with skin. This
      skin is not loosely attached; indeed, it is as tightly
      attached to the glans as is the skin on the hand, for
      example.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p>At approximately 17 weeks' gestation, cells in the area of
      separation between the future foreskin and the glans initiate
      the process of creating the preputial space (ie, the space
      between the glans penis and the intact foreskin). They begin
      to form microscopic balls comprising multiple layers of
      cells. As these whorls of cells enlarge, cells at the center
      are cut off from nutrients; they die and create a space.
      These minute spaces coalesce, eventually becoming the
      preputial space.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> This process
      is completed by age 3 in 90% of boys, but it may take as long
      as 17 years for some boys to have a fully retractable
      foreskin.</p>

      <p>At birth, the separation of the foreskin from the glans
      has just begun. The newborn's penis is, of course, not yet
      fully developed. Not only does circumcision interfere with
      its development, but it re quires that the surgeon tear the
      skin from the sensitive glans to permit removal. Perhaps as a
      way to avoid confronting this reality, physicians refer to
      this as "breaking adhesions."</p>

      <p><b>Function</b></p>

      <p>If physicians would simply leave the newborn's penis
      intact, as Dr Spock came to recommend,<sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> the foreskin would be left to fulfil
      its several functions. In infancy, the foreskin protects the
      glans from irritation and from fecal material. The function
      of the foreskin in adulthood may at first seem more obscure.
      The shaft and usually the glans of an uncircumcised man's
      penis are covered by skin. Retracting the foreskin reveals
      the glans and makes the skin on the shaft somewhat loose. Of
      what use is this redundant skin? During erection, the penile
      shaft elongates, becoming about 50% longer. The foreskin
      covers this lengthened shaft and is thus specifically
      designed to accommodate an organ that is capable of a marked
      increase in diameter and length.</p>

      <p>In addition, the foreskin is one of the most sensitive
      parts of the penis and can enhance the quality of sexual
      intercourse. Anatomical studies demonstrate that the foreskin
      has a greater concentration of complex nerve endings than the
      glans.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> If there is any
      possibility that the foreskin can contribute significantly to
      sexual enjoyment, is that not a cogent reason for rethinking
      our motives for this ritual procedure?</p>

      <p><b>The Case Against Circumcision:</b></p>

      <p>History shows that the arguments in favor of circumcision
      are questionable. At the beginning of this century, one of
      the reasons given for circumcision was to decrease
      masturbation, which was thought to lead to insanity and other
      "morbid" conditions. We now know that circumcision does not
      prevent masturbation, nor does masturbation lead to
      insanity.</p>

      <p>More recently, circumcision was promoted as a means of
      preventing cervical cancer in the man's sexual partners; this
      notion has been proved incorrect.<sup><a
      href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p>The current excuses are that failure to remove the
      foreskin may contribute to urinary tract infections and
      penile cancer, but neither of these contentions has been
      proved. Performing 100 mutilative surgeries to possibly
      prevent one treatable urinary tract infection is not valid
      preventive medicine-it is just another excuse. Penile cancer
      occurs in older men at a rate of approximately 1 per 100,000.
      <span class="CIRP">[CIRP note: This is an annualized rate
      based on the lifetime risk of contracting penile
      cancer.]</span> The idea of performing 100,000 mutilating
      procedures on newborns to possibly prevent cancer in one
      elderly man is absurd. Applying this type of reasoning to
      women would seem to lead to the conclusion that breast cancer
      should be prevented by removing the breasts at puberty.</p>

         <font size="4">"Not only does circumcision<br />
         interfere will penile<br />
         development, but it requires<br />
         that the surgeon tear the skin<br />
         from the sensitive glans to<br />
         permit removal."</font><br />
         ---------------------------------------<br />

      <p>One thousand years ago, the Jewish sage Maimonides said
      that the effect of circumcision was "to limit sexual
      intercourse, and to weaken the organ of generation as far as
      possible, and thus cause man to be moderate...for there is no
      doubt that circumcision weakens the power of sexual
      excitement, and sometimes lessens the natural enjoyment; the
      organ necessarily becomes weak when ... deprived of its
      covering from the beginning. Our sages say distinctly: it is
      hard for a woman, with whom an uncircumcised [man] had sexual
      intercourse, to separate from him.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p>Infants are routinely circumcised without anesthesia. In
      the past few years, scientific papers have demonstrated that
      infants' responses to pain are similar to those of adults,
      indicating that babies do indeed experience pain.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> This is supported by the fact that the
      quality of an infant's cry is appallingly different at
      circumcision.</p>

      <div align="center">
        ----------------------------------------<br />
         <font size="4">"To me, the idea of performing<br />
         100,000 mutilative procedures<br />
         on newborns to possibly<br />
         prevent cancer in one elderly<br />
         man is absurd."</font><br />
         -----------------------------------------<br />

      <p>Who has the right to order or perform such surgery on a
      newborn infant? I contend that no one does, not even a
      physician or the parent, especially as there is no proven
      medical reason to do so, and the procedure may even be
      harmful. It can always be performed in adulthood for men who
      desire it, with fully informed consent.</p>

      <p>I believe that physicians who continue to perform routine
      circumcision are not only harming infants but are also
      harming the integrity of the medical profession. It is hard
      to accept that these physicians, most of whom have been
      circumcised themselves are using their medical licenses to
      mutilate others. This is tragedy perpetuating itself.</p>
