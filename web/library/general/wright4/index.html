      <h2>NON-THERAPEUTIC CIRCUMCISION</h2>

      <p class="author"><b>J. E. W<span class="sc1">RIGHT</span>,
      F.R.A.C.S.<br />
       <i>Royal Newcastle Hospital, Newcastle, N.S.W.</i></b></p>

      <p class="text2">I<span class="sc2">N</span> 1949 Gairdner
      drew attention to the fact that circumcision is one of the
      commonest operations performed, yet it is "accorded the least
      critical consideration." In our community, circumcision of
      the newborn male is frequently requested or demanded as a
      right by the parents, and just as often is performed after a
      minimum of medical thought as to the need for it, or its
      effects.</p>

      <p class="text2">In the writer's view, the design and
      behaviour of the prepuce is as skillfully adapted to the
      needs of the newborn infant male as any other part of his
      anatomy. <span class="yellow">Removal of it may be to his
      detriment.</span></p>

      <h5>THE FUNCTION OF THE PREPUCE</h5>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">The prepuce has an
      essentially protective role.</span> It is no accident that
      the prepuce is not normally retractible until the age of
      three, four or five years. By this time the child no longer
      wears napkins, and the danger of injury from friction or
      chemical or bacterial irritants is much less.</p>

      <p class="text2">Figure 1 illustrates an example of the
      protective function of the foreskin. This boy had suffered
      second degree burns to the pubis, thighs and genitalia. The
      prepuce was involved and swelled considerably, but throughout
      the boy's treatment and convalescence he voided normally,
      with no evidence of dysuria. Had he been circumcised, the
      glans would almost certainly have suffered injury with
      subsequent scarring, and meatal stenosis might well have
      resulted.</p>

        height="332" />
      </center>

      <h5>THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE FORESKIN</h5>

      <p class="text2">The development of the prepuce is not
      complete at birth, and at this time the foreskin is rarely
      retractible. This non-retractibility must not be taken as an
      indication for circumcision. In fact, it is hard to imagine a
      medical indication for circumcision at this age. By simple
      but incomplete withdrawal of the prepuce it can nearly always
      be demonstrated that the meatal opening is larger than the
      urinary meatus.</p>

      <h5>TRUE MEDICAL INDICATIONS FOR AND CONTRA-INDICATIONS TO
      CIRCUMCISION.</h5>

      <h5>Phimosis</h5>

      <p class="text2">True phimosis is not common. Hospital
      reports are confused, as the term is used loosely to justify
      "social" circumcision, and description of the actual
      pathological finding is often conspicuous by its absence. To
      diagnose phimosis, one must find not only a non-retractile
      foreskin, but a small preputial opening. "Ballooning" of the
      prepuce occurs on micturition.</p>

      <h5>Paraphimosis</h5>

      <p class="text2">Paraphimosis, too, is rare in young
      children. It is doubtful if one episode constitutes an
      indication for circumcision. Rater does it emphasize the
      necessity for education of the parents. Clinic sisters often
      advise mothers of uncircumcised boys to retract the prepuce
      during bathing. It has already been pointed out that this is
      unphysiological under the age of three to five years, and
      should be discouraged. When the prepuce is freely retractable
      it is legitimate and perhaps advisable to retract it in the
      bath provided that the parent ensure that it is reduced again
      to its previous state. <span class="yellow">Surgery is no
      substitute for education of the public in normal anatomy and
      physiology.</span></p>

      <h5>Chronic or Recurrent Balanoposthitis</h5>

      <p class="text2">Recurrent infection under a non-retractable
      foreskin in an older child (it is rarely seen in the infant)
      seems a more legitimate reason for recommending operation to
      allow drainage. In the acute stage, if operation is necessary
      after failed conservative measures, the performance of a
      preliminary dorsal slit may be a safer procedure. The
      fortunate rarity of this condition in infants is possibly the
      result of the persisting attachment of the prepuce to the
      glans. It occurs more commonly in elderly diabetics.</p>

      <h5>Posthitis-a Contraindication</h5>

      <p class="text2">Inflammation of the prepuce, often
      participating in a generalized skin infection of the nappy
      area, is occasionally cited as an indication for
      circumcision. <span class="yellow">The writer is emphatic
      that it is an absolute contraindication to the
      operation</span>, as it exposes the glans and meatus to the
      same pathological process. Other contraindications such as
      h&aelig;mophilia and hypospadias are well known.</p>

      <h5>METHODS OF CIRCUMCISION</h5>

      <p class="text2">No method of circumcision is perfect. In
      adults and older children, the standard cut, ligature and
      suture method is most commonly used and is quite
      satisfactory. For neonates, many quicker methods have been
      devised. The bone forceps technique is effective, yet
      occasionally the glans and urinary meatus are damaged, with
      disastrous consequences. Personal experiences with the clamp
      method ("Gumco" or "Little Trimmer") have been
      unsatisfactory. These clamps are designed to offset the
      danger of the bone forceps while still retaining the
      advantage of speed. In a significant proportion of cases
      h&aelig;mostasis is incomplete, and recourse must be had to
      ligature and suture.</p>

      <p class="text2">The newer "Plastibell" technique, originally
      designed for circumcising the baby at birth, has much to
      recommend it (as a method) for the neonate. It is quick and
      relatively safe compared with other methods. The prepuce is
      separated from the glans after a small preliminary dorsal
      slit has been made, and the "Plastibell" is inserted over the
      glans under the prepuce, which is then tied with tightly
      round it at the base with a thread. The prepuce beyond the
      thread is then excised, and the "Plastibell" remaining <i>in
      situ</i> as a h&aelig;mostatic agent. The baby may be bathed
      normally (and should be to keep the penis and attached
      foreign body clean), and the "bell" and thread fall off on
      the fifth or sixth post-operative day. There is a foreign
      body reaction with mild redness and swelling, but the
      ultimate result is good. The advantages are speed, relative
      safety from bleeding (see below), no bathing restrictions and
      a good result.</p>

      <h5>COMPLICATIONS OF CIRCUMCISION</h5>

      <p class="text2">The immediate complications are bleeding,
      infection and damage to the glans. <span class="yellow">Death
      can result from the first two, or indirectly from
      anaesthesia.</span> The remote complications are those which
      result from the removal of the nature-given protective action
      of the prepuce, namely, meatal ulcer and stenosis.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="wright4-tab1.gif" alt="Table one" width="500"
        height="306" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Death is fortunately rare, yet it does
      occur. In Australia there was a death in 1963 and one in 1964
      from circumcision (Table 1). In England and Wales, from 1960
      till 1964 inclusive, there were six such deaths of infants
      and children.</p>

      <p class="text2">Bleeding is occasionally a source of worry,
      and anyone confronted with it cannot help regretting that he
      agreed to circumcise the child because the parents demanded
      it.</p>

      <p class="text2">Infection in rare. The wound always looks
      superficially infected, but clinical evidence of bacterial
      invasion is not often seen.</p>

      <h5>RECENT PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH CIRCUMCISION, 1963 TO
      1966</h5>

      <p class="text2">From March, 1963, till January, 1966, the
      writer performed, or was responsible for the performance of
      822 circumcisions of infants and children. The records of
      those have been reviewed, and those of all patients admitted
      to the <a
      href="http://www.hunter.health.nsw.gov.au/servs_facil/rnh.htm"
       target="_blank">Royal Newcastle Hospital</a>, during the
      same period of time, suffering from complications of
      circumcision or the consequences of not being circumcised,
      were also studied.</p>

      <p class="text2">Details of the 822 circumcisions are shown
      in Table 2. Seven hundred and eighty-eight of these were
      non-therapeutic neonatal circumcisions. Twenty-one were
      non-therapeutic procedures in older children and only 13 were
      medically indicated.</p>

      <h5>Neonatal Circumcisions</h5>

      <p class="text2">Neonatal circumcisions were all performed or
      attempted with the use of the "Plastibell" technique. Three
      types of early complications were seen. The immediate one was
      bleeding at the time of the operation. This may be the result
      of the following occurrences.</p>

      <p class="text2">1. The ligature not being tied tightly
      enough.</p>

      <p class="text2">2. The initial dorsal slit (preputiotomy)
      being carried too far towards the corona, allowing the apex
      of the incision in the inner layer to retract behind the
      ligature. This results in a shaft h&aelig;matoma.</p>

      <p class="text2">3. Injury to the frenulum while separating
      the adherent foreskin.</p>
      It was found that the only way to control such bleeding was
      to remove the "Plastibell" and resort to the ligature and
      suture method.<br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="text2">Retained "Plastibell" was the commonest
      complication. Instead of falling off the fifth or sixth day,
      the rim was still <i>in situ</i> when the baby was brought
      back for review after a week. Removal was quite easy and
      posed no problems.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="wright4-tab2.gif" alt="Table two" width="500"
        height="321" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">Infection as such was not seen. A
      foreign-body reaction was often mistaken for infection by
      resident medical officers, but always settled on removal of
      the "Plastibell."</p>

      <p class="text2">From March, 1964, till January, 1966,
      accurate records of these complications were kept as a
      prospective study. The incidence of primary bleeding was 2%
      (8 cases) and of retained "Plastibell" 11% (41 cases).</p>

      <h5>Non-Therapeutic Circumcision of Older Infants and
      Children</h5>

      <p class="text2">Twenty-one boys were circumcised by the cut,
      ligature and suture technique under general an&aelig;sthesia.
      These circumcisions were all carried out because of parental
      demand. Attempts were made to persuade such parents of
      infants beyond the neonatal period to wait till they were
      aged one year before having the operation done. When the
      infants are aged over six to eight weeks general
      an&aelig;sthesia is necessary. There were no serious
      immediate complications in this group. (It must be emphasized
      that the views expressed above, based on this series and
      previous experience, have caused this writer to discontinue
      the policy of consenting to perform circumcisions on parental
      demand only, without a medical indication.</p>

      <h5>Therapeutic Circumcision</h5>

      <p class="text2">Details of the 13 boys circumcised for
      medical reasons are given in Table 3. Five circumcisions were
      performed for true phimosis. It may well be argued that if it
      had not been for the large number of prophylactic operations
      the number of therapeutic procedures needed would have
      multiplied many times. Yet it is hard to believe that it
      would have approached 700.</p>

      <h5>MEATAL STENOSIS</h5>

      <p class="text2"><span class="yellow">Meatal stenosis is the
      all-important late complication of circumcision.</span>
      During the period under review (March 1963, till January,
      1966), 28 boys were seen at the Royal Newcastle Hospital by
      the writer and other surgeons with meatal stenosis
      sufficiently severe to require meatotomy. Four others were
      admitted to hospital because of meatal ulceration which did
      not progress to stenosis.</p>

      <p class="text2">Meatotomy is a simple procedure, but it does
      require a general an&aelig;sthetic. The children presented
      with dyuria (screaming on mictirition) because of ulceration
      and crusting over the meatus, frequency of micturition caused
      by the tiny opening or, in one case enuresis. All were cured
      by meatotomy. Their ages varied from one to nine years. It
      must be emphasized that these 28 cases were not drawn
      entirely from the series discussed above. The occurrence of
      the condition is not related to the method of circumcision or
      the skill with which it is performed., for it is a late
      complication. It is simply the consequence of the loss of
      protective foreskin.</p>

      <center>
        <img src="wright4-tab3.gif" alt="Table three" width="500"
        height="301" />
      </center>

      <p class="text2">This common complication of circumcision,
      requiring further surgery, provides one of the strongest
      arguments against routine removal of the prepuce. It is
      certainly indicates the fallacy of the argument that boys
      should be circumcised so they will have "no trouble in later
      life."</p>

      <h5>COMPLICATIONS OF BEING UNCIRCUMCISED</h5>

      <p class="text2">To present both sides of the picture, one
      must refer to other patients who required admission to
      hospital, during the same period, because of bona-fide
      complications of still being in possession of a foreskin. The
      following remarks apply to all patient admitted to the <a
      href="http://www.hunter.health.nsw.gov.au/servs_facil/rnh.htm"
       target="_blank">Royal Newcastle Hospital</a> between March,
      1963, and January, 1966, and not only to the writer's
      cases.</p>

      <h5>Paraphimosis</h5>

      <p class="text2">There were seven patients admitted to
      hospital with paraphimosis during this period. Their ages
      ranged from four to 47 years; three were children, two
      adolescents and two adults. Two were treated by simple
      reduction of the prepuce; the others needed reduction of the
      prepuce and circumcision.</p>

      <h5>Phimosis</h5>

      <p class="text2">Five of the writer's cases of phimosis have
      been mentioned above. In addition there were several children
      with phimosis who were circumcised by other surgeons, and 11
      adults who were similarly treated.</p>

      <h5>Balanoposthitis</h5>

      <p class="text2">There were six adults with recurrent or
      chronic balanoposthitis who required circumcision. Four of
      these were diabetics.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP commment: Dr. Wright next turns to
      discussion of cancer of the penis and cervix. His discussion
      represents the medical beliefs of the time (1967). However,
      later discoveries show that this information is mostly
      incorrect. We now know that the principal risk factors for
      cancer of the penis and cancer of the cervix are 1) infection
      with the human papilloma virus and 2) use of tobacco. Lack of
      circumcision is not viewed as a risk factor today. For more
      information visit <a href="/library/disease/cancer/">Penile
      Cancer, Cervical Cancer and Circumcision</a>.]</p>

      <h5>CIRCUMCISION AND CARCINOMA OF THE PENIS</h5>

      <p class="text2">There is not doubt that early circumcision
      prevents the development of carcinoma of the penis. The
      carcinogenic properties of smegma are implicated as the
      causal agent. Sampson Handley (1936) advocated routine
      "preputiotomy" (the making of a dorsal slit) for neonatal
      boys as a prophylaxis against this neoplasm. Were carcinoma
      of the penis as common as lung cancer, preputiotomy or
      routine circumcision would be justified to prevent it. Table
      1 gives the death rate in Australia (1960 to 1964 inclusive)
      from penile cancer and non-therapeutic circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">During the period March, 1963, till January,
      1965, only three patients were admitted to the Royal
      Newcastle Hospital with penile carcinoma, and only one of
      these was a "new case."</p>

      <p class="text2">If circumcision were entirely without
      complication and disadvantages, its use as a prophylactic
      measure would be justified, even with a low incidence of
      penile cancer. Yet it is not. Nor is it clear whether
      carcinoma of the penis is prevented by adequate personal
      hygiene in the uncircumcised. This may well be a safer means
      of prophylaxis.</p>

      <h5>CIRCUMCISION AND CARCINOMA OF THE UTERINE CERVIX</h5>

      <p class="text2">Sampson Handley (1936) drew attention to a
      possible link between the incidence of carcinoma of the
      uterine cervix and the incidence of circumcision in the male
      sexual partners. He pointed out that Jewesses infrequently
      suffer from the condition. In Fiji, fewer cases of carcinoma
      were seen among Fijian women than among immigrant Indian
      women. Fijian males are circumcised at puberty, while Indian
      males remain uncircumcised. Many subsequent papers have
      written on the subject, but the evidence is slender. Wynder
      <i>et alii</i> (1964) conducted a controlled study, and found
      that "between five and eight per cent of the white non-Jewish
      cervical cancer population were effectively exposed only to
      circumcised males, while the comparable figure for the
      controls were between 14 and 18 per centum." Janes <i>et
      alii</i> (1958) however, in an extensive study of the
      epidemiological factors involved in carcinoma of the cervix,
      also matched control subjects and cancer patients, and
      concluded that "circumcision, or lack of circumcision, was as
      frequent in partners of cases with cancer as in cases of
      controls."</p>

      <p class="text2">There seems little doubt that human smegma
      is carcinogenic (Heins <i>et alii</i>, 1958; Pratt-Thomas
      <i>et alii</i>, 1956). If indeed, it is true that the wife of
      an uncircumcised male is subject to a slightly greater risk
      of developing cervical carcinoma because of smegma under the
      prepuce, it may be that adequate male hygiene would protect
      her as much as circumcision of her husband. Carcinoma of the
      cervix is more common amongst the poorer classes (Jones et
      alii, 1958), and it is reasonable to assume that their
      standard of personal hygiene may be lower than that of others
      more fortunate.</p>

      <h5>DISCUSSION</h5>

      <p class="text2">Though the risks of circumcision are not
      great, they must be weighed against the very dubious
      benefits. The procedure is performed as a social custom
      rather than a form of medical prophylaxis. <span
      class="yellow">So real are the disadvantages ensuing from
      loss of the foreskin that the writer is firmly of the opinion
      that non-therapeutic circumcision should no longer be
      performed.</span></p>

      <p class="text2">Certainly, these views have been expressed
      many times, yet the normal anatomy, physiology and protective
      function of the foreskin are still understood poorly by
      recent medical graduates, and by the public not at all.
      Accordingly, this paper has been written in the hope of
      stimulating a continuing interest in the subject. If some
      thought and argument is provoked, however little in agreement
      with the writer's views, the paper will have achieved its
      purpose.</p>

      <h5>SUMMARY</h5>

      <p class="text2">The foreskin has a definite
      purpose&mdash;protection of the urinary meatus and the
      incompletely developed glans penis. A non-retractable
      foreskin in the neonate and infant is normal, for the process
      of separation from the glans is incomplete at birth.</p>

      <p class="text2">The untoward consequences of the operation
      are those resulting from the loss of protective functions of
      the foreskin-meatal ulceration and stenosis. The operation
      itself has a slight but very real danger.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision is effective in preventing
      phimosis, paraphimosis and penile carcinoma, but the view is
      expressed that the balance of risks argues against the
      practice of non-therapeutic circumcision as a routine
      prophylactic measure. The ultimate decision must be based on
      more adequate evidence of the incidence of complications of
      being uncircumcised; it is a decision to be made by the
      medical profession rather than by the dictates of social
      demand.</p>
