    <h3>Letters to the editor</h3>

    <p>Sir,</p>

    <p>Routine neonatal circumcision has been a matter of
    controversy in the United States during the last decade,
    reflected by the fact that not even the Task Force on
    Circumcision was able to give definite recommendations but
    concluded that "circumcision has advantages as well as
    disadvantages". Dr. Schoen, being the chairman of the Task
    Force, has recently presented a broad survey in the New England
    Journal of Medicine, advocating general and unanaesthetized
    circumcision of newborns(1). However in the same issue of NEJM
    another member of the task force, took an opposite view, i.e.
    circumcision is unwarranted (2). Asked by the editors of Acta
    Paediatrica we want to make the following comments to Dr.
    Schoen's letter.</p>

    <p>We think that the discussion of routine neonatal
    circumcision should focus on the prevention of childhood
    diseases. With regard to prevention of diseases in adult men,
    it is in our opinion more fair to postpone a decision till the
    young man may make a choice of his own.</p>

    <p>Balanoposthitis is reduced in circumcised small boys, but
    even a proportion of circumcised boys have penile problems.(3)
    The pyelonephritis preventing effect of neonatal circumcision,
    explained by the decrease in periurethral colonization with
    potentially uropathogenic bacteria seems well documented (4,5).
    However, we think that circumcision is an unphysiologic way to
    solve this problem and we have recently discussed these aspects
    (6). It is unprecedented in medical history that a common and
    potentially lethal disease can be prevented by extirpation of a
    piece of healthy tissue of universal occurrence in males. we
    suggested that the effects of one unphysiological intervention,
    e.g. circumcision counterbalance those of another, e.g.
    colonization of the baby's gastrointestinal tract and genitals
    in maternity units by Escherichia coli strains of non-maternal
    origin, to which the baby has no passive immunity. We suggest
    that aspects of preputial bacterial colonization should be
    better studied before advice is given about the routine
    circumcision.</p>

    <p>The situation is different in babies at high risk for
    infections and severe renal damage, e.g. those with urethral
    valves or uterocele where the obstructions should be eliminated
    immediately, or with grade IV-V vesicouteric reflux, especially
    when associated with intrarenal reflux. These conditions are
    now often diagnosed immediately postnatally as a consequence of
    antenatal sound examinations. In this selected group of
    patients preputial colonization might constitute a seizable
    [sic] risk, where extirpation of the prepuce breaks an
    important link in the chain of events leading to UTI. We feel
    that circumcision in these instances should be considered as an
    alternative to long-term antibiotic prophylaxis.</p>

    <p>There are also two ethical aspects which should be
    considered before routine circumcision is recommended. Firstly,
    it it justifiable to operate on 100 babies to prevent infection
    in one, or to operate on 1 000 babies to prevent renal scarring
    in one or two (assuming that 1/5 or 1/10 of those infected will
    attract a scar)? Secondly, when mass circumcision in applied,
    caution or even reluctance against anaesthesia is advocated -
    the risks (and costs?) would be too high(1). In the debate on
    circumcision in NEJM, provoked by the papers by Dr. Schoen and
    Dr. Poland, it was pointed out that an Ethics Committee on
    Experimental Animals would not accept a procedure such as
    circumcision on laboratory animals without adequate
    anaesthesia[9]. If circumcision is used in only a few selected
    cases, as suggested above, appropriate pain relief can be
    given. Thus the human rights not to be subjected to unnecessary
    pain will be recognized and defended also in the newborn, who
    as a matter of a fact reacts more intensely to painful stimuli
    than other age groups do (7,8).</p>
