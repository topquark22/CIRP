      <h1>THE RAPE OF THE PHALLUS</h1>

      <p class="navlink"><b>William Keith C. Morgan, MD</b></p>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p>Surgical operations fall into three types. First, there
      are those which are socially acceptable and which can be
      discussed in public without embarrassment; second, there are
      those which do not qualify as conversation pieces and
      generally are mentioned only in whispers; and last, there are
      those which are actually thought to add to the social status
      of the incised subject. Those in the latter category pass
      rapidly in and out of favor. While nephroplexy was in vogue
      30 years ago, 10 to 15 years later tonsillectomy was popular,
      and currently such exotic operations as hiatus hernia repair
      are the real status symbols. Before an operation can be
      accepted as likely to add to one's social status, certain
      criteria have to be fulfilled: the operation must be
      performed on a U part of the body, preferably the symptoms
      which it aims to relieve should be vague and supratentorial
      in origin, and last, but of paramount importance, there
      should be no valid medical reason for it. (U denotes upper
      and refers to figures of speech and terms appropriate to, and
      used by the upper class. Non-U is the reverse and implies
      lack of social acceptability. Thus, "looking glass" is U
      while "mirror" is definitely non-U.<sup>1</sup>)</p>

      <p>Routine circumcision completely fills the second and third
      criteria but whether the operation site is to be classified
      as U or non-U has not yet been decided by Alan Ross or Nancy
      Mitford. This ritual, however, has become so widespread in
      the United States that it is no longer much of a status
      symbol, and a situation has arisen where any recently
      delivered mother who is eccentric enough to wish her child to
      retain his prepuce, would be well advised to maintain
      permanent guard over it until such time as they both leave
      the hospital. The nursery staff of most American hospitals
      have an insatiable urge to remove the foreskin and this
      instinct often causes great concern among European women who
      do not subscribe to this practice and through force of
      circumstances have their baby in the United States.</p>

      <p>Why is the operation of circumcision practiced? One might
      as well attempt to explain the rites of voodoo! Ritual is
      seldom self- explanatory and still less frequently logical.
      Nevertheless, at least two origins of circumcision can be
      traced. First, it is part of an ancient rite practiced by
      many primitive tribes whereby the young male and less
      frequently the young female, gives proof of his or her
      ability to endure pain. If they pass the test with fortitude,
      they are then accepted into the tribe as fully developed
      adults with attendant privileges. Thus in this respect the
      operation is similar to many of the tattoos and scars
      produced by burning, piercing or incising that are accepted
      as routine cosmetic procedures by these peoples. Second, in
      many primitive African tribes circumcision is performed to
      reduce libido. This mutilating practice is generally
      performed on women to keep them faithful to their husbands.
      Male infant circumcision is practiced by all Semitic races,
      Jew and Arab alike, and has been exported by them to all
      parts of the world and to most races. It will perhaps be a
      cause of surprise to those of Semitic origin to find that the
      Australian aborigine has practiced circumcision for as long,
      if not longer, and for the same basic reason as his more
      civilized brethren.</p>

      <p>So much for the origin of circumcision. Why does the
      operation find so much favor in Western society? There are a
      variety of reasons advanced in favor of circumcision most of
      which are unconvincing when critically examined. Let us
      consider the so-called medical (or surgical) reasons first.
      Those few pediatricians who have practiced in an unmutilated
      population agree that phimosis is all but unknown in infancy.
      The prepuce is not retractile at birth and does not become so
      until the child is between two and three years old. A
      non-retractile foreskin is not synonymous with phimosis and
      should not be used as pretext for lopping off an innocent and
      useful appendage. It has been claimed that the uncircumcised
      male is more prone to venereal disease. Any US or British
      physician with experience in North Africa or the Levant knows
      that the Middle East has a venereal disease rate which is
      second to none. Foreign aid in this context is superfluous.
      The argument is also advanced, this time with much greater
      justification, that cancer of the penis is found almost
      entirely in the uncircumcised; nevertheless, this is an
      uncommon form of cancer and generally has a fairly good
      prognosis. Appendicitis causes many more deaths than does
      cancer of the penis but nobody yet recommends routine
      appendectomy. Perhaps the most fatuous reason advanced for
      the operation is that the uncircumcised penis is less
      hygienic. Soap and water work wonders with the body's other
      orifices and appendages and there would seem no reason to
      doubt their efficacy with respect to the foreskin. The pinnae
      also collect dirt but removal of the external ears does not
      find favor as a routine measure of hygiene. A further
      important indication for circumcision which is seldom
      mentioned in the surgical textbooks is chronic remunerative
      balanitis.</p>

      <p>How is it that parents accept this procedure with such
      equanimity and enthusiasm? This can be attributed in part to
      pressure exerted by their medical adviser and in part due to
      the fact that the procedure has become customary - one has to
      lop it off along with the Joneses. Moreover, many mothers
      will express the opinion that the circumcised phallus is more
      aesthetic, but in general their experience of the
      uncircumcised organ is limited to memories of a Michelangelo
      sculpture which appeared as an illustration in one of their
      college textbooks. Perhaps not least of the reasons why
      American mothers seem to endorse the operation with such
      enthusiasm is the fact that it is one way an intensely
      matriarchal society can permanently influence the physical
      characteristics of its males.</p>

      <p>So far the reasons usually given for routine circumcision
      in infants have been examined and found wanting. Now let us
      consider whether the operation is in any way harmful or
      contraindicated. The function of the prepuce is to protect
      the glans, the latter being almost insensitive to most
      ordinary tactile and thermal stimuli. It has, however,
      specific receptors for other pleasurable sensations. Removal
      of the prepuce exposes the glans to foreign stimuli which
      dull these special receptors. During the act of coitus the
      uncircumcised phallus penetrates smoothly and without
      friction, the prepuce gradually retracting as the organ
      advances. In contrast, when the circumcised organ is
      introduced during coitus, friction develops between the glans
      and vaginal mucosa. Penetration in the circumcised man has
      been compared to thrusting the foot into a sock held open at
      the top, while, on the other hand, in the intact counterpart
      it has been likened to slipping the foot into a sock that has
      been previously rolled up. The comparison is apt and worthy
      of Osler in one of his Rabelaisian moments.</p>

      <p>This commentary must not be construed as a crusade against
      circumcision. The teaching of the Koran and the Bible, the
      mistaken beliefs of many of the medical profession, the
      intuition of woman, and, above all, folklore, tradition, and
      health insurance agencies support this ritual. Nevertheless,
      let us remember that 98 times out of 100 there is no valid
      indication for this mutilation other than religion.</p>
