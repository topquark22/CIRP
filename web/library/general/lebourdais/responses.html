    <h2>ANTI-CIRCUMCISION GROUPS CRITICIZED</h2>
    <br />
    <br />

    <div class="corpus">
      <h3>Letters to the Editor: Canadian Medical Association
      Journal. 153(7):885-6, 1995 Oct 1.</h3>

      <p class="text2">The article "<a
      href="/library/general/lebourdais/">Circumcision no longer a
      `routine' surgical procedure</a>" (<i>Can Med Assoc J</i>
      1995, 152: 1873-1876), by Eleanor LeBourdais prompts me to
      write. I cannot help but see attacks on traditional Jewish
      circumcision as little more than thinly disguised
      anti-Semitism. I am hard-pressed to find any Jewish men who
      feel chat the "mutilation" they supposedly suffered as 8
      day-old baby has affected their later sexual fulfilment or
      emotional and psychic well-being.</p>

      <p class="text2">Interest groups such as RECover A Penis
      (RECAP) and End the Horror of Infant Circumcision (ETHIC)
      should poll a sample of Jewish men to establish the extent of
      the damage suffered as a result of their involuntary
      circumcision as infants. I have spent 39 years in the company
      of Jewish men, and I have never heard a single complaint or
      regret about the loss of a foreskin from a fellow Jew. I am
      rather proud of my foreskinless penis -- I see it as a badge
      of honour, setting me apart from those whose traditions do
      not demand its removal.</p>

      <p class="text2">The presence or absence of medical
      indications for circumcision is irrelevant to my decision
      that my sons would also be circumcised, the Mosaic law,
      prescribed 57 centuries age, is sufficient justification.
      Regardless of the hysteria whipped up by interest groups that
      try to convince me of the psychic harm caused by neonatal
      circumcision, I have no intention of violating a tradition
      that uniquely symbolizes the enduring covenant between Jew
      and God. If you were to ask me whether I would violate the
      law to maintain this tradition my answer would be an
      unequivocal Yes.</p>

      <p class="text2">I applaud the colleges of physicians clans
      and surgeons of British Columbia and Ontario, which have
      resisted the demands of anti-circumcision groups that
      circumcision be prohibited. Members of these colleges who
      perform ritual neonatal male circumcision would be justified
      in seeing a proscription on circumcision as en infringement
      of their religious freedom.</p>

      <p class="text2">Members of anti-circumcision groups who
      claim that they are harmed by their lack of a foreskin are
      welcome to restore the missing bit by any means deemed
      appropriate. I welcome correspondence to CMAJ from all those
      intent on preserving the Mosaic tradition in the face of the
      latest onslaught.</p>

      <p>Robin Chorn, BSc, MBChB, FRCPC<br />
       Chicago, Ill.</p>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p class="text2">Eleanor LeBourdais' article is a regrettable
      attempt to attack the performance of neonatal circumcision,
      but it is CMAJ that should be taken to task for printing it.
      It is unconscionable that this article can now influence
      physicians' viewpoints and advice to patients.</p>

      <p class="text2">LeBourdais states that "Few people classify
      themselves as 'pro-circumcision,'" yet she also states that
      those opposed to circumcision meet resistance when they try
      to abolish the procedure. From her own data, she found that
      at 40% of male infants in British Columbia were circumcised
      last year. Thus, unquestionably 40% of new parents are
      strongly pro-circumcision, as their actions readily show.</p>

      <p class="text2">These courageous parents maintain their
      stance despite the prejudice against the procedure in the BC
      health care system. Many patients have remarked on the great
      lengths to which they had to go, against the advice of nurses
      and to obtain circumcision for their infant sons. Others who
      wished to obtain the procedure have simply given up. Is the
      present bias against routine circumcision justified?</p>

      <p class="text2">The information LeBourdais presents on
      cancer of the penis only emphasizes her wish to abolish the
      procedure without regard for the facts. Squamous cell
      carcinoma of the penis occurs only among uncircumcised men,
      and neonatal circumcision is effective prophylaxis. Had
      LeBourdais pointed out that this type of cancer is rare, or
      that regular hygiene by uncircumcised men (as taught and
      practiced in Scandinavia) will probably also prevent it, she
      would have provided more reasonable support for her
      position.</p>

      <p class="text2">If LeBourdais were to write objectively, she
      would also have mentioned that acquiring sexually transmitted
      diseases, including HIV infection, is significantly more
      likely among those with foreskins than among those without.
      This has been documented in many epidemiologic studies. Any
      balanced discussion of the procedure must include the
      information that circumcision provides some protection
      against potentially fatal contagious diseases.</p>

      <p class="text2">As a practicing dermatologist with expertise
      in cutaneous disorders of the penis, I regularly see men who
      arc suffering from recurrent balanoposthitis, a condition
      prevented by neonatal circumcision. Other cutaneous disorders
      such as lichen sclerosus (balanitis xerotica obliterans),
      which can cause cancer, or plasma cell balanitis of Zoon,
      which is benign but troublesome, are found only among those
      who are uncircumcised. All too often circumcision is required
      to cure these diseases: however, the chance of morbidity from
      the procedure cure is much higher among adults than among
      infants. Many patients have expressed regret that they were
      not circumcised. early in life. If the costs of care
      throughout their lives for uncircumcised men were correctly
      calculated, we might well find that neonatal male
      circumcision is indeed cost-effective.</p>

      <p class="text2">LeBourdais' most objectionable tactic is to
      suggest that those responsible and caring physicians who
      continue to perform neonatal circumcision my face criminal
      charges. This is a not-very-subtle attempt to frighten
      physicians and prevent access to circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">The journal of our national medical
      association should acknowledge that there was no
      justification for publishing this abysmal article in the
      guise of accurate and objective analysis.</p>

      <p>Brian W. Gregory, BSc, MD, FRCPC<br />
       Vancouver, BC</p>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p><b>The author responds:</b></p>

      <p class="text2">Dr. Gregory is to his opinion on the value
      and benefits of circumcision. He should realize, however,
      that a significant number of Canadians do not share his
      views, and his objections would be more appropriately
      directed at such organizations as <a
      href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/" target="_blank">Health
      Canada</a>, which has stated that "there appear to be no
      medical reasons for circumcision of an infant," or the <a
      href="http://www.cps.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian Paediatric
      Society</a>, which has said that a "careful review of the
      potential benefits (including the reported decrease in
      urinary tract infection) and the complications of
      circumcision does not support this as a routine
      procedure."</p>

      <p class="text2">I did not dwell on the benefits or drawbacks
      of circumcision, since these have been debated extensively
      elsewhere. Rather, my intent was to review historical and
      cultural reasons for the performance of circumcision and the
      possible effect of new legislation and changing Western
      perceptions of children's rights.</p>

      <p class="text2">In Canada, we are seeing increasing
      instances of young adults seeking legal restitution fur
      procedures or actions performed without consent when they
      were children. An example is the recent court award to an
      Alberta woman who was sterilized at age 14 with goverment
      sanction.</p>

      <p class="text2">Adolescents are now empowered to consent to
      or refuse such procedures as abortion and blood transfusion.
      Gregory may not like the idea but, as I stated in my article,
      the <a
      href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/annex_e.html#I"
      target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a>,
      the United Nations <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">Convention on the
      Rights of the Child</a> and British Columbia <a
      href="http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/I/96223_01.htm"
      target="_blank">Infants Act</a> all contain provisions thee
      could be used in a court action or a human-rights <a
      href="http://www.courtchallenge.com/"
      target="_blank">challenge</a>. As an adult, it is for each
      man to decide whether circumcision is beneficial or harmful
      for him. It is, therefore, possible that a man circumcised
      infancy could later conclude there were no acceptable reasons
      for subjecting him to such a painful experience and that his
      rights were violated.</p>

      <p class="text2">I am puzzled about why Gregory is so
      enraged. The degree of his disturbance suggests that
      continued discussion of this topic in the medical media is
      both warranted and necessary. I regret that he mounted a
      character assassination of me as well. He would do better to
      remember that we live in a democracy.</p>

      <p>Thanks to Eleanor LeBourdais for her accurate article, <a
      href="/library/general/lebourdais/">Circumcision No Longer a
      Routine Surgical Procedure</a> (CMAJ 52: 1873&ndash;1876,
      June 1, 1995). Indeed, Canadian Provincial Health agencies
      have come to recognise that circumcision should no longer be
      paid for. In 1975, forty-four percent (44%) of males born in
      Canada were circumcised and paid for by Provincial Health
      agencies. By 1995, only four percent (4%) of male births had
      circumcisions paid for by Provincial or Territorial health
      agencies. (The number of recent circumcisions paid for
      privately is not known.) In a country where virtually all
      health care is paid for by Provincial or Territorial health
      agencies, these agencies have come, one by one, to the same
      significant conclusion, that the routine removal of normal
      penile tissue is contraindicated.</p>

      <p>There remain but three countries in the world (United
      States of America, Australia, and New Zealand) where the
      removal of normal penile tissue for nonreligious reasons is
      inflicted on significant numbers of unconsenting minors. This
      activity still has the tacit acquiescence of physicians in
      these countries.</p>
