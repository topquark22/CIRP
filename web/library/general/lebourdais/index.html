      <h2>CIRCUMCISION NO LONGER A "ROUTINE" SURGICAL
      PROCEDURE</h2>
      <b>Eleanor LeBourdais</b> 

      <blockquote>
        <p><small>In brief</small></p>

        <p><small>Nonmedical circumcision can no longer be
        considered routine in a new era of children's rights and
        more careful scrutiny of the medical necessity of surgical
        procedures. Although the minor procedure has been practised
        for centuries, custom, and cultural factors may have had
        greater influence on the incidence of circumcision than the
        prevalence of problems such as penile cancer and urinary
        tract infection that it was thought to prevent.</small></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>In April 1994, a motion to develop a position statement on
      the routine circumcision of male infants was rejected without
      debate during the annual meeting of the <a
      href="http://www.rnabc.bc.ca/" target="_blank">Registered
      Nurses Association of British Columbia</a>. The rejection
      followed strong objections from a group of Victoria nurses.
      Citing cultural, religious and freedom of choice issues as
      reasons, they suggested that neonatal circumcision is too
      controversial an issue and any such discussion would not be
      in the public interest.</p>

      <p>For a minor surgical procedure that has long been
      considered routine, circumcision has caused a surprising
      amount of debate in recent years. Although few people
      classify themselves as "pro-circumcision," conflicting
      viewpoints are still strong enough across Canada to generate
      debate when opinion articles appear in medical or nursing
      journals.</p>

      <p>Although circumcision has been practised for centuries,
      examination of the reasons for doing it has been a much more
      recent phenomenon. Classification of neonatal circumcision as
      a "routine" procedure has eliminated any need to question why
      it was done. If prophylaxis against urinary-tract infection,
      recurrent balanitis and penile or cervical cancer did not
      serve as a reason, then religion tradition or custom -
      "because father is" - often would.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP note: A "routine" circumcision is a
      non-therapeutic procedure, because no disease is present to
      be treated. Courts may take a different view of
      non-therapeutic procedures from that of therapeutic
      procedures when the procedure is performed on a minor who is
      legally incompetent to grant consent. See <a
      href="/library/legal/somerville1981/">Somerville</a> for more
      information.]</p>

      <p>"Routine" also effectively obscured awareness of
      circumcisions gone wrong when hemorrhage, infection, penile
      amputation and other problems occurred. As well, the belief
      that babies were not developed enough to sense pain shielded
      parents and many physicians from the reality that infants
      denied anesthesia did, indeed, feel every cut that was
      made.</p>

      <p>Custom and cultural factors, and not the prevalence of
      problems that circumcision was thought to prevent, appear to
      have had the greatest influence on the incidence of
      circumcision. In the US, where 80% of males are circumcised,
      the incidence of penile cancer is similar to that of
      Scandinavia, where circumcision is uncommon. In Israel, where
      circumcision is prevalent, the incidence of cervical cancer
      is similar to that in Scandinavia.</p>

      <p>The use of surgery to prevent possible urinary tract
      infection which can be readily treated without surgery, may
      have encouraged organizations such as the Canadian Paediatric
      Society (CPS) to begin viewing "routine" circumcision as
      unnecessary as early as <a
      href="/library/statements/cps1975/">1975</a>. Routine
      circumcision was similarly delisted as an insured service by
      provincial health ministries in the mid-1980s.</p>

      <p>In the 1990s, the likelihood of a baby being circumcised
      is influenced by an expanding array of usually nonmedical
      factors: circumcision status of the father, attitude of the
      mother, age of the attending physician, sex and circumcision
      status of the physician, geographic location and religion -
      factors that have little to do with the baby himself.</p>

      <p>In both Canada and the US, circumcision rates are lowest
      in the west and highest in the east. Hospitals involved in
      neonatology generally have higher rates than those that are
      not. In 1992, in BC only 37 circumcisions were performed for
      medical reasons such as phimosis, peripheral adhesions or
      balanitis were financed by public health insurance. Some 9400
      other circumcisions were performed the same year were classed
      as nonmedical procedures, giving BC a circumcision rate of
      about 40% for the 23,509 males born there that year.</p>

      <p>The performance of unnecessary circumcision on minors who
      have no say in the matter does not sit well with many people
      who consider circumcision a violation of basic human rights -
      specifically an infant's right to the respect and autonomy
      fundamental to Canadian law. The law recognizes a person as
      an autonomous decision maker whose rights are guaranteed
      within provision of the <a
      href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/annex_e.html#I"
      target="_blank">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a>.
      Section 7 provides for life liberty and security of the
      person. Section 2(a) guarantees the right to freedom of
      thought, conscience and religion, while section 15(l)
      guarantees equality in protection and legal benefit
      regardless of age.</p>

      <p>Removal of a healthy body part without medical indication
      has been viewed as being a violation of the Hippocratic oath,
      falling under the United Nations' definition of genital
      mutilation. As such circumcision is seen as being against the
      <a href="/library/ethics/UN-human/">Universal Declaration of
      Human Rights</a> and the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-declaration/">Declaration on the
      Rights of the Child</a>.</p>

      <p>Some opponents suggest that body altering measures
      conduced for religious reasons should be postponed until the
      child is old enough to make his own decision. They say such
      an approach is not denial of religious or cultural freedom so
      much as preservation of the child's right to choose and have
      his own beliefs.</p>

      <p>In BC the <a
      href="http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/I/96223_01.htm"
      target="_blank">Infants Act</a> stipulates that a child
      should be accorded the same protection under law as adults:
      if an adult cannot be forced to undergo circumcision in adult
      hood it follows that he shouldn't be forced to have it in
      infancy simply because he is too small to resist.</p>

      <p>Although ostensibly done for the child's benefit, non
      therapeutic circumcision is treatment that may not really be
      in the best interests of the child. The CPS has suggested
      that the primary concern of physicians caring for children
      must be just that. It defines "best interests" as the balance
      of potential benefits over potential harm or distress
      resulting from a pursuit of a given type of treatment.</p>

      <p>Evidence that some recipients of nonmedical circumcision
      consider themselves harmed may be found in the formation of
      groups such as RECAP (RECover A Penis) which was established
      in the US in 1990; members have attempted various methods of
      recovering their lost foreskins. In 1988, a Vancouver
      urologist was obliged to pay $40,000 in damages to a patient
      who required plastic surgery as an adult because of a
      circumcision performed when the patient was 12.</p>

      <p>Since the mid-1980s, members of ETHIC (End the Horror of
      Infant Circumcision), a loose coalition of concerned
      Canadians, have repeatedly called upon the CPS, provincial
      colleges of physicians and surgeons and other organizations
      to take a stand on the issue , a request that has been
      repeatedly denied.</p>

      <p>Janet Ecker, director of policy research and analysis at
      the <a href="http://www.cpso.on.ca/">College of Physicians
      and Surgeons of Ontario</a>, says the college has no position
      regarding male circumcision for non-medical purposes. "Due to
      a number of inquiries, the Executive Committee has considered
      the question of male circumcision and found there are a
      number of generally recognized medical indications for this
      procedure and as such it would be quite inappropriate for the
      college to consider prohibition of [it]."</p>

      <p>Rather than leaning toward restricting or prohibiting the
      procedure, Ecker points out that provisions of the <a
      href="http://www.canlii.org/on/laws/sta/1991c.18/20060718/whole.html"
       target="_blank">Regulated Health Professions Act</a>
      governing physicians and 23 other health care professions in
      Ontario specifically exempt circumcision from subsection
      27(l) - the controlled-acts section of the legislation - if
      it is performed as part of a religious tradition. Therefore,
      by legislation, provision is made for the performance of
      nonmedical circumcision."</p>

      <p>Dr. Morris VanAndel, deputy registrar of the <a
      href="https://www.cpsbc.ca/cps" target="_blank">College of
      Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia</a>, says his
      organization has much the same viewpoint. "We have no
      position on male circumcision because we feel it is a medical
      decision. And where there may not be medical indications for
      doing it anymore, there still are cultural [reasons],
      especially [within] the Jewish faith. We're not about to make
      a policy statement on a medical decision, we don't have a
      policy on gallbladders either."</p>

      <p>VanAndel acknowledges that the position is not absolute
      and in the future the college might produce some sort of
      guideline stating that routine circumcision of infants is
      unnecessary and required only for certain medical conditions.
      "We have guidelines for who should have mammograms, prostate
      testing, for many things. If there's a demand for it, we
      might have a guideline [stating] which infants should or
      should not be circumcised, but we're not likely to be making
      a statement of protocol on it."</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: In actual fact, the CPSBC
      subsequently issued a <a
      href="https://www.cpsbc.ca/cps/physician_resources/publications/resource_manual/malecircum"
       target="_blank">position statement</a> on circumcision of
      male children in 2004.]</p>

      <p>Organizations specifically concerned with child health and
      child welfare have similarly made no statements or only
      limited ones on circumcision. The <a
      href="http://www.cich.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian Institute
      of Child Health</a>, which is secretariat for the Postpartum
      Parent Support Group, has no "official position that can be
      reported," says national project coordinator Susan Hodges.
      However a program leaflet distributed by <a
      href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/" target="_blank">Health
      Canada</a> notes that "there appear to be no medical reasons
      for circumcision of an infant." It says the main advantage of
      foregoing circumcision involves the avoidance of
      surgery-related risks such as bleeding, infection, surgical
      trauma and pain.</p>

      <p>In its yet to be published statement, <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/position/cps.html"
      target="_blank"><i>Neonatal Circumcision Revisited</i></a>,
      the CPS essentially reiterates the conclusions its Fetus and
      Newborn Committee reached in <a
      href="/library/statements/cps1975/">1975</a>. "A careful
      review of the potential benefits (including the reported
      decrease in urinary tract infection) and the complications of
      does not support this as a routine procedure. The available
      evidence does not indicate that routine neonatal circumcision
      would be cost effective."</p>

      <p>Some opposition to nonmedical circumcision has involved
      subjecting infants to needless pain and suffering. Many
      physicians continue to perform circumcision without
      anesthesia, and some are reluctant to employ any analgesic
      measures whatever. "I strongly disagree with the use of any
      form of analgesia with this procedure," says Dr. Robert
      Brown, a family physician in Abbotsford, BC. Certainly pain
      is experienced but this pain does not appear to last any
      longer than 15 seconds after the procedure, as it is always
      easy to comfort the infant and have him stop crying."</p>

      <p>While some pediatricans and family physicians have begun
      to use <a href="/library/pain/kirya1/">dorsal penile nerve
      block</a>, currently the only form of anesthesia considered
      safe for newborns, the procedure requires expertise and till
      obliges the infant to endure painful needles.</p>

      <p>In its new statement, the CPS suggests that further study
      of adequate levels of analgesia is required. "The most
      effective and least risky type of analgesia remains to be
      clarified. No currently available method of pain control
      during and following circumcision is fully satisfactory."</p>

      <p>Concern about causing infants unnecessary pain has
      encouraged some physicians to refuse any involvement with
      circumcision. I had somebody the other day," says one
      Vancouver family physician, who insisted on circumcision and
      I said in that case you'll have to call up a pediatric
      surgeon and arrange it yourself. I would give them the name
      of a pediatrician but would refuse to refer them."</p>

      <p>As a pediatrician heavily involved in neonatology, Dr.
      Paul Thiessen of Vancouver has been using local anesthesia
      since late 1991 for the roughly 10 circumcisions he performs
      monthly at the <a href="http://www.cw.bc.ca/index.asp"
      target="_blank">BC Women's Hospital</a> (formerly Grace
      Hospital). Although anesthesia can substantially decrease or
      possibly eliminate surgical pain, he doesn't think
      circumcision should be done routinely.</p>

      <p>"I think nature put the foreskin there for a reason and
      when parents ask my opinion I say there may be increased
      incidence of urinary tract infection in the year of life that
      may [result from] not being circumcised, but I think that on
      balance I would leave well enough alone."</p>

      <p>With its removal from medicare coverage, nonmedical
      circumcision became a billable item for which parents in BC
      pay physicians $50 to $100 and hospitals up to $100. Removal
      from insurance coverage also made circumcision a procedure
      that could be done away from hospitals an inaccurate
      indication of the true incidence.</p>

      <p>Opponents suggest that circumcisions have become a means
      of easy money for some physicians who perform them in their
      offices. "You could do that sure," acknowledges Thiessen,
      "but you'd have to purchase the equipment get it sterilized
      and so on, and frankly why would anyone want to do that. I
      don't personally know of anyone doing it."</p>

      <p>While governments, medical associations and other groups
      have been reluctant to take a stand against non-medical
      circumcision, their response to the "circumcision" of young
      girls - commonly called female genital mutilation (FGM) in
      the West - has been quite different. (According to a fact
      sheet, female circumcision, or FGM, takes many forms. Most
      common are removal of the clitoral prepuce, excision of the
      clitoris, or removal of the clitoris and labia minora and
      occasionally much of the labia majora, suturing the two sides
      together to occlude the vagina. The procedures are usually
      performed prior to adolescence.) Countries such as Sweden,
      Great Britain and France have had no qualms about enacting
      legislation banning FGM. And when violations occur, there is
      no reluctance to enforce the law. In France, a woman from
      Gambia recently received a five year sentence for
      "circumcising" her two daughters.</p>

      <p>In Canada, the federal <a
      href="http://www.canada.justice.gc.ca/"
      target="_blank">Department of Justice</a> warns that anyone
      performing any type of surgery for cultural, religious or
      cosmetic reasons may be prosecuted under assault provisions
      of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/index.html"
      target="_blank">Criminal Code</a>. No such warnings have been
      issued about the much more widespread practice of cultural,
      religious or cosmetic surgery involving male genitals,
      despite the existence of human-rights legislation that
      prohibits discrimination based on sex.</p>

      <p>In March 1992 the colleges of physicians and surgeons in
      Ontario and BC banned the performance of FGM by their
      members, ruling it an act of professional misconduct. The
      Ontario college further ruled that any physician aware of
      such a procedure must advise the college about it.</p>

      <p>VanAndel, spokesman for the BC college, says the absence
      of any medical reason for *ever* performing FGM renders any
      comparison of male and female circumcision spurious, "My
      suggestion is that it's apples and oranges, It happens to
      involve the same area but the problems with it and reasons
      for doing it are widely different. Female circumcision is
      extremely disfiguring and potentially hazardous procedure.
      Male circumcision doesn't carry all of the baggage that
      female circumcision does, so I don't think it is logical to
      compare them and transform this into a gender-equality
      issue."</p>

      <p>Although the practice of female circumcision is relatively
      new in the West, where it is considered abhorrent, there is a
      very different perception in some forty countries where it is
      the norm, and often has been for centuries. Although it was
      outlawed in 1947, women and young girls in Somalia continue
      to view circumcision as a painful but still desirable tenet
      of their society and their culture.</p>

      <p>Earlier efforts to ban female circumcision in Sudan in
      1946 were met with a rush to perform FGM before the law took
      effect. Widely seen as alien to the countries social system
      and way of life, the legislation was never accepted and was
      ultimately perceived as a failure.</p>

      <p>In studies of women in Somalia, where virtually all
      females undergo FGM, approval of female circumcision appears
      universal irrespective of educational or economic status.</p>

      <p>Reasons for wanting circumcision commonly relate to the
      erroneous but still widespread belief that Islamic religion
      requires it, and the equally widespread belief that no man
      will marry an "uncircumcised" girl. The connection between
      female circumcision and adult status is so entrenched that
      Somali women have great difficulty conceiving that it is not
      a necessary part of womanhood. In view of previous
      legislative failures, the education of medical students,
      nurses, midwives and the general public is seen as the only
      way to eventually change social attitudes, and subsequently
      reduce the incidence of FGM.</p>

      <p>With an estimated 85 to 114 million women having been
      circumcised around the world, and with some 5500 girls
      undergoing the procedure each day, its acceptability clearly
      relates to the society and perspective from which it is being
      viewed. In the West, the circumcision of male infants has had
      the same widespead acceptance and long-term history.</p>

      <p>Children will likely continue to be governed by the
      viewpoints of their parents, but a new era of human rights
      and children's rights has brought a new variable into the
      equation. The physician who performs circumcision may someday
      find himself subject to legislative sanction, or even be
      charged with sexual assault. A May 1994 <a
      href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1994/1994rcs2-165/1994rcs2-165.html"
       target="_blank">decision</a> of the <a
      href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/" target="_blank">Supreme
      Court of Canada</a> placed the best interest of the child
      above parental rights.</p>

      <p>In the 1990s, circumcision clearly can no longer be
      regarded as a routine procedure.</p>
