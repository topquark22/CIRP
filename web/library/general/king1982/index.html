      <p class="cirp">CIRP Comment: Dr. Lowell King served on the
      <i>ad hoc</i> task force that wrote the historic 1975 policy
      statement regarding neonatal circumcision that started the
      trend toward genital integrity in the United States. Later,
      in 1982 he set forth some of the considerations of that
      committee. This paper, therefore, is of some historic
      interest.<br />
       This paper is dated in many ways. Some of the medical
      information in this paper is not current. For example, we now
      know that, for most boys, the foreskin typically becomes
      retractable at an older age than given in this paper. Also,
      there is absolutely no concern expressed for the pain of
      circumcision and there is no real consideration of the
      ethical issues raised by performing a non-therapeutic,
      irreversible, injurious, amputative operation on a
      non-consenting minor child.</p>

      <h4>COMMENTARY</h4>

      <p class="title">NEONATAL CIRCUMCISION IN THE UNITED STATES
      IN 1982</p>

      <p class="text1">In 1972 a committee on the fetus and the
      newborn asked their parent body, the American Academy of
      Pediatrics, to study the desirability of neonatal
      circumcision. The reasons for this request were 2-fold: 1) a
      concern about needless surgery causing pain and suffering,
      and 2) the thought that the insurance dollars spent on
      neonatal circumcision would cover the costs of neonatal
      intensive care. At the time family healthy insurance policies
      commonly excluded newborns for the first 15 days after
      birth.</p>

      <p class="text2">Successive ad hoc committees struggled with
      the issue. American parents and physicians had adopted an
      uncritical attitude to neonatal circumcision and about 92
      percent of the boys born in Illinois in 1975 were being
      circumcised as neonates. This rate was thought to be typical
      of the United States as a whole.</p>

      <p class="text2">After careful review of the literature then
      available the ad hoc committee reached various
      conclusions.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">1) Circumcision prevents carcinoma of the
      penis but this is such a rare malignancy that routine
      circumcision is an inefficient means of prevention.
      Retraction of the foreskin and simply washing the glans
      during baths also are effective means of preventing future
      carcinoma.</p>

      <p class="text2">2) There was no compelling evidence that
      noncircumcision increased the the incidence of carcinoma of
      the cervix in sexual partners. Cervical carcinoma rates are
      low in Israel, where most boys are circumcised, but also are
      low in Finland, where circumcision is unusual. Genetic
      resistance to cancer of the cervix is a tempting alternative
      explanation.</p>

      <p class="text2">3) Circumcision does not protect against
      venereal disease.</p>

      <p class="text2">4) Neonatal circumcision disposes to
      meatitis and meatal stenosis. Such stenosis is a common
      reason for subsequent meatomy or other operation.
      Circumcision injuries are not really rare.</p>

      <p class="text2">5) Circumcision should not be performed on
      sick or premature neonates, especially those with blood
      dyscrasia, hypospadias or related penile anomalies.</p>

      <p class="text2">6) Circumcision does make later instruction
      in special penile hygiene necessary but such hygiene consists
      of simple clearliness and assurance that the child washes
      under foreskins during baths that he later does himself after
      the foreskin has become retractable.</p>

      <p class="text2">The report concluded that &ldquo;there is no
      absolute medical indication for routine circumcision of the
      newborn&rdquo; and advised informed consent, suggesting that
      prospective parents decide at leisure before birth whether
      they wanted a boy circumcised. This report received a mixed
      reception. In general, pediatricians have become aware that
      neonatal circumcision is unnecessary. Debate has centered on
      when and how to retract the prepuce. The view that since the
      prepuce and glans develop from the same block of tissue
      painless retraction without breaking up synechaie should not
      be expected until the child is 3 to 6 years old and only now
      is becoming accepted. Obstetricians continue to account for
      the circumcision of a large majority of male newborns in the
      United States. Slotkowski and King recently sampled Illinois
      hospitals and found that the neonatal circumcision rate to be
      88 percent in the wake of considerable efforts at parental
      education.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> One hospital
      continues to have a high circumcision rate even though the
      noncircumcision option has been incorporated into the
      operative consent form. The circumcision rate had decreased
      precipitously in only 2 responding hospitals.</p>

      <p class="text2">Recently, the question of whether neonatal
      circumcision protects male newborns from urinary tract
      infection has arisen. Most male neonates that get urinary
      tract infections from underlying anatomical abnormalities of
      the urinary tract and they are often severe in degree.
      However, in one series only 5 percent of the male infants
      with such urinary tract infections had been circumcised. The
      significance of this observation is unclear. However, urinary
      tract infections in infants are so uncommon that it would
      seem like carcinoma of the penis, inefficient to try to
      protect male infants from urinary tract infection by
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text2">Parents faced with the decision on an
      informal basis probably are given more information than they
      desire. A common response on learning that circumcision is
      medically unnecessary is, &ldquo;but doctor, we want our boy
      to look like this brother(s).&rdquo; In short, Americans have
      come to regard neonatal circumcision as inherently desirable
      and difficult to guess how long this attitude will prevail.
      If neonatal circumcision is not elected parents will seek out
      someone to perform the circumcision when the child is several
      months or even years old.</p>

      <p class="text2">Urologists who do neonatal circumcisions are
      affected by the latter trend and generally are the physicians
      who evaluate questionable meatal stenosis and treat
      circumcision injuries.</p>

      <p class="text2">The impact of the latter is considerable.
      Circumcision can be safe. During one period 500,000
      consecutive circumcisions were performed in New York City
      without fatality. This is feasible if the circumcision is
      deferred until the infant is at least 1 day old and is tested
      for bleeding tendencies. Obviously, circumcision should be
      deferred in boys with a family history of excessive
      bleeding.</p>

      <p class="text2">On the other hand, circumcisions do lead to
      complications. The common problems usually are not serious.
      1) Asymetrical removal of the foreskin may require
      recircumcision for cosmetic purposes. 2) Bleeding from an
      artery or vein may require secondary ligation. 3) the suture
      line may become infected and although usually responsive to
      local treatment, the staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome may
      result.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> 4) Meatal stenosis
      probably is the most common potentially adverse result of
      neonatal circumcision. Loss of the covering foreskin
      predisposes to meatitis. Healing narrows the meatus,
      sometimes to a pinpoint that may diminish the or angulate the
      urinary stream. Meatotomy may be required but often is
      performed just because the meatus looks narrow. However, like
      any stricture a small meatus may continue to narrow or fail
      to enlarge with growth to a degree that decreases the stream
      and reduces the flow rate. In extreme instances bladder
      decompensation or ulrinary retention may result. 5) Phimosis
      in male infants is caused by incomplete circumcision. The
      reapproximation line between the skin and deep preputial
      layer heals by scar. When the scar contracts the remaining
      foreskin cannot be retracted and re-circumcision is
      necessary. If excessive skin has been removed a concealed
      penis results until re-circumcision liberates the shaft.</p>

      <p class="text2">Taken in aggregate these relative minor
      complications of neonatal circumcision are relatively common,
      perhaps 1 in 15 to 20 boys. Unfortunately, there is worse to
      come. Serious complications of neonatal circumcision are
      unusual but not rare. 1) Removal of excessive skin of the
      penile shaft may result in a concealed penis, alluded to
      previously, or a denuded penis. The skin edges must be
      mobilized and re-sutured or the shaft should be buried in the
      scrotum to pick up new, eventually hair-bearing, skin. 2) If
      the urethra is caught in a circumcision clamp the injury
      usually is a fistula at the corona, where closure may be
      difficult and 2 operations often are needed. 3) The glans or
      even penis itself may be amputated. Reanastomosis should be
      attempted using microsurgical techniques, which have been
      successful. 4) Cautery, applied to the bell of a Gomco clamp,
      has resulted in glanular slough. Cautery also has burned the
      penis completely when applied to circumcision clamps. These
      complications can be terrible and usually are the result of
      the use of a circumcision clamp by inexperienced operators.
      Free hand techniques are much preferred by the occasional
      operator, although circumcision clamps are safe and effective
      when used by trained personnel.</p>

      <p class="text2">Fortunately, new microsurgical techniques
      allow construction of a missing penis from revascularized and
      reinnervated grafts. These patients eventually can be fitted
      with a penile prosthesis for erection, permitting
      intercourse. However the nerve endings of the glans cannot be
      replaced. Obviously boys who lose the penis in infancy should
      continue to be reared and reconstructed as girls.</p>

      <p class="text2">Routine infant circumcision continues to be
      uniquely popular in the United States. However, a
      noncircumcision trend may be gathering momentum slowly.
      Success of this movement will depend on the realization and
      acceptance of the fact that the noncircumcised penis does not
      require any treatment. Our population must learn that full
      retraction of the prepuce should not be expected until the
      child is 3 to 6 years old, although occasional foreskins are
      readily retractable at birth and that penile hygiene consists
      of learning to wash under the foreskin after it becomes
      retractile, just as a child learns to wash behind and in the
      ears. Meanwhile, complications of neonatal circumcision
      continue. Some, such as meatal stenosis, bleeding and
      infection, are inherent risks of the procedure. Others, such
      excessive or inadequate skin removal, urethral fistula and
      damage to the glans or penile shaft, probably would diminish,
      if not disappear, if occasional practitioners of the art of
      circumcision would eschew blind or semi-blind clamps and use
      a free-hand open surgical technique.</p>
