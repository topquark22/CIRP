        <h2>SAVE THE NORMAL FORESKIN</h2>

        <p><b>By Andrew Gordon and Jack Collin</b></p>

        <p><b>Widespread confusion over what the medical
        indications for circumcision are.</b></p>
      </div>

      <p class="text2">Religious considerations apart, the
      commonest indications for circumcision in current surgical
      practice are phimosis, preputial adhesions, ballooning of the
      foreskin and balanitis. Although these indications are widely
      accepted, consideration of the embryology, development, and
      pathology of the prepuce suggests that their validity is open
      to doubt.</p>

      <p class="text2">The foreskin develops early in intrauterine
      life as a protuberance of penile epidermis that grows
      forwards over the glans and adheres to it. Both glans and
      prepuce are covered by stratified squamous epithelium, and
      separation occurs at a variable time from before birth to
      several years afterwards by desquamation. The term phimosis
      (from the greek word for muzzling) is often incorrectly
      applied to any foreskin that cannot be retracted.</p>

      <p class="text2">To discourage unnecessary circumcision a
      distinction needs to be made between physiological and
      pathological non-retractability. <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a>, who examined
      a large number of normal children during their first five
      months of life, observed that at birth only 4% of children
      had fully retractile prepuces, while in half the prepuce was
      partially retractile.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> By the
      age of 5 years slightly more than 90% of boys had retractile
      foreskins.</p>

      <p class="text2">Additional information was provided by <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">&Oslash;ster</a>, who examined
      almost 2000 schoolchildren between the ages of 6 and 17 in
      whom no medical or surgical intervention had taken
      place.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> In the 6-7 year age
      group 91% of boys had retractile prepuces (a similar figure
      to that of Gairdner) and the incidence of spontaneously
      retractile foreskin increased yearly until by 17 years only
      1% remained non-retractile. Why this 1% of 17 year olds still
      had a non-retractile foreskin was not stated, but data from a
      <a href="/library/treatment/phimosis/rickwood/">subsequent
      study</a> suggest that they were probably suffering from
      balanitis xerotica obliterans.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup>
      This curious condition of unknown aetiology is characterised
      by dermal oedema, lymphocytic infiltration, basal cell
      degeneration, and atrophy of the stratum malpighii. Although
      resolution, successful medical treatment, and recently, laser
      treatment for balanitis xerotica obliterans have been
      reported,<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> circumcision remains
      the mainstay of treatment. The condition may, however, also
      involve the glans or urethral meatus, resulting in meatal
      stenosis.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Other indications for circumcision are less
      clear cut, but few would dispute that recurrent
      balanoposthitis warrants surgical treatment. Despite the
      clinical impression that balanitis is common in young boys,
      the only detailed study of this condition reported an
      incidence of 4% in all boys aged up to 14.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> A specific organism was found in only
      about one third of cases, and the aetiology was uncertain.
      The incidence may be higher in uncircumcised children before
      the age of 8, although morbidity due to balanoposthitis may
      be offset at least partly by penile problems in children who
      are circumcised.<sup><a href="#n7">7,8</a></sup> Although the
      inflammation is usually mild, on occasions it causes great
      distress. The condition, however, is self limiting, and few
      children suffer more than one episode.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup> Plainly a single attack of balanitis,
      which is sometimes seen in boys with normal foreskins, is not
      a sufficient indication for circumcision. One study found
      penile inflammation in one of seven uncircumcised children
      but most problems resolved after a single medical
      consultation.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The increased number of urinary tract
      infections seen in uncircumcised young children may be due to
      "hospital strains" of p fimbriated Escherichia coli acquired
      in the unnatural environment of modern obstetric units<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup> rather than being directly related to
      the foreskin. Paraphimosis is rare in children and unlikely
      to account for a substantial number of circumcisions.
      Although ballooning on micturition is a commonly cited
      indication, the studies of <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a><sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> and <a
      href="/library/general/oster/">&Oslash;ster</a><sup><a
      href="#n2">2</a></sup> suggest that if this physical sign is
      ignored the symptoms will resolve as the foreskin becomes
      spontaneously retractile (unless balanitis xerotica
      obliterans develops). Preputial adhesions represent a stage
      in the normal process of separation of the two epithelial
      surfaces of the prepuce and glans. In &Oslash;ster's study no
      preputial adhesions were seen in 95 boys aged 17, none of
      whom had undergone any operative procedure for separation of
      adhesions<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> - strongly suggesting
      that adhesions resolve themselves spontaneously without
      treatment.</p>

      <p class="text2">These data suggest that overall between 1%
      and 2% of boys need circumcision for medical indications. The
      cumulative national rate of circumcision for boys by the age
      of 15 is almost 7%.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> If <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/rickwood2/">findings from
      Liverpool</a> are representative of the rest of
      Britain<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup> then many unnecessary
      circumcisions are being performed. each year at considerable
      cost to the health service and morbidity for patients. In the
      population served by the Oxford Regional Health Authority
      during the year to September 1990, 978 boys were circumcised
      out of a total estimated population of 299600 - a rate of
      0.33% a year (statistics unit of Oxford Regional Health
      Authority). If this rate operated annually then 5.6% of boys
      aged 17 would be circumcised - not substantially different
      from the <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/rickwood2/">Mersey
      figure</a>.<sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p class="CIRP">[CIRP Note: Gordon and Collin estimated in
        1993 that only about 1% and 2% of boys needed circumcision
        for medical indications. Since then, many non-destructive,
        non-traumatic, effective treatments for balanitis and
        non-retractile foreskin have been developed.</p>

        <p class="CIRP"><a
        href="/library/disease/balanitis/birley/">Birley et al.</a>
        noted that balanitis can be caused by excessive washing. It
        can usually be managed by correcting the overzealous
        hygiene, and by application of emollients.</p>

        <p class="CIRP"><a
        href="/library/treatment/phimosis/orsola1/">Medical
        treatment of non-retractile foreskin</a> with betamethasone
        valerate 0.05% ointment has a documented 90% success rate.
        Full implementation of conservative non-traumatic
        <i>medical</i> treatment of nonretractile foreskin could
        cut the number of <i>surgical</i> operations needed by
        ten-fold. Presumably, if Gordon and Collin were to revisit
        this matter, their estimate of the percentage of boys who
        actually need surgery would drop to between 0.1% and 0.2%.
        Furthermore, for those very few boys who do need surgery,
        non-traumatic, non-destructive <a
        href="/library/treatment/phimosis/cuckow/">dorsal slit with
        transverse closure</a> or <a
        href="/library/treatment/phimosis/south1/">lateral
        preputioplasty</a> may be effective and would preserve full
        anatomical function.</p>

        <p class="CIRP">Full application of newer non-traumatic
        medical and surgical treatments should almost totally
        eliminate the need for circumcision in medical
        practice.]</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text2">Why then is the rate of circumcision up to
      six times greater than the incidence of preputial disease?
      Analysis of the clinical findings in children referred for
      circumcision reported in this week's journal suggests a
      difference in interpretation of symptoms and clinical signs
      between surgeons and general practitioners (p 28).<sup><a
      href="#n11">11</a></sup> Clearly confusion still exists about
      what constitutes "pathological" phimosis as distinct from
      "physiological" non-retractile foreskin. Most cases of
      pathological phimosis result from balanitis xerotica
      obliterans, while the remainder may be due to a different,
      distinct fibrotic disease.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup>
      The underlying difficulty is the imprecision of the term
      phimosis. An important consideration is that balanitis
      xerotica obliterans usually develops after 5 years.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5,10</a></sup> The rarity of of pathological
      phimosis under the age of 5 is an important observation since
      most circumcisions are performed before this age.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2"><a
      href="/library/general/oster/">&Oslash;ster</a> wrote in the
      introduction to his paper<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> that
      the publication of <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner's article</a>
      nearly 20 years earlier seemed to have made no significant
      impression on clinical practice.<sup><a
      href="#n1">1</a></sup> Regrettably it seems that the same can
      be said more than 20 years after &Oslash;ster's paper was
      published. A better understanding of the normal physiology,
      developmental anatomy, and pathology of the prepuce could
      prevent the removal of thousands of normal foreskins over the
      next 20 years.</p>
