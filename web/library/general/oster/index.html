      <h2>Incidence of Preputial Adhesions, Phimosis, and Smegma
      among<br />
       Danish Schoolboys</h2>

      <p><font size="+1"><b>Jakob &Oslash;ster</b></font><br />

    <div class="corpus">
      <p class="text">There are three decisive dates in the history
      of the prepuce: the year 1713 BC, in which Abraham is said to
      have been circumcised as sign of the pact with Jehovah
      (Speert, 1953), the year 43 AD when Paul, at a religious
      meeting in Jerusalem resolved that it was the circumcision of
      the heart and not of the flesh that was the true way to
      salvation (Hand, 1950), and the year 1949 AD when Gairdner
      published work which, for the first time, presented facts
      illustrating the normal development of the prepuce. The two
      first events are of world-wide historical significance and
      have influenced the circumstances of millions of individuals.
      While the third event seems to have made no such impression
      as yet.* <font color="navy"><b>[CIRP note: The incidence of
      male neonatal circumcision has declined substantially in the
      English-speaking nations since the publication of this
      article in 1968.]</b></font></p>

      <p class="text">Many facts have still to be elucidated. What
      is smegma? Do sebaceous glands exist?&mdash;on the glans or
      the prepuce (Krompecher, 1932)? Is smegma carcinogenic and,
      if so, due to which components? What part does hygiene of the
      preputial space play in various diseases (Saltmacher, 1960;
      Kalcev, 1964)? What is the incidence of circumcision in the
      various groups of the population (Came, 1956; MacCarthy,
      Douglas, and Mogford, 1952; Osmond, 1953)? Why is cancer of
      the penis practically never observed in circumcised men
      (Bletch, 1950; Clemmensen, 1965)? Is there a connexion
      between cancer of the uterine cervix and circumcision in the
      sexual partners of these women? Is the low incidence of
      cervical cancer of the uterus in Jewish women due to racial
      differences, circumcision in the males, or general hygienic
      procedures (Bleich, 1950; Boldt, 1959)? May circumcision lead
      to ulcerative meatitis and secondary narrowing of the
      external urethral meatus (Berry and Gross, 1956; Morton,
      1963)? Is the mortality in connexion with circumcision,
      approximately 16 male infants annually in England and Wales
      in the period 1942-47, fallen with the introduction of modern
      anaesthesia and the prophylaxis of infection and haemorrhage
      (Speert, 1953)?</p>

      <p class="text">The development of the prepuce starts when
      the embryo is about 65 mm, and it covers the glans when the
      fetus is approximately 100 mm. (Broman, 1946; Hamilton, Boyd.
      and Mossman, 1952). The inner surface of the prepuce and the
      surface of the glans receive a common epithelium which
      separates at about the time of birth or later, possibly much
      later (<a href="/library/anatomy/deibert/">Deibert, 1933</a>;
      Gairdner, 1949). This common epithelium is mistakenly termed
      'adhesions' and, similarly, the separation is termed, also
      unfortunately, 'resolution of adhesions'.</p>

      <p class="text">Separation results from keratinization of the
      cells under the influence of androgen (Burrows, 1944),
      probably in a similar way to separation of the eyelids
      (Andersen, Ehlers, and Matthiessen, 1965), a highly
      complicated biological process. How and why this separation
      occurs is outside the scope of this article the object of
      which is to investigate when it occurs. <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner (1949)</a> found
      that the prepuce can only be retracted completely in 4% of
      newborn boys, in 54% the external meatus could just be seen,
      while in 42% the tip of the glans could not even be seen. At
      the age of 6 months, the prepuce could still not be retracted
      in 80%, and the corresponding figures at the ages of 1, 2,
      and 3 years were 5, 20, and 10% respectively. Gairdner added
      that, in 200 schoolboys between 5 and 13 years, the prepuce
      could not be retracted completely in 20%.</p>

      <p class="text">Gairdner's material originated from a
      population which was partially circumcised. The object here
      was to investigate the incidence of preputial 'adhesions',
      phimosis, and smegma production in an unselected group of
      Danish schoolboys.</p>

      <p align="center"><b>Material and Methods</b></p>

      <p class="text">As school medical officer in a town, the
      author had the task of examining a large population of
      children annually. The prepuces had not been the object of
      interest or of manipulation by doctors or parents, because in
      Denmark such a tradition has never existed.</p>

      <p class="text">The material comprises 9545 observations on
      the state of the prepuce in 1968 schoolboys aged 6-17 years,
      examined annually for up to 8 years from the academic year
      1957-58 till 1964-65. A smaller fraction of the material, 173
      boys, was examined annually for 7 years from 1958-59 till
      1964-65. Finally, continued observations on 1086 schoolboys
      from the last year of the investigation 1964-65, were made on
      the incidence of preputial &lsquo; adhesions&rsquo;, as
      control material for the other two groups.</p>

      <p class="text">The term <i>phimosis</i> implies that
      tightness prevents the prepuce from being retracted by gentle
      manipulation. The term <i>tight prepuce</i> indicates that
      the prepuce can be retracted, though with slight difficulty,
      so that it is possible to observe whether adhesions are
      present or not. The presence and extent of <i>preputial
      adhesions</i> could obviously only be assessed in those cases
      where no phimosis was present.</p>

      <p align="center"><b>Results</b></p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP note: &Oslash;ster presents information
      about the incidence of "phimosis", "tight foreskin", and
      "adhesions" in separate tables. This presentation has been
      found to be confusing to many. One must add the percentage
      incidence of these various conditions together to obtain the
      total number of boys in each age group with partially or
      completely non-retractable foreskins.]</p>

      <p class="text">Table I shows that phimosis was found in 4%
      of all observations, but with a diminishing incidence
      throughout the years, from 8% in 6-7 year-olds to 1% in 16-17
      year-olds. in addition, tight prepuce was present in 2%.</p>

      <p class="text">In the 9200 observations where no phimosis
      was present and where the preputial space could thus be
      inspected, smegma was present in 5% the incidence increasing
      from 1% in the 6-7 year-olds, to 8% in the 16-17 year-olds.
      Production of smegma appears to increase in quantity at the
      age of 12-13 years. Whenever smegma was noted at an
      examination, the boy concerned was instructed to retract the
      foreskin gently and to wash the preputial space in the bath.
      The above figures thus reflect both the incidence of smegma,
      and the efficacy of hygienic procedures. Nevertheless, it was
      clear that the presence of smegma was uncommon in 6-7
      year-old boys.</p>

      <p class="text">Table II shows that preputial adhesions were
      present in 33% of all schoolboys who did not have phimosis,
      with a diminishing incidence from 63% in 6-7 year-olds to 3%
      in 16-17 year-olds. No adhesions were noted amongst 95
      17-year-old boys.</p>

      <p class="text">Table III shows the degree of adhesions. The
      incidence of pronounced adhesions is shown to be greater the
      younger the boys, while in the older age-group a slight
      degree of adhesions is often all that is to be found.
      Analysis of that part of the material consisting of 173 boys
      examined annually for 7 years in succession showed, as
      mentioned, a similar decrease in the incidence of adhesions
      throughout the years as in the total material. The various
      degrees of severity were also distributed as in the total
      material, and the incidence of phimosis of 49 out of 1209
      observations, or 4%, is the same as that in the total
      material. If the 173 boys are considered individually,
      phimosis was observed at one time or another and disappeared
      spontaneously in 11; 9 of these had phimosis on entering
      school and in 2 it began at 10 years. In 3 further boys (2%
      phimosis occurred in the course of school life at the ages of
      10, 10, and 12 years, respectively, and was such that surgery
      was required, which was undertaken at the ages of 14, 11, and
      13 years, respectively. Thus, in 14 out of the 173 boys or
      (8%) phimosis was observed at one time or another during
      school life. Only 4 out of the 173 boys had had their
      prepuces dilated by their general practitioners before school
      age, and in all 4 of these the prepuce developed normally
      during school life, either as a result of, or despite, the
      treatment administered. None of the boys had been circumcised
      before school age, Similar conditions also prevailed in the
      total material.</p>

      <p><b>Discussion and Conclusions</b></p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">Phimosis is seen to be
      uncommon in schoolboys, and the indications for operation
      even rarer if the normal development of the prepuce is
      patiently awaited. When this policy is pursued, in the
      majority of cases of phimosis, it is seen to be a
      physiological condition which gradually disappears as the
      tissues develop.</span> There is, however, a possibility that
      unphysiological secondary phimosis may occur in connexion
      with attempts to retract the prepuce, because tissue damage
      and scar formation may then occur. It is worth noting that
      the three boys mentioned in whom operation was required, only
      developed phimosis after several years of school, raising the
      possibility that the phimosis in these cases may have been
      iatrogenic, a sequel to the attempts at retraction in the
      preceding years, despite the author's attempts at
      gentleness.</p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">The common epithelium of
      the glans and the prepuce separates gradually and
      spontaneously in the course of childhood, a process that may
      not be complete until the age of 17.</span> The rate of fall
      in the incidence of adhesions throughout school life is
      constant, providing no evidence for the epithelial separation
      being of hormonal origin as a result of puberty. The
      production of smegma increases from the age of 12-13, but our
      actual figures for the incidence of smegma can only be of
      limited significance, as the boys received regular
      instruction about preputial hygiene. The facts presented hare
      are in entire agreement with the comment made by <a
      href="/library/general/spence1/">Sir James Spence</a> of
      Newcastle upon Tyne (1964):</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          'The anatomists have not studied the form and the
          evolution of the preputial orifice . . . they do not
          understand that Nature does not intend it to be stretched
          or retracted . . . What looks like a pin point opening at
          7 months will become a wide channel of communication at
          17 . . . Nature is a possessive mistress, and whatever
          mistakes she makes about the structure of the less
          essential organs such as the brain and stomach, In which
          she is not much interested, you can be sure that she
          knows best of the genital organs.'
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p align="center"><b>Summary and Conclusions</b></p>

      <p class="text">From 9545 observations of the state of the
      prepuce in 1968 schoolboys aged 6-17 years, examined annually
      for up to eight years, the following was concluded.</p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">Physiological phimosis
      is a rare condition in schoolboys, and it has a tendency to
      regress spontaneously: operation is rarely indicated. Clumsy
      attempts at retraction probably cause secondary phimosis,
      which then requires operation.</span></p>

      <p class="text"><span class="yellow">Preputial non-separation
      ('adhesion') occurs frequently, but separation of the
      epithelium takes place gradually and spontaneously as a
      normal biological process in the course of school life and is
      concluded about the age of 17.</span></p>

      <p class="text">Production of smegma increases from the age
      of about 12-13 years. Neither this nor hygiene of the prepuce
      present any problems if the boys are regularly
      instructed.</p>
