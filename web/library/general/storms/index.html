      <h3>AAFP Fact Sheet on Neonatal Circumcision: A Need for
      Updating</h3>

      <p><small>TO THE EDITOR</small>: Several recently published
      studies demonstrate the need for complete revision of the
      American Academy of Family Physicians "Fact Sheet for
      Physicians Regarding Neonatal Circumcision."[<a
      href="#n1">1</a>] Any physician caring for infant boys should
      investigate other sources.</p>

      <p>Recent retrospective studies[<a href="#n2">2</a>] have
      estimated the neonatal circumcision complication rate to be
      more than five times higher than reported in the fact sheet.
      The complication rate is significantly higher than that
      reported for postneonatal circumcision.</p>

      <p>The number of circumcised men developing penile cancer has
      been increasing. Of 110 cases of penile cancer, 41 (37
      percent) were circumcised, with 22 (20 percent) having been
      circumcised in the newborn period.[<a href="#n3">3</a>]
      Genital warts and smoking were the strongest predictors of
      penile cancer. Data from Denmark indicate that the incidence
      of penile cancer is lower in Denmark than in the United
      States. Approximately 1.6 percent of Danish men are
      circumcised. The incidence of penile cancer has been
      declining for the past 50 years in Denmark.[<a
      href="#n4">4</a>]</p>

      <p>The statement "Virtually all sexually transmitted diseases
      occur more frequently among uncircumcised men" may no longer
      be true. Recent studies have demonstrated that circumcised
      men are at increased risk of contracting gonorrhea, syphilis
      and genital warts.[<a href="#n5">5,6</a>] Men are at equal
      risk for developing human papillomavirus lesions and
      herpesvirus infections regardless of circumcision status.[<a
      href="#n3">3,7</a>] At least four studies have shown human
      immunodeficiency virus infection to occur more commonly in
      circumcised men.[<a href="#n8">8</a>]</p>

      <p>If linear regression analysis is applied to the
      relationship between circumcision rates and the prevalence of
      acquired immunodeficency syndrome in industrialized countries
      (using 1994 World Health Organization data) and weighted for
      population, a strongly positive correlation between
      circumcision and the prevalence of AIDS is found. While this
      does not prove that circumcision is a risk factor for AIDS,
      it is clear that the circumcision experiment in the United
      States did not prevent the spread of the infection.</p>

      <p>It is now believed that neonates perceive stimuli to be
      more painful than older infants. The impact of a painful
      experience may have long-term ramifications. A recent study
      demonstrated that boys circumcised in the neonatal period
      cried longer and harder after their first set of
      immunizations.[<a href="#n9">9</a>]</p>

      <p>Finally, the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on
      Bioethics recently cast doubt on whether a physician can
      ethically perform neonatal circumcisions.[<a
      href="#n10">10</a>] Since a newborn is not competent, neither
      informed consent nor patient assent can be obtained.
      Likewise, parental permission is only accceptable in
      situations where medical intervention has a clear and
      immediate necessity, such as disease, trauma, or deformity.
      Routine circumcision does not satisfy these requirements. The
      committee suggests that in nonessential treatments, which
      could be deferred without substantial risk, the physician and
      family wait until the child's consent can be obtained.
      Without proper consent, the delineation between performance
      of neonatal circumcision and assault and battery becomes
      indistinct.[<a href="#n11">11</a>]</p>
