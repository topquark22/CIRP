        <h2>THE FORESKIN SAGA</h2>

        <p><b>Jack R. Harnes, MD</b></p>
      </center>

      <p>A recent article, "Whither The Foreskin"<sup>1</sup> again
      questions the value of circumcision, a problem bandied about
      by physicians for years. It also calls attention to some
      fanciful titles for medical articles., eg. "Penile
      Plunder,"<sup>2</sup> "The Fate of The Foreskin,"<sup>3</sup>
      and "The Rape of the Phallus,"<sup>4</sup> a group I feel
      justified in joining.</p>

      <p>In June 1965, Morgan<sup>4</sup> attached circumcision as
      barbarous (I agree), of no health value (I am shocked), and
      resulting in decreased sexual pleasure in the male (I am
      depressed).</p>

      <p>I am certain that I was not alone among the circumcised
      readers of that article in becoming quite concerned. My
      father was a young physician at the time of my circumcision
      and presumably had it done with the best of intentions.
      Nonetheless, although I am not a psychiatrist, a number of
      questions came to my mind. Did this represent an unconscious
      attack by my father on my oedipus complex? was he aware of a
      future decreased pleasure the operation would incur and did
      this represent hatred of me? Did he, with my mother's
      consent, subconsciously want me castrated?</p>

      <p>What was done, was done. A search through the Index
      Medicus for the past 40 years revealed that no surgeon had
      reported developing a plastic procedure to replace the
      prepuce. In fact I did not even find any reference to any
      prosthetic device for this purpose. I spoke to several
      acquaintances in the field of both plastic surgery and
      plastic manufacturing and in all instances met with what
      amounted to a cold shoulder ("what are you, some kind of nut
      or something?"). Obviously, this kind of approach to my
      problem would prove fruitless.</p>

      <p>Of further concern, was the statement that circumcision no
      longer guaranteed me freedom from the fear of cancer of the
      penis. Daily inspection has failed to reveal any growth
      either on or of the organ, but there still remains an almost
      constant fear that I may face amputation.</p>

      <p>The smug look I noted on a number of my confreres during
      the period following the publication of Morgan's report did
      nothing to help my damaged ego. Was Morgan correct? Was I
      doomed to a life of unfulfilled sexual pleasure? Was the
      blissful sensation I had enjoyed merely a sham, a figment of
      my imagination? Obviously here was a problem that warranted
      the scientific investigation not cited in any reference by
      Morgan.</p>

      <p>I must report at the onset that my investigations were
      fruitless in solving the question. However, in the hope of
      preventing other investigators from pursuing similar
      approaches to the problem, I feel that publication of my
      failure is indicated.</p>

      <p>Method.- The first and obvious approach was to interview
      males who had been circumcised as adults. Letters were
      written to all board certified urologist in New York City
      explaining the nature of my investigation, providing of
      course, that the urologist had no objection to my
      interviewing his patients. The results of this inquiry are
      listed as follows:</p>
<pre>
       Sent          135
       Replies        29    (22%)
       (1) Lost to follow-up       27     (93%)*
       (2) "What are you, some
        kind of nut or something?" 24     (83%)
       *Unfortunately, the two patients apparently not
       lost to follow-up belonged to physicians listed
       in reply 2.
</pre>

      <p>The next approach attempted was to interview my own
      patients. The question as to when the men had been
      circumcised seemed to produce no problem but unfortunately
      the two men I discovered during the course of one year who
      were suitable for study were uncooperative during the
      interview and have been lost to follow-up. It is of course of
      some interest that during that year I noticed a gradual
      increase in the percentage of women patients, who now
      constitute 80% of my practice. The remaining 20% are men who
      have certain psychological problems which would make them
      unsuitable for the study. (I have recently noticed an
      increase in this type of male patient in my practice.)</p>

      <p>Then I encountered a 55-year-old stock analyst who had
      been circumcised for phimosis at age 20 years. He had had
      sexual surgery intercourse prior to the surgery. In
      retrospect (35 years in retrospect to be exact), the patient
      recalled that the two or three episodes of sexual intercourse
      he had prior to circumcision now seem to have been more
      pleasurable than subsequent episodes. It is perhaps pertinent
      to the evaluation of this sole bit of significant datum in
      the study to point out that immediately after spontaneously
      recounting this case history the subject launched into an
      enthusiastic discussion of his current hobby, bird watching,
      extolling the beauty of the female cow bird.</p>

      <p>It was apparent at this time that I would be unable to
      secure first-hand (or should I say second-hand?) facts for my
      study and that I must secure what is virtually hearsay
      information. However, it seemed reasonable to assume that
      women who may have had intercourse with circumcised and
      uncircumcised men might have noted some indication of
      difference in the men's pleasure.</p>

      <p>I first raised the question with my wife and office nurse.
      (Incidentally, readers requesting reprints of this article
      should note my new address.) Unfortunately, neither of these
      resources proved fruitful. However, I have learned that male
      nurses work well in an office situation, a point I do not
      believe is generally known.</p>

      <p>I next enlisted the support of an acquaintance on the vice
      squad of the New York Police Department. (Although I
      explained the scientific nature of this report, he had
      preferred to remain anonymous, citing the necessarily
      confidential nature of his work.) With his assistance I was
      able to interview 15 experienced prostitutes form all walk of
      life. Their replies were as follows:</p>
<pre>
       Interviewed                 15
       Replies                     15     (100%)

       "Whataya, some kind of nut
          or som't'in"             14     ( 93%)
       None (Did not speak
       English or French)           1     (  7%)
</pre>

      <p>Summary and Conclusion.- An attempt was made to ascertain
      the validity of the statement that circumcised men find
      sexual intercourse with women less pleasurable than do
      uncircumcised men. Various approaches to the question are
      enumerated. Unfortunately, the question remains unanswered.
      However in view of the emotional trauma this question has
      produced since being raised by Morgan, further investigation
      is warranted.</p>
