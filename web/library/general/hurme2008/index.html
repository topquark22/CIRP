      <h4>Circumcision of boys in Finland - a questionnaire to
      Finnish paediatric surgeons</h4>

      <p>We sent a questionare to surgeons treating
      children&rsquo;s phimosis and performing circumcision in
      Finland. We received responses from 90% of the hospitals,
      including 39 surgeons. 74% of the responders were paediatric
      surgeons and 18% were resident paediatric surgeons. They came
      from all parts of Finland so that the whole country was well
      covered.</p>

      <p>The incidence of operative treatment of phimosis has
      declined during the last ten years in Finland. The most
      common operation for adolescent balanitis xerotica obliterans
      is still circumcision. Preputial plasty is the most widely
      used method for prepubertal boys.</p>

      <p>Physiological phimosis is seldom an indication for
      operative treatment in patients under age of 5 years. Topical
      steroids are widely used in first line treatment of phimosis.
      The operation is selected on the basis of discussions with
      patients and parents. All operations are performed under
      general anesthesia.</p>

      <p>Non-medical circumcision is not performed in Finland
      except in a few hospitals. The most important reason for not
      performing cultural circumcision is that the total usefulness
      of the operation is questionable and that it does not benefit
      the boy&rsquo;s health.</p>

      <p>Circumcision does not belong to Finnish culture. The
      condition for performing a cultural circumcision is the
      informed consent of the boy himself. Over one third of the
      responders accept cultural circumcision only if it is
      performed by medical professionals, under general
      anaesthesia, and the costs are paid by the boy&rsquo;s
      parents. <span class="yellow">One third of the respondents,
      however, demanded criminalization of cultural circumcision of
      boys.</span></p>
