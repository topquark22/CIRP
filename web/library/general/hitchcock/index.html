      <p class="text1"><b>Commentary</b><br />
       The above paper by Schoen reflects the influence of culture
      and habit on the interpretation of medical practice. The
      practice of neonatal circumcision, so rare in Europe and
      ubquitous in the USA, has been discussed. The author credits
      Europe with avoiding neonatal circumcision on cost grounds. I
      think this is a basic misconception. The practice of medicine
      in Europe is far less invasive than in the US and medical
      intervention, particularly irreversible mutilating surgery,
      is avoided unless there is a proved medical benefit. The
      morbidity of neonatal circumcision is occasionally
      significant, and recent evidence demonstrating evidence of
      altered pain responses after neonatal circumcision suggests
      that the unperceived morbidity may be significantly
      higher.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">Balanitis xerotica obliterans is usually
      considered an absolute indication of childhood circumcision,
      but has an incidence significantly under 1%, with a peak
      incidence at 6-10 years. Balanoposthitis occurs in up to 4%
      of uncircumcised boys but fewer than 1 percent go on to three
      episodes or more of this minor local infection. Where these
      justify intervention we have learnt from our European
      colleagues of the value of preputioplasty, which saves the
      prepuce and has much less morbidity than circumcision. It is
      rare that physiological phimosis fails to resolve
      spontaneously and also is treatable by preputioplasty.</p>

      <p class="text2">Circumcision as an alternative to hygiene in
      prevention of penile carcinoma, is an oft voiced argument.
      The author has quoted figures based on the 1971 national
      cancer survey (US) and extrapolated from the unsupported
      assumptions that all penile carcinoma occurred in
      uncircumcised males.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> More
      recent data calculates the relative risk in the US to be 3.2
      times greater in the intact male.<sup><a
      href="#n3">3</a></sup> Using the author's own source, the
      quoted incidence of penile cancer is the US was one per
      100,000 (1969-71). This a comparable incidence with that in
      Finland<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> at the same time, where
      the circumcision rate is less than 1%, of 0.5 per 100 000
      (1970) with a 78% relative 20 year survival rate. Thus, I
      find Marshall's argument at a meeting of the Society for
      Paediatric Urology, that one would have to perform 140
      circumcisions a week for 25 years, to prevent one case of
      carcinoma of the penis, enough to prevent me from setting out
      on such a course.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">The strongest argument in favour of neonatal
      circumcision is the recognition that circumcision removes a
      reservoir of bacteria, associated with urinary tract
      infection, and indeed, in the child with an abnormal urinary
      tract where prophylaxis has failed to prevent urinary tract
      infection, I also practice circumcision. The author
      identifies, however, a paper that reports a pattern of male
      urinary tract infection in the first month, unassociated with
      renal tract anomaly, which we rarely see in the UK, and
      perhaps is linked to the practice of forcible preputial
      retraction (Rushton <i>et al</i><sup><a
      href="#n6">6</a></sup>, discussion). The protection of
      vulnerable infants with abnormal urinary tracts, possible
      pre-existing renal dysplasia, and a risk of new scar
      formation, would be better assured by renal ultrasound and
      family history screening.</p>

      <p class="text2">The authors extrapolation of knowledge that
      circumcision reduces the transmission rate of HIV within the
      unprotected population of developing countries, to a belief
      that this has a role within the European population, is I
      feel, irrelevant where barrier contraceptives are readily
      available and considerably more efficacious.</p>

      <p class="text2">Finally, there are now strong pressure
      groups (<a href="http://www.nocirc.org/"
      target="_blank">NOCIRC</a> and INTACT), largely in North
      America, protesting against the perceived assault of
      circumcision. Duckett estimates a million adult males in the
      US would pay significant fees for a preputial reconstruction
      when it is possible.<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

      <p class="text2">In countries where neonatal circumcision is
      rarely practiced, and appropriate non-aggressive management
      of the normal foreskin, with non-forcible retraction and
      regular cleaning after spontaneous relaxation of the
      physiological phimosis, there is no population demand for
      neonatal circumcision. This supports the conclusion that
      neonatal circumcision is a social ritual with a grain of
      medical origin, and aligns with the recent guidelines of the
      Canadian Paediatric Society, that `circumcision of newborns
      should not be routinely performed.'<sup><a
