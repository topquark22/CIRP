            <h2>Cutting edge argument on joy of sex</h2>

            <p class="1">A BRISBANE doctor under fire for
            performing the state's greatest number of circumcisions
            has defended the procedure, rejecting claims it leads
            to reduced sexual enjoyment.</p>

            <p class="2">Dr Terry Russell, whose MacGregor practice
            handles almost half of new-born circumcisions in the
            Brisbane area every year, has been reported to the <a
            href="http://www.medicalboard.qld.gov.au/"
            target="_blank">Queensland Medical Board</a> by a group
            of activists opposed to circumcision.</p>

            <p class="2">Statistics show Queensland tops the
            country with 21 per cent of all male infants undergoing
            the procedure, compared with a national average of 12.4
            per cent.</p>

            <p class="2">Members of anti-circumcision lobby group
            <a href="http://www.circinfo.org/"
            target="_blank">Circumcision Information Australia</a>
            claim the operation is a form of institutionalised
            sexual abuse with no proven medical advantage. CIA
            executive and Sydney pediatrician George Williams said
            the procedure instead affected a man's sexual enjoyment
            and caused long-term psychological damage in some
            cases.</p>

            <p class="2">He has written to the Queenland Medical
            Board asking it to investigate Dr Russell's burgeoning
            Brisbane practice, which he claims is partly
            responsible for Queensland's over representation in the
            statistics.</p>

            <p class="2">But Dr Russell, a GP who has been
            circumcising Australian infants for more than 30 years,
            said the procedure had proven health and hygiene
            benefits.</p>

            <p class="2">"Almost never do you see an uncircumcised
            penis that is not accumulating smegma, and old skin
            cells that act as a focus for infection," he said.</p>

            <p class="2">"The presence of smegma can also be a
            predisposition to cancer later in life.</p>

            <p class="2">"Ask any of your male friends who have
            been circumcised whether it has affected their sexual
            enjoyment and they will say no."</p>
