            <h2>Circumcision Attempt - Father sentenced to three
            years</h2>

            <p>Thursday, December 16, 2004<br />
            <b>By STEPHANIE RICE, Columbian staff writer</b></p>

            <p>Ridgefield father Edwin B. Baxter asked God for
            mercy and a judge for understanding Wednesday as he
            faced sentencing for an attempted circumcision on his
            8-year-old.</p>

            <p>Baxter said he was inspired to cut his son after
            reading Scripture and first consulted his wife.</p>

            <p>"It never has been my desire or intent to violate
            any laws," Baxter, 33, told <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/courts/superior/judges.html"
             target="_blank">Superior Court Judge James
            Rulli</a>.</p>

            <p>"I pray God will have mercy on me," Baxter said,
            choked up. He then put his head down on the table where
            he sat with his attorney.</p>

            <p>"Mr. Baxter, you must realize, as we all must
            realize, that there are consequences for our actions,"
            said Rulli, before sentencing Baxter to three years in
            prison.</p>

            <p>Baxter likely will appeal on the grounds that Rulli
            did not let him use his Christian fundamentalist faith
            as a defense, but Rulli cast doubt that argument will
            fly.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">"The court has steadfastly held
            that you can't jeopardize the health and safety of your
            family because of your religious beliefs,"</span> Rulli
            said.</p>

            <p>Baxter and his 30-year-old wife have nine children
            in their two-bedroom home. His wife, Tammy, is pregnant
            and due in February.</p>

            <p>On Sept. 3, Baxter called his son into the bathroom
            and had him lay in what witnesses described as a dirty
            bathtub. Baxter used a hunting knife to slice into his
            son's foreskin. He called 911 when his son began
            bleeding profusely.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Rulli said Baxter inflicted not
            only physical damage to his son, who received stitches,
            but probably also psychological damage.</span></p>

            <p>On Dec. 7, a jury convicted Baxter of assault of a
            child in the second degree.</p>

            <p>Before his trial, he rejected a plea deal that would
            have given him credit for the days he's spent in the
            Clark County Jail and had him released.</p>

            <p>According to state sentencing guidelines, Baxter
            faced between two years, seven months and three years,
            five months in prison. Rulli had no choice but to
            sentence him within that range.</p>

            <p>Rulli received letters from Baxter's friends who
            described Baxter as a thoughtful, honest person who
            "sometimes wrongly interpreted passages in the
            Bible."</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/pa/criminal/childabuse.html"
             target="_blank">Senior Deputy Prosecutor Kim Farr</a>
            said while Baxter may be a loving father who did not
            intend to harm his son, the attempted circumcision
            nevertheless was a criminal offense.</p>

            <p>Defense attorney Tony Lowe asked Rulli to set an
            appeal bond so Baxter could be released pending appeal
            and earn money for his family. Baxter's employer, the
            owner of Helser Bros. Transfer Co. in Portland, wrote a
            letter to Rulli.</p>

            <p>"Edwin is not a criminal," James Helser wrote. "He
            is guilty of using some extremely poor judgment and
            taking an action which he naively saw as a form of
            devotion and consecration to God. Edwin has already
            stated he has learned his lesson and would never again
            consider such a radical action. What he needs is some
            outpatient counseling, not incarceration."</p>

            <p>Rulli denied the request for the appeal bond,
            meaning Baxter will be sent to prison.</p>

            <p>Prior to his trial, Baxter was evaluated by a
            psychologist who concluded Baxter was competent to
            stand trial.</p>

            <p>The doctor noted Baxter did have "religious fervor
            that suggested mild delusional thinking," Lowe
            said.</p>

            <p>Lowe said Baxter would have had a doctor perform the
            circumcision but did not have the money.</p>

            <p>"It was sheer poverty that led him to do it
            himself," Lowe said.</p>

            <p>Baxter's father said his daughter-in-law and
            grandchildren are back in their Ridgefield home. After
            the incident, law enforcement and investigators from
            the state <a
            href="https://fortress.wa.gov/dshs/caoffices/internetapps/ca/display.asp?officeName=Vancouver%20DCFS"
             target="_blank">Department of Children and Family
            Services</a> tried without success to find the family.
            Baxter's father, Bruce, said his daughter-in-law has
            not, as a prosecutor said earlier, given birth in a van
            outside the family's property. He said four children
            have been born in a hospital, four were born in a house
            and one was born in a van that was en route to a
            hospital.</p>

            <p>He said the family has lived in <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/" target="_blank">Clark
            County</a> for four or five years.</p>

            <p>Farr said the family came to Clark County from Idaho
            after they were contacted by child welfare
            authorities.</p>
