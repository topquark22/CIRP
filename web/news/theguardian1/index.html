      <h2>Botched circumcision kills boys</h2>
      <b>Chris McGreal in Johannesburg</b> 

      <p>Four boys have died and about 100 have been admitted to
      hospital after botched circumcision ceremonies in south
      Africa.</p>

      <p>Doctors have blamed "traditional surgeons" who use the
      same blade to circumcise dozens of teenage boys at a time as
      part of ancient Xhosa rites of passage in Transkei.</p>

      <p>The children either bled to death or died from infections.
      Some of those in hospital are in a critical condition.</p>

      <p>Initiates have also complained of traditional surgeons who
      are drunk or high on cannabis during the cutting ceremony.
      Health workers have long warned against traditional methods
      of circumcision, in part because repeated use of the same
      blade will spread Aids and hepatitis.</p>

      <p>Infections are also caused when bandages used to control
      bleeding are tied too tight.</p>

      <p>The health ministry has threatened to prosecute
      traditional surgeons who fail to maintain good hygiene but
      with little effect.</p>

      <p>Ten boys died during similar ceremonies in the middle of
      last year. Families typically pay 200 Rand (&pound; 20) for a
      traditional surgeon and attendants at the ceremony. Most
      Xhosa are too poor to pay for a hospital circumcision.</p>

      <p>Traditional leaders in parts of the Eastern Cape are
      hoping a tiny clamp imported from Malaysia will put an end to
      deaths and infections.</p>

      <p>The "<a href="/library/procedure/tara-klamp/">Tara
      Klamp</a>" does the cutting and then protects the wound ,
      eliminating bandages. And it is used once, eliminating
      transmitted diseases.</p>
