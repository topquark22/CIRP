      <i>What do you do when your doctor tells you your son should be
      circumcised?<br />
      Sophie Radice agonises over the choices.<br />
      Sunday May 28, 2000.</i>

      <p>One terrible evening last year, my eight-year-old son's
      foreskin got stuck back at bathtime when he was routinely
      cleaning himself. Within minutes, it had alarmingly ballooned
      behind a tight red ring of swollen skin and he was screaming
      with pain. My husband was still at work and I suddenly felt
      desperately inadequate. What should I do? Perhaps there was a
      knack to this? Was this something that happened to boys that
      I didn't know about?</p>

      <p>I phoned my GP, who told me that this was an emergency and
      to get to hospital immediately. My son then had to endure an
      hour of agony which overcame his extreme embarrassment at
      having to hold an ice-pack on his genitals while dozens of
      medical staff came in to our cubicle and gave their opinion.
      When that failed to bring down the swelling, he was given
      morphine, followed by gas and air, while a consultant tried
      to manipulate his foreskin back into its usual position.
      Despite being told that we were very lucky that the 'foreskin
      expert' just happened to be in the hospital and this
      consultant had 'never encountered one that he could not get
      back', in the end my son was put under general anaesthetic to
      drain the fluid by a small incision. I was told that he had a
      bad attack of balanitis - inflammation of the foreskin -
      which is why he was complaining of having a sore willy. When
      he tried to clean it in the bath by pulling back his
      foreskin, paraphimosis occurred. This is when the retracted
      circle of foreskin becomes tight and swollen, and then fluid
      builds up behind the tight ring of skin.</p>

      <p>Before he went into the operating theatre I was told that
      'he would certainly have to be circumcised at some point and
      did I want it done now so he would not need another
      operation?' Even though I was warned that the swelling would
      make it slightly more tricky, my immediate response was:
      'Yes, of course.' I should explain that there is a history of
      tight foreskins in my family, with one case of circumcision
      in late childhood. More importantly, I never wanted my son to
      have to endure this kind of agony again. The consultant
      added, 'If you had seen as many old men with their foreskins
      stuck back, as I have, then you'd have no doubts.'</p>

      <p>Before signing the consent form, I hesitated just for a
      moment, however. My son had already gone under the
      anaesthetic, and standing next to his unconscious form, I
      suddenly felt that it would be terribly wrong to make this
      decision on his behalf. I needed to discuss it with him, my
      husband, my son's father, my doctor and, as it turned out,
      anyone who could give me an opinion, be it cultural,
      emotional, sexual or medical.</p>

      <p>In the months that followed, I tried to get as much
      information as possible by raising what I discovered was the
      highly emotional and pun-ridden ('Let's get straight to the
      point,' said the urologist; and 'You must read this seminal
      work') subject of circumcision as often as I could. Both my
      uncircumcised husband and ex-husband were horrified that I
      had even considered agreeing to the operation. Meanwhile, my
      doctor prescribed an antibiotic cream to apply at the
      slightest sign of swelling and told us to take our time
      making up our minds.</p>

      <p>Jewish friends and a Muslim relative felt that my son's
      medical problems added weight to the cultural reasons for
      having their sons circumcised as babies. Religious
      circumcision may have its origins in ancient Egypt of 3000
      BC. It was adopted by the Jews and later the Muslims,
      possibly as a hygienic measure in a hot and sandy climate. It
      then became a ritual of religious observance.</p>

      <p>Dr Schamroth of the Association of Progressive Mohalim,
      who performs circumcision on both Jewish and Muslim babies,
      says that 'it is not a nice thing to have to do to a newborn.
      As a doctor, I feel that there are no medical disadvantages
      in later life, though I don't feel there is overwhelming
      evidence of advantages either. My concern is to make it as
      untraumatic as possible, with local anaesthetic.'</p>

      <p>Talking to friends in mixed marriages with sons was also
      helpful because of the lengthy debates they had inevitably
      had during pregnancy. Sandra Rose is married to Paul, with a
      son aged three and a two-month-old daughter. He is Jewish and
      she was brought up in a non-religious family of Christian
      origin. 'The thought of any kind of operation removing
      healthy tissue was extremely difficult to get my head
      around,' she said. 'When Daniel was born, we spent three days
      arguing about it, and in the end I found my husband's
      religious and emotional reasons - he wanted a son that
      resembled him and his forefathers - more compelling than my
      squeamishness. In the event, the circumcision, when Daniel
      was eight days old, was a deeply moving family event, and
      Daniel didn't even cry.'</p>

      <p>The circumcision debate is not only between non-Jews and
      Jews and Muslims but international, intergenerational and in
      the case of my bother-in-law from Guyana - where only men of
      certain ancestry use circumcision as a mark - intertribal.
      British men of my grandfather's and father's generation were
      routinely circumcised at only a few days old. It is likely
      that circumcision was introduced in this country by doctors
      who felt that it would discourage masturbation, which was
      considered to be the cause of a number of illnesses,
      including epilepsy and blindness. This attitude prevailed
      until 1935, when the aptly named Dr Cockshut wrote in the
      British Medical Journal : 'I am convinced that masturbation
      is much less common in the circumcised - with these
      considerations in view, it does not seem apt to argue that
      "God knows best how to make little boys".' Circumcision later
      came to be considered more 'civilised' in that it was a sign
      of a hospital birth, and possibly because during both World
      Wars and the era of National Service, circumcised conscripts
      suffered from fewer infections if hygiene was poor.</p>

      <p>In America, there is now a radical anti-circumcision
      movement in response to a 60 per cent circumcision rate,
      which has gone down from nearly 90 per cent. There is also a
      small movement of American men who attempt to 'grow back'
      their foreskin by means of bands and weights. In the UK,
      there is little call for extreme pro- or anti-circumcision
      groups because a number of factors brought down the rate of
      circumcision to today's 10 per cent. A highly influential
      paper, '<a href="/library/general/gairdner/">The Fate of the
      Foreskin</a>', was written in 1949 by a Dr Gairdner, stating
      that most boys' foreskins retract naturally by the age of
      four or five and the rest by adolescence. Also, mothers
      started to question the practice at the same time as the NHS
      (where money was always tight) was born and sexual attitudes
      (masturbation no longer being considered the root of all
      evil) became more relaxed.</p>

      <p>At its most atavistic level, the debate can get nasty.
      Uncircumcised and circumcised men defend their own penile
      state. The circumcised are confident that they are smegma
      free, more aesthetically pleasing, free from cancer of the
      penis, urinary tract infections, premature ejaculation (I
      have even heard a circumcised man say that he has a bigger
      erection because there is no skin holding him back) and are
      better lovers. The uncircumcised feel they are more sensitive
      because the foreskin protects the glans, that women find them
      easier to 'handle' without lubrication. They, too, consider
      themselves to be better lovers.</p>

      <p>Mr Cuckow, consultant paediatrician urologist at London's
      Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, says that 'men can
      be far too concerned with either wanting a circumcision, or
      regretting one, or in the defending of non-circumcision in
      the context of the sexual performance. There is such a wide
      spectrum of normality when it comes to the penis, and sex
      involves such a huge range of stimuli and sensation, which
      are not all centred on the tip of the penis.'</p>

      <p>Although an important consideration, my son's future sex
      life is not the only thing I have to think about here. Above
      all, I don't want him to have to endure repeated discomfort
      or emergency dashes to the hospital. Cuckow is reassuring.
      'At the end of the day, the foreskin is a normal piece of
      tissue which is not pathological, but like any part of the
      body, it does need some looking after. Be vigilant about
      gentle washing and tell your son to retract his foreskin a
      little when he does a pee.'</p>

      <p>In a quiet moment, I gently told my son some of the things
      I had learned and asked what he thought. I was surprised to
      hear that although he wasn't that keen on the operation, he
      would have it done if he could go back to the same hospital -
      'because they had the best Nintendo 64 game console that I
      have ever seen. That's a good enough reason, isn't it?' The
      decision is on hold.</p>

      <h3>Circumcision: the facts</h3>

      <p><b>The foreskin</b> In most boys, the foreskin (also
      called a prepuce) is attached to the head of the penis at
      birth. It keeps the glans soft, moist and sensitive and
      protects it from exposure and chaffing. During growth and
      development, the foreskin gradually separates from the head
      of the penis or glans and it is extremely inadvisable to pull
      it back forcibly, as unenlightened paediatricians used to do.
      Consultant Mr Wilcox of the paediatric urology department of
      Guy's hospital says that this 'may cause tears and scar
      tissue, which will mean problems in retracting the foreskin
      later on'.</p>

      <p><b>Problems</b> These three conditions are the most common
      reasons for medical circumcision but many doctors, urologists
      and paediatricians would now consider other treatments such
      as antibiotic and steroid creams as well as gentle and
      extremely gradual stretching exercises.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Phimosis, or tight foreskin: a condition in which the
        foreskin cannot be drawn back. It may cause the foreskin to
        balloon out on urination, which may in turn cause urinary
        tract complications.</li>

        <li>Paraphimosis: a condition in which the foreskin, having
        been retracted, is too tight to re-cover the glans. The
        trapped foreskin then causes the glans to swell and fill
        with fluid.</li>

        <li>Balanitis: inflammation of the foreskin or glans. It
        may be caused by irritants such as soap, a build-up of
        smegma (natural waxy cream-coloured substance under the
        foreskin), or friction.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Hygiene</b> One of the reasons many paediatric urologists
      think that boys have problems with their foreskins is that
      parents, and particularly mothers, are unwilling or
      embarrassed to teach boys how to properly clean themselves.
      In the bath, boys from the age of four or five should be
      taught to very gently pull back the foreskin a small way and
      clean as much of the glans and foreskin as they can. As they
      get older, they will be able to pull the foreskin back
      further so they can wash away urine and smegma. If the
      foreskin does get stuck back, then try to firmly pull it back
      into its normal position as soon as possible because any
      delay increases the chance of swelling. If this is
      impossible, then get to hospital as quickly as you can.

      <p><b>Circumcision</b> Circumcision is the surgical removal
      of the sleeve of skin and mucosal tissue that normally covers
      the head of the penis. In very repeated cases of infection,
      medical circumcision may be seriously considered. It is
      worthwhile getting a second or third opinion from other
      urologists. In most medical circumcisions, which commonly
      occur in mid- to late childhood, a general anaesthetic is
      used, but with infants, a local anaesthetic cream or
      injection can provide a penile nerve block. Some doctors and
      all Orthodox Jewish mohels (the men who perform the task)
      prefer to avoid the small risks posed by anaesthetic agents.
      There is a good deal of controversy about how much the baby
      is traumatised by circumcision.</p>

      <p><b>Timing</b> If your child must be circumcised, think
      carefully about the timing. Penelope Leach recommends that
      parents wait until the boy is more than six: 'The younger
      they are, the more difficult it is for them to understand
      that removing the foreskin will not damage the organ.' If the
      boy is prepubescent or adolescent and self-conscious, he may
      find the whole process deeply embarrassing and humiliating.
      Circumcision is a minor operation, but it can be extremely
      upsetting.</p>

      <p><b>Recovery</b> Older boys may find the few days after
      circumcision extremely painful. There are many ways to help
      keep the pressure off, such as using a sports box or sitting
      on a beanbag.</p>
