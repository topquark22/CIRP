            <h2>Is Ritual Circumcision Religious Expression?</h2>

            <p><b>By JEFFREY ROSEN</b><br />
             <small>Published: February 5, 2006</small></p>

            <p>Americans pride themselves on their commitment to
            freedom of religion, but how much religious freedom is
            too much religious freedom? At the moment, the
            thorniest dispute over the issue concerns a
            male-circumcision ritual practiced by some Hasidic Jews
            in New York. The ritual is called oral suction, or
            <i>metzitzah b'peh</i>. After removing the foreskin, <a
            href="http://www.sexuallymutilatedchild.org/mohel.htm"
            target="_blank">the mohel, who conducts the
            circumcision, cleans the wound by sucking blood from
            it.</a> According to city health officials, the ritual
            may have caused three infants circumcised by the same
            mohel in 2003 and 2004 to contract neonatal herpes (one
            of the infants subsequently died). New York's city
            health commissioner recently issued a warning about the
            dangers of oral suction, leading some Orthodox Jewish
            leaders to complain that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had
            reneged on promises to let religious authorities handle
            the issue. Meanwhile, secularists like the writer
            Christopher Hitchens have attacked the mayor for
            banning smoking in restaurants while failing to protect
            helpless children from diseases transmitted by
            "religious fanatics."</p>

            <p>Among other things, the rabbis fear that
            restrictions on <i>metzitzah b'peh</i> might lead to
            bans on male circumcision itself. And these fears
            aren't entirely unfounded. <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/1999.11.26_Guardian/"
            target="_blank">In 1999, a British family court blocked
            a religious circumcision of a 5-year-old boy on the
            grounds that it wasn't in the best interest of the
            child</a>. The rabbis fear that once courts feel
            emboldened to make their own judgments about whether
            circumcisions are medically beneficial or harmful, the
            United States could go the way of the British
            court.</p>

            <p>There are, after all, individuals and advocacy
            groups in America who oppose male circumcision on
            principle and could use the courts to their advantage.
            In 1997, a North Dakota mother whose son had been
            circumcised over her objection with his father's
            consent argued in federal court that North Dakota's ban
            on female genital mutilation &mdash; which some Muslims
            believe is compelled by the Koran &mdash; was
            unconstitutional. Because the state protected girls but
            not boys from a harmful and medically unnecessary
            procedure, the mother argued, it failed to treat boys
            and girls equally. Either both forms of circumcision
            had to be banned or both had to be allowed. Although
            the suit was dismissed, it points toward an
            aggressively secularist system, as in France, where
            inflexible visions of equality are used to curtail
            traditional religious practices.</p>

            <p>America, with its longstanding tradition of
            accommodating minority religious practices, has chosen
            an alternative model, more consistent with the demands
            of a multicultural democracy. The harms of female
            circumcision are more obvious than those posed by the
            oral suction procedure in male circumcision, which no
            state has yet regulated. (There are 2,000 to 4,000 of
            these circumcisions performed each year in New York
            City, and no more than seven recorded cases of herpes.)
            U.S. judges and politicians should defer to religious
            authorities in the cases where reasonable people can
            disagree about the health risks.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, the American compromise depends on a
            delicate series of judgments about when, precisely,
            private religious expression imposes harms on
            unconsenting and innocent third parties. Courts have
            held that Jehovah's Witnesses may not deprive their
            children of blood transfusions. But should the city of
            Newark be able to prohibit all police officers &mdash;
            including practicing Muslims &mdash; from wearing
            beards in order to foster a uniform appearance on the
            job? In a 1999 ruling, Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. sided
            with the Muslim officers. Since Newark allowed police
            officers not to shave for medical reasons (typically if
            they had a skin condition), Alito said that it was
            discriminatory not to make an exception for those whose
            religion required them to wear beards. Alito stressed,
            however, that states can refuse to accommodate
            religious minorities in the interest of promoting
            public health, as long as they treat religious and
            secular citizens equally.</p>

            <p>This Solomonic ruling makes sense, as far as it
            goes, but it doesn't tell us how deferential Alito will
            be to religious practices in other cases. The most
            prominent American conservative scholar of religious
            liberty, Judge Michael McConnell, agrees that
            noncoercive religious expressions, like yarmulkes worn
            by Jewish soldiers, should be accommodated. But he
            emphasizes that public prayer in schools, which coerces
            nonbelievers to pray, should be banned. By contrast,
            Justice Antonin Scalia, who generally opposes religious
            accommodations, supports prayer in schools because he
            says that the state needn't be neutral between religion
            and secularism. Let's hope that Justice Alito, whatever
            his views on Orthodox circumcision rituals, doesn't go
            that far. The beards of Muslim police officers should
            indeed be protected, but not as a cautious first step
            toward the goal of creating an openly religious
            state.</p>
