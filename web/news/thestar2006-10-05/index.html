          <h2>Scores of initiates died in E Cape, hearing told</h2>

          <p>October 05, 2006 <i>Edition 2</i></p>

          <p>Traditional circumcision rites have killed 83
          initiates in the Eastern Cape alone between 1996 and
          2005, public hearings into initiation schools have been
          told.</p>

          <p>There had been 19 more deaths in the province this
          year. Another 63 initiates had to undergo amputations,
          while 562 were hospitalised, Eastern Cape Health
          Department officials said on the second day of the
          hearings in Lusikisiki yesterday.</p>

          <p>"These are shocking statistics," said Mongezi Guma,
          chairperson of the commission for the promotion and
          protection of the rights of cultural, religious and
          linguistic communities (<a
          href="http://www.crlcommission.org.za/"
          target="_blank">CRL Commission</a>).</p>

          <p>"We hope that at the end of this process an integrated
          system of accountability will be developed," said Guma,
          who also chaired the panel.</p>

          <p>It heard that most of the deaths were in Pondoland,
          and most were caused by meningitis, physical abuse,
          hunger, dehydration, pneumonia, septicaemia and
          neglect.</p>

          <p>"This is happening despite the fact that the
          provincial Health Department has dedicated more than 60
          health officers to monitor the implementation of this
          cultural practice," the CRL Commission, <a
          href="http://www.sahrc.org.za/sahrc_cms/publish/cat_index_26.shtml"
           target="_blank">SA Human Rights Commission</a> and
          National House of Traditional Leaders said in a joint
          statement.</p>

          <p>Some delegates were asking why the Health Department
          was handling the practice when traditional leaders and
          the Culture and Heritage Department were "directly
          concerned with practices including initiation and
          circumcision". - Sapa</p>
