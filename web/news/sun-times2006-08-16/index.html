            <p>A Chicago couple filed suit Tuesday against <a
            href="http://www.nmh.org/nmh/home.htm"
            target="_blank">Northwestern Memorial Hospital</a> and
            five doctors involved in their son's birth, saying
            negligence cost the boy a testicle. The couple said the
            doctors failed to perform "an appropriate physical
            examination" before circumcising the boy. Their failure
            to properly diagnose a series of conditions --
            including testicular torsion and having a buried penis
            -- was coupled by the doctors' "failure to disclose the
            risks and benefits of circumcision" before it was done.
            The boy, now 2, had his right testicle destroyed during
            the procedure and it's now removed, according to the
            suit.</p>

            <p>The boy, Liam Barton, was born to Eric and Nicole
            Barton on Aug. 15, 2004, at Northwestern Memorial
            Hospital, the suit said. The couple never asked doctors
            to perform a circumcision on Liam.</p>
