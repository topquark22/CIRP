        <h2>Agreement reached in circumcision case</h2>
      </center>

      <p><b>WICHITA, Tuesday, July 24.</b> A settlement between an
      18-day-old baby's parents, whose disagreement over whether to
      circumcise their son almost ended up in court, was reached
      today, the boy's father said. A settlement between an
      18-day-old baby's parents, whose disagreement over whether to
      circumcise their son almost ended up in court, was reached
      today, the boy's father said.</p>

      <p>includes a provision that the baby, Asher Nathaniel
      Grisham, will not be circumcised, Rodney Grisham said.</p>

      <p>wouldn't agree to anything less," he said. "Nobody is
      doing that to my son."</p>

      <p>dispute between Rodney and Sheila Grisham, who are in the
      process of divorcing, began before the baby was born.</p>

      <p>Rodney Grisham, 25, said circumcision amounts to sexual
      assault. Sheila Grisham, 21, argued not doing it was against
      her religious beliefs.</p>

      <p>Rodney Grisham went so far as to file a protection from
      abuse order at the <a
      href="http://distcrt18.state.ks.us/">Sedgwick County
      courthouse</a> in the name of his son to stop the
      procedure.</p>
