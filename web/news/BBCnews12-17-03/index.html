            <h4>Malaysia is to consider using mass circumcision
            ceremonies to promote racial harmony.</h4>

            <p>Circumcision is a rite of passage for young Muslim
            boys, and in Malaysia it is common for the ceremony to
            become an event with dozens, or even hundreds of boys
            being circumcised together.</p>

            <p>Now the prime minister's religious affairs adviser
            has suggested that circumcision can bring Malaysians of
            all races and religions together.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://pkukmweb.ukm.my/~kimia/SKimia/A_StafAkad/aho.html"
             target="blank">Dr Abdul Hamid Othman</a> said that
            with the growing popularity of circumcision among the
            country's non-Muslim minorities - who see it as good
            hygienic practice - they too could be invited to join
            in the celebrations with their Muslim friends.</p>

            <p>He believes the idea could promote better race
            relations and he wants to see a nationwide circumcision
            ceremony organised.</p>

            <p>Just over half of Malaysia's population is Muslim,
            mainly members of the ethnic Malay community, while the
            country's Chinese, Tamil and tribal peoples follow a
            variety of other faiths.</p>

            <p>The <a
            href="http://www.pmo.gov.my/website/webdb.nsf/?Opendatabase"
             target="_blank">government</a> has been exploring ways
            of stopping the different groups from drifting apart,
            including the introduction of a national service scheme
            which begins in February.</p>
