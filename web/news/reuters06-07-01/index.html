      <h2>Jews protest Swedish circumcision restriction</h2>

      <p>NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - A leading Jewish group
      accused Sweden on Thursday of placing the first legal
      restriction on Jewish religious practice in Europe since the
      Nazi era with a law that affects how circumcisions are
      carried out in that country.</p>

      <p>The New York-based <a href="http://www.wjc.org.il/"
      target="_blank">World Jewish Congress</a> said that it is
      receiving many complaints from European members about a law
      passed by the Swedish parliament on June 1 that said
      circumcisions can only be performed after the administering
      of an analgesic by a doctor, nurse or person with special
      permit.</p>

      <p>The law was passed after a circumcision led to the death
      of a Muslim boy. Both Jews and Muslims practice circumcision
      for religious reasons with Jews performing the rite when the
      child is eight days old and Muslims when they are
      considerably older.</p>

      <p>About 3,000 boys a year of both religions are circumcised
      in Sweden, the WJC said.</p>

      <p>A WJC spokesman said, "This is the first legal restriction
      placed on a Jewish rite in Europe since the Nazi era. This
      new legislation is totally unacceptable to the Swedish Jewish
      community." the Swedish Jewish community numbers about
      18,500.</p>

      <p>Jewish circumcisions are performed by a religious official
      in a religious ceremony.</p>

      <p>The WJC spokesman added he expected that the issue would
      be discussed when the Swedish prime minister visits Israel
      over the weekend. The law is to take effect on Oct. 1.</p>
