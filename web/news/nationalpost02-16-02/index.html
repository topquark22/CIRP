      <h2>Parents charged in circumcision of daughter remain in
      custody<br />
      11-year-old girl</h2>

      <p><b>Anne Marie Owens</b><br />
       National Post</p>

      <p>An Ontario couple charged with having their 11-year-old
      daughter circumcised in their home are being held in custody
      while the court determines whether they should go free.</p>

      <p>The court case may provide rare evidence the surgical
      procedure, which is illegal in Canada under laws on <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/female/">female genital
      mutilation</a> but is still widely practised in some parts of
      Africa and the Middle East, is being conducted in Canada.</p>

      <p>The identities of the parents, who live in St. Catharines,
      Ont., are not being released to protect the identity of the
      girl, now 13.</p>

      <p>The mother, 42, and father, 47, are very distressed by the
      charges, said their lawyer, Keith Newell.</p>

      <p>Police will not reveal the religious or cultural
      background of the family, since such specific information
      could possibly identify the girl in a community with as small
      a multi-cultural population as St. Catharines.</p>

      <p>But the circumstances about this case are not surprising
      to those who work with immigrants from countries that favour
      female circumcision as a rite of passage for young women.</p>

      <p>"I feel so bad that this catastrophe would happen, because
      we could have prevented this," said Nadia Badr, founder of
      the Sudanese Women Association of Niagara.</p>

      <p>She attempted to hold workshops and seminars over the past
      few years to educate women in her community about the risks
      of these procedures, but was stopped by a lack of
      funding.</p>

      <p>"It is not a surprise to me that this would happen," she
      said. "Culturally, fathers and mothers think it's a good
      thing for their girls.... The parents have no idea it's
      wrong. They think it's protection for their daughter. That's
      why they're keen to do it, no matter what the cost."</p>

      <p>She said she has heard of these circumcisions taking place
      underground, and suggests the practitioner involved in this
      case will likely be a woman from the family's ethnic
      community who learned in their homeland how to perform the
      surgery.</p>

      <p>Malika Mounir, a settlement worker with the Multicultural
      Centre in St. Catharines, says it has been difficult to
      address the issue of female circumcision in a women's group
      for new immigrants because they are very reticent to talk
      about it.</p>

      <p>"This doesn't surprise me because some of these people
      don't even know that it is illegal in Canada," she said. "We
      know that this goes on underground. This is something that a
      lot of these parents don't know they cannot do. They don't
      realize they can go to jail."</p>

      <p>In this case, the parents are charged with aggravated
      assault for their role in arranging the surgical
      procedure.</p>

      <p>Detective Sergeant James Mackay, head of the child abuse
      unit with the <a
      href="http://www.vaxxine.com/nrpsweb/">Niagara Regional
      Police</a>, said investigators are still trying to identify
      the practitioner responsible for the surgery.</p>

      <p>The girl's parents appeared briefly in a St. Catharines
      courtroom yesterday, but their bail hearing was postponed
      until Monday.</p>

      <p>The father has also been charged with assault with a
      weapon, for allegedly hitting the girl on the back with a
      belt several times over the past few years.</p>

      <p>The charges stem from a two-month investigation by the
      child-abuse unit and the social-welfare agency in
      Niagara.</p>
