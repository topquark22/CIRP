            <p><span class="yellow">Recent studies have shown no
            evidence that male circumcision lessened the spread of
            HIV, a leading expert on the disease says.</span></p>

            <p>Director of the UNAIDS Regional Support Team for
            Asia and the Pacific, J.V.R. Prasada Rao expressed
            scepticism about the popular belief, which if
            confirmed, could help prevent the disease in men.</p>

            <p>Circumcision has been shown to work &mdash; there is
            evidence that sometimes it lessens HIV transmission.
            "However, the practice [as a preventive measure] is
            dangerous to advocate because it is not 100 per cent
            fool-proof," Mr Rao told <i>Treat Asia</i>, a journal
            which focuses on HIV-Aids in Asia. But many Aids
            researchers, like French expert Bertran Auvert, have
            come to the conclusion after extensive studies that
            male circumcision would reduce the risk of
            female-to-male transmission by 50 to 60 per cent.</p>

            <p>In 2007, the World Health Organisation and UNAIDS
            recommended that male circumcision be recognised as an
            effectual preventive measure. "Male circumcision must
            be recognised as an important means to fight the spread
            of HIV infection and the international community must
            mobilise to promote it," Mr Auvert strongly emphasised
            at a presentation; his 2005 study involving at least
            3,000 African men is believed to be one of the most
            extensive yet.</p>

            <p>HIV is a virus that leads to Aids, which primarily
            attacks the body's immune system causing it to
            gradually fail. This leads to increased susceptibility
            to otherwise common infections such as influenza which
            can become life-threatening.</p>

            <p>There is currently no cure for the virus, frequently
            transmitted through the transfer of bodily fluids such
            as blood, semen, vaginal fluid and breast milk.</p>

            <p>International health organisations estimate Aids has
            claimed more than 25 million people since it was first
            identified in 1981 and it is believed to be one of the
            worst pandemics in history. Regions such as Africa and
            South East Asia are known to be the worst affected,
            making up more than half of the world?s infected
            population.</p>

            <p>Mr Rao noted that although most Asian nations had
            stepped up preventive measures such as condom promotion
            programmes, the disease was still spreading rapidly.
            Transmission among vulnerable groups ? sex workers,
            intravenous drug users (IDU) and men who have sex with
            men (MSM) ? was particularly rapid, he said.</p>

            <p>Preventative methods only reached less than 20 per
            cent of these target populations especially in areas
            such as Thailand and Cambodia, Mr Rao added.</p>

            <p>Different societal cultures also has to be taken
            into account when implementing such measures ?
            especially predominantly Islamic states such as
            Malaysia as the religion traditionally prohibits birth
            control.</p>

            <p>He highlighted that a great deal of money has been
            spent on awareness programmes which have not created an
            adequate impact.</p>

            <p>The important part is to have political will, and
            also to have adequate resources for a larger scale
            campaign [if we are to reach at least an 80 per cent
            coverage].</p>

            <p>But there is a mismatch in the allocation of
            budgets. This needs to be corrected if we really want
            to have effective prevention strategies,? he
            explained.</p>

            <p>Currently, an estimated 40 million HIV-positive
            patients face a major issue of costly second-line
            anti-retrovirals ? medicine which slows down the damage
            of the virus on the immune system thus prolonging a
            patient?s lifespan.</p>

            <p>Generics [second-generation medication] are
            available in countries such as India but still at a
            high cost. I think governments just need to come up
            with different strategies to contain costs, such as
            using compulsory licenses or parallel importing,
            available under World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms. I
            think countries should look at the WTO flexibilities to
            make second-line anti-retrovirals available,? Mr Rao
            suggested.</p>

            <p>Without anti-retrovirals, HIV patients have been
            known to develop Aids within eight to 11 years - it
            varies from individuals. Once diagnosed with Aids, the
            average Aids patient has been said to live up to nine
            months.</p>

            <p>But perhaps the worst symptom of the disease is the
            stigma it carries due to the medium of which the
            disease is usually passed through &mdash; via sexual
            intercourse or drug use.</p>

            <p>Vietnamese victim Jeanne D'Arc Truong is an example
            of a disturbing trend of individuals afraid to disclose
            their status as HIV positive. She told Treat Asia she
            learnt that her boyfriend had infected her in 2000
            after a blood test.</p>

            <p>When my results came back positive, I confronted my
            boyfriend. It made him miserable to feel like the
            culprit who signed my death sentence. In 2001, he
            died.</p>

            <p>I disclosed my status to no one except my mother and
            I knew that the only way out was share my story, but it
            was difficult to be open about HIV. When I told my
            closest friend, she seemed sympathetic but later
            confessed her fear of coming into close contact with me
            or drink from the first glass,? the program officer of
            the USAID/Health policy Initiative in Vietnam
            confessed.</p>

            <p>The WHO and UNAIDS have stated the biggest concerns
            now are these people, who are unwilling to disclose
            their statuses to their sexual contacts, knowingly
            infecting thousands more every year.</p>

            <p>Countries such as diverse as Singapore, Russia and
            the United Kingdom have seen no other way out but to
            enact laws to prosecute HIV carriers who knowingly pass
            the virus on to others in a bid to stem the
            problem.</p>

            <p>But experts say that such persecutions undermine
            efforts to stop the spread of the disease.</p>

            <p>Deborah Jack, chief executive of the <a
            href="http://www.nat.org.uk/" target="_blank">National
            Aids Trust</a> in Edinburgh says: Stigma and
            discrimination around HIV is increasing as people
            living with HIV are cast as criminals, making it even
            more difficult for them to tell other people.</p>

            <p>Prosecutions are undermining our efforts to
            encourage people to take responsibility for their own
            sexual health by implying it is the sole responsibility
            of the person living with HIV to have safer sex.</p>
