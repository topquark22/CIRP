            <p>David Reimer was the victim of an experiment gone
            totally awry &#8212; an experiment that suggested
            nurture could trump nature.</p>

            <p>The 38-year-old Winnipeg man, who was born a boy but
            raised as a girl after a botched circumcision, took his
            own life last week.</p>

            <p>But for some, his death and his life will not be in
            vain.</p>

            <p>Reimer's tortured experience as a girl leaves a
            lasting legacy in the field of gender identity and the
            debate over what shapes a human being: nature or
            nurture.</p>

            <p>"David was a hero," said Milton Diamond, a
            psychologist at the University of Hawaii, at the John
            A. Burns School of Medicine in Honolulu, who was
            involved in Reimer's case.</p>

            <p>"David didn't give permission for what was done to
            him. Even though he didn't have a penis, he still knew
            he was male," Diamond said.</p>

            <p>Thanks to Reimer, many psychiatrists and
            psychologists have had to rethink their theories on
            what determines sex, says Ken Zucker,
            psychologist-in-chief at Toronto's Centre for Addiction
            and Mental Health and a specialist in gender
            identity.</p>

            <p>Reimer's life story was described in a 2000 book by
            New York-based writer John Colapinto, <i>As Nature Made
            Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl.</i> His story
            was also featured on <i>Oprah.</i></p>

            <p>In the early 1970s, one theory held that gender was
            flexible and a child could be taught to be a man or a
            woman. "The (Reimer) case has taught a lot of people in
            the field that things are a lot more complex when it
            comes to gender than people originally thought 30 years
            ago," said Zucker.</p>

            <p>"Where we've really had a lot of advances is in
            recognizing biology has a predisposing influence on
            gender identity and gender roles.</p>

            <p>"But the environment is also important."</p>

            <p>After a botched circumcision led to the removal of
            his penis, Reimer was renamed Brenda and raised as a
            girl, later receiving female hormones.</p>

            <p>His parents were following the advice of
            psychologist Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University
            in Baltimore.</p>

            <p>Positive reports in medical journals suggested
            Reimer was adapting successfully to his new gender as a
            girl.</p>

            <p>Many, from feminists to learning theorists, embraced
            the case, using it as an example that gender could
            indeed be taught.</p>

            <p>But nothing was further from the truth in this case,
            said Dr. Keith Sigmundson who was a supervising
            psychiatrist for Reimer from when he was 8 to 20 years
            old. Reimer didn't adjust well to being a girl at all
            and began having difficulties at school.</p>

            <p>"By the time Reimer was 11, the whole experiment was
            falling apart," said Sigmundson, who was brought into
            the case by the Winnipeg school system. Reimer was
            eventually told when he was 13 that he had been born a
            boy. He rebelled and went back to being a boy.</p>

            <p>"From that point on he sought out all the surgery,"
            said Sigmundson.</p>

            <p>"He totally changed how he was presenting himself
            and struggled with a number of operations. He
            eventually lived his life as a man."</p>

            <p>Reimer got a job in a meat-packing plant in
            Winnipeg. He married and was a stepfather to three
            children.</p>

            <p>Up until about a year ago, he was in "top form,"
            said Sigmundson who remained in contact with him.</p>

            <p>But Reimer felt responsible for the suicide of his
            twin brother two years ago, the psychiatrist said.</p>

            <p>Then he slumped into even more of a depression after
            losing his job and separating from his wife.</p>

            <p>His mother, Janet Reimer, told Canadian Press that
            she believes her son would still be alive had it not
            been for the devastating gender study. "I think he felt
            he had no options. It just kept building up and
            building up."</p>

            <p>Many of the changes in the way social scientists,
            psychologists and psychiatrists think about gender has
            happened because of Reimer and the controversy
            surrounding his life.</p>

            <p>"At the time, there was a major controversy in our
            society over whether an individual's personality and
            their adaptation of their gender was a result of how
            they were born versus how they were raised," explained
            Sigmundson. The only one thing that is clear today is
            gender is a combination of many factors, including
            biology and learning, he noted.</p>

            <p>"There are certain immutable things that happen in
            your chromosomes and in utero that develop the gonads
            that have an impact on your brain which set the pattern
            for the rest of your life," he said. "That's
            essentially what we know now."</p>

            <p>Sigmundson and Diamond were responsible for
            revealing publicly that Money's experiment had failed
            and all was not well with Reimer's new gender. They
            published a report in 1997 in the <i>Archives of
            Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine</i> that outlined
            Reimer's rejection of being a girl.</p>

            <p>"His life was very difficult," said Diamond, crying
            as he spoke to a reporter. "And I think the legacy is
            the whole issue of how people identify and see
            themselves as male and female. It's not as simplistic
            as putting people into blue rooms and pink rooms.
            Certainly our environment makes a difference and how
            we're brought up makes a difference. But we come to the
            game with our own inherent natures and how those things
            interplay can't be predicted."<br />
