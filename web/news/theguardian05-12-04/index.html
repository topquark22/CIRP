            <p class="2">They were meant to show that gender was
            determined by nurture, not nature - one identical twin
            raised as a boy and the other brought up as a girl
            after a botched circumcision. But two years ago Brian
            Reimer killed himself, and last week David - formerly
            Brenda - took his life too. Oliver Burkeman and Gary
            Younge unravel the tragic story of Dr Money's sex
            experiment</p>

            <p><b>Wednesday May 12, 2004<br />
             The Guardian</b></p>

            <p class="3">Until a few years ago, the name David
            Reimer meant little to those outside his immediate
            circle, and by the time he killed himself last Tuesday
            in unknown circumstances in his hometown of Winnipeg,
            it was already slipping back towards obscurity - a name
            belonging to nobody more remarkable than a local
            odd-job man, a 38-year-old former slaughterhouse worker
            who was separated from his wife, and enjoyed shopping
            at flea markets and tinkering with his car.</p>

            <p class="3">In fact, to anyone taking an interest in
            the development of psychology in the 1970s and 1980s,
            Reimer's life story would have long been infamous, but
            also pseudonymous. Going by the name "John", and
            subsequently "Joan", David Reimer had been an unwitting
            guinea-pig - along with his identical twin brother
            Brian - in a medical experiment at first celebrated,
            then notorious. Masterminded by a prominent Baltimore
            physician, John Money, it was an attempt to settle,
            once and for all, the fraught nature-versus-nurture
            debate: to prove that gender was so fluid that by a
            mere change in childrearing practice, plus a little
            surgery, a boy could be turned into a girl, while his
            twin developed as a male.</p>

            <p class="3">It would split the world of sexual
            psychology in two. And after 12 years of traumatising
            treatment, followed by a further two decades spent
            attempting to repair the damage, it would drive David
            Reimer to his death."It was like brainwashing," Reimer
            once said, having resumed his male identity after a
            childhood spent as Brenda. "I'd give just about
            anything to go to a hypnotist to black out my whole
            past. Because it's torture. What they did to you in the
            body is sometimes not near as bad as what they did to
            you in the mind."</p>

            <p class="3">The tragedy has its roots in what seemed
            like a routine trip to hospital in 1966 for Janet and
            Ron Reimer and their twin baby boys, Bruce and Brian.
            Doctors had recommended circumcision, a practice still
            routine in much of north America, but Bruce's operation
            went distressingly wrong. Like almost every detail of
            the story, what actually happened is still fiercely
            disputed but what is clear is that the electric
            cauterising machine being used by doctors caused
            burning to his penis so severe as to render the organ
            unrescuable.</p>

            <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The circumcision was
            unnecessary. The male penis goes through various <a
            href="/library/normal/">stages of development</a> from
            birth to maturity. A poorly trained physician falsely
            diagnosed a normal developmental condition as
            pathological and improperly recommended circumcision.
            The circumcision then was horribly botched and resulted
            in the total necrosis of Bruce's penis. Twin brother
            Brian was also improperly diagnosed with the same
            condition, but after the accident with Bruce, Brian's
            circumcision was not performed. His penis eventually
            developed normally&mdash;which shows that the diagnosis
            was false and the circumcision unnecessary.]</p>

            <p class="3">Reconstructive genital surgery was still
            rudimentary, and medical experts could offer only
            pessimism. So when the despairing parents happened to
            catch a television show, some months later, on which
            John Money was propounding his radical new theories
            about gender formation, it seemed to offer a lifeline.
            "He was saying that it could be that babies are born
            neutral, and you could change their gender," Janet
            Reimer later told John Colapinto, author of a book on
            the experiment entitled <i>As Nature Made Him</i>.</p>

            <p class="3">In photographs taken at the time, Money -
            then, as now, affiliated to <a
            href="http://www.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Johns
            Hopkins University</a> in Baltimore, Maryland - looks
            like a parody of a progressive "sexologist",
            turtlenecked and moustachioed, and his writings did
            nothing to dispel that impression. Raised in a
            conservative religious family in New Zealand, he had
            rebelled and become a self-described "missionary of
            sex", revelling in shocked responses to his tireless
            advocacy of open marriages and - a particular favourite
            - bisexual group sex.</p>

            <p class="3">At their most extreme, Money's public
            statements had appeared to endorse, or at least not to
            condemn, incest and paedophilia, but there was no hint
            of that in the television show Janet and Ron Reimer
            saw. They wrote to him, and he wrote swiftly back. He
            was confident, he said, that Bruce could be
            successfully raised as a girl. From an experimental
            perspective, Brian Reimer would provide the perfect
            control: his genetic inheritance was identical to
            Bruce's. The only difference was that one would be
            nurtured as a girl, and the other as a boy.</p>

            <p class="3">Money's emphasis on nurture over nature
            played well with the progressive spirit of the times,
            and especially with the women's movement, its
            proponents eager to establish that women's traditional
            social roles were not biologically pre-ordained.
            "Postwar, in any case, there was a move away from
            people being innately, biologically, inherently
            anything," says Lynne Segal, professor of psychology
            and gender studies at <a href="http://www.bbk.ac.uk/"
            target="_blank">Birkbeck College</a> in London. "We'd
            just seen Nazism, and the emphasis had been put on the
            idea that certain people were innately evil - Jews and
            gypsies, among others - so the emphasis on culture and
            society fitted well with social democratic ideals." The
            Reimers did not engage in this kind of debate. "I
            looked up to [John Money] as a god," Janet said
            simply.</p>

            <p class="3">Bruce Reimer started to become Brenda on
            July 3, 1967. Physicians at Johns Hopkins surgically
            castrated him, and the remaining skin was used to forge
            a "cosmetic vaginal cleft". Money sent the family back
            to Winnipeg with strict instructions. "He told us not
            to talk about it," Ron Reimer told John Colapinto. "Not
            to tell [Brenda] the whole truth, and that she
            shouldn't know she wasn't a girl."</p>

            <p class="3">Things started going wrong almost
            immediately. Janet Reimer recalled dressing Brenda in
            her first dress just before the child was due to turn
            two. "She was ripping at it, trying to tear it off. I
            remember thinking, 'Oh, my God, she knows she's a boy
            and she doesn't want girls' clothing." Brenda was
            bullied viciously at school. When she urinated standing
            up in the school lavatories, she was threatened with a
            knifing.</p>

            <p class="3">Whether all the blame should lie with
            Money remains a matter of contention. His supporters
            argue that reconstructive surgery techniques of the
            time were such that trying to turn Bruce into Brenda
            might genuinely have been the least worst option. In
            public, Money advertised the "John/Joan" study as a
            resounding success. "This dramatic case," Time magazine
            reported, picking up on his salesmanship, "provides
            strong support for a major contention of women's
            liberationists: that conventional patterns on masculine
            and feminine behaviour can be altered."</p>

            <p class="3">In private, though, things were spinning
            into chaos. Brenda was required to attend regular
            therapy sessions with Money in Baltimore, in the
            company of her brother. According to Colapinto's
            account, they soon degenerated into horrifying
            encounters that deeply traumatised the two children.
            Showing the children "explicit sexual pictures" was
            seemingly central to Money's theories of gender
            reassignment. David Reimer later recalled, as Brenda,
            "getting yelled at by Money ... he told me to take my
            clothes off, and I just did not do it. I just stood
            there. And he screamed 'No!' I thought he was going to
            give me a whupping. So I took my clothes off and stood
            there, shaking."</p>

            <p class="3">In the children's grimmest recollection -
            one they found almost impossible to talk about years
            later - Money allegedly made "Brenda assume a position
            on all fours on his office sofa and make Brian come up
            behind her on his knees and place his crotch against
            her buttocks", an element of Money's theory he referred
            to as "sexual rehearsal play". (The author John
            Heidenry, who wrote a recent review defending the
            sexologist, calls this charge "outrageous and
            offensive", and says Brian, the source of the claim,
            may have been suffering false memory syndrome.)</p>

            <p class="3">By the time Brenda reached her teens she
            had attempted suicide at least once; she refused
            further surgery but consented, though irregularly, to
            take oestrogen supplements to encourage the development
            of breasts. John Money gradually drifted from the
            Reimers' lives, but Brenda remained under constant
            psychiatric treatment. It was after one such session
            with a Winnipeg psychiatrist in 1980 that Ron Reimer
            collected his daughter in the car and, instead of
            taking her home, drove her to an ice-cream parlour,
            where he told her everything.</p>

            <p class="3">The upturn in Reimer's fortunes lasted
            several years. Brenda opted for a sex change within
            weeks of her father telling her the truth. Thanks to
            developments in phalloplasty, Brenda, taking the name
            David, received surgery that after five years left him
            with a reconstructed penis resembling a real one, with
            limited sensation, and usable for sex. When he was 23
            he met Jane, a single mother of three, and married her
            soon afterwards. In 2000, he went public with his
            story.</p>

            <p>But his happiness didn't last. For reasons that
            remain unclear, David and Jane eventually separated.
            Then, two years ago, Brian Reimer apparently killed
            himself, taking an overdose of drugs he was taking for
            schizophrenia. David reportedly felt responsible for
            the death, and visited Brian's grave daily, weeding the
            plot and bringing fresh flowers.</p>

            <p class="3">Despite Colapinto's claims that David made
            a large amount of money from the book, those who knew
            him said he was often hard up; at the Transcona golf
            club, in Winnipeg's eastern suburbs, where he did odd
            jobs, the members had a whip round for him so he could
            afford to eat. Friends say he had became particularly
            distraught during the last few months after he bought
            thousands of dollars' worth of shares in an investment
            that flopped.</p>

            <p class="3">The world of psychology learned of the
            failure of Money's experiment through a <a
            href="/library/psych/diamond1/">paper</a> by a rival,
            Dr Milton Diamond, of the <a
            href="http://www.hawaii.edu/"
            target="_blank">University of Hawaii</a>, who
            eventually traced those who had taken over treatment of
            the twins. For Lynne Segal, the story of the experiment
            does not settle the nature/nurture debate one way or
            the other - her view, widely shared today, is that the
            dichotomy is false - but it shows the perils of
            psychologists trying to prove too much through
            research. "It's far too simplistic, and far too
            interventionist, this idea that we can control and
            model and shape people to prove one thing or
            another."</p>

            <p class="3">John Money remains an emeritus professor
            at Johns Hopkins. "He's not commenting on this story,"
            his assistant told the Guardian yesterday. "There is no
            comment to make."</p>
