      <h2>Tissue consent an issue</h2>

      <h3>Ethics council says military should have parental
      approval to use foreskin</h3>
      By PAUL COWAN, EDMONTON SUN 

      <p>An Alberta-based military research team using newborns'
      foreskins for chemical warfare research and the doctors who
      supply the raw material should have the parents' consent
      first, the president of the <a
      href="http://ncehr.medical.org/">National Council on Ethics
      in Human Research</a> told The Edmonton Sun.</p>

      <p>One of the Medicine Hat doctors involved in providing the
      foreskins to the <a href="http://www.dres.dnd.ca/">Defence
      Research Establishment</a> at CFB Suffield said parents were
      only told about the fate of the flesh if they asked.</p>

      <p>But Dr. Jan Storch, the president of the ethics council,
      said that isn't good enough.</p>

      <p>"About 10 years ago excess tissue was regarded as
      something that was quite useable for research purposes
      without asking consent," she said.</p>

      <p>"But the climate has changed and now the guidelines are
      that, as a mark of respect, permission should be sought to
      use the tissue for research.</p>

      <p>"I would think any university researcher applying to one
      of the granting authorities who did not follow the guidelines
      would be refused funding."</p>

      <p>The head of the chemical and biological warfare defence
      section at Suffield, Dr. Cam Boulet, said the project had
      been passed by both the ethics committee at the base and the
      Medicine Hat hospital about 10 years ago.</p>

      <p>"The hospital is responsible for supplying the tissue, but
      in view of what you have told me, we will be revisiting the
      arrangement," he told The Sun.</p>

      <p>"Until now I haven't been aware of a concern, but it is
      our policy to be as open as possible about our work."</p>

      <p>The Suffield scientists use cell scrapings from foreskins
      supplied by the hospital to grow cell cultures.</p>

      <p>The cultures are then used to test antidotes to various
      chemical weapons.</p>

      <p>Boulet estimated around 50 to 100 foreskins were used
      every year for the research over the last decade.</p>

      <p>Storch, director of the school of nursing at <a
      href="http://www.uvic.ca/">Victoria University</a> in B.C.,
      said it appeared the project had been approved before the
      guidelines on human tissue use and the need for express
      consent from donors were clarified.</p>

      <p>"This one appears to have slipped by so far but perhaps
      someone should look at it again in the light of current
      ethical thinking," she said.</p>

      <p>Medicine Hat is 600 km south of Edmonton.</p>
