            <h2>A different kind of penis envy: Students fight to
            save foreskins</h2>

            <p>Christopher Heredia, Chronicle Staff Writer</p>

            <p>Like many American boys, Greg Dervin was circumcised
            as an infant. Now, the 24-year-old San Francisco State
            student is fighting mad.</p>

            <p>Not only does he want his foreskin back, but he's
            also part of a growing student movement seeking to end
            male circumcision as well as other forms of what he and
            other "intactivists" term genital mutilation in the
            United States and abroad.</p>

            <p>Last year, Dervin formed the first college group in
            the United States with the mission of ending the
            cutting of children's genitalia, <a
            href="http://www.studentsforgenitalintegrity.org/"
            target="_blank">Students for Genital Integrity</a>. The
            group has spawned two similar organizations in Florida
            and Iowa. Two other chapters are starting, one in
            Washington, D.C., another in Phoenix, Ariz.</p>

            <p>Dervin's group's platform includes educating people
            about the practices of female genital mutilation as
            well as the surgical altering of the genitals of
            intersex children, infants born with both male and
            female genitalia or ambiguous genitalia.</p>

            <p>"We're not just anti-circumcision," Dervin said.
            "We're against any forced cutting of a child's
            genitalia. It's a human rights violation. There's no
            ethically responsible reason to continue to amputate
            healthy erogenous tissue." Dervin took an interest in
            male circumcision two years ago after coming across
            information about the procedure on the Internet. "An
            intellectual curiosity became a passion," he said. He
            majored in sociology at <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/"
            target="_blank">New York University</a> and is pursuing
            his master's in human sexuality studies at <a
            href="http://www.sfsu.edu/" target="_blank">San
            Francisco State</a>. Dervin is Jewish, and his foreskin
            was removed as part of his bris, a religious ceremony,
            on the eighth day of his life.</p>

            <p>Dervin and other members of his group are
            campaigning to educate parents, doctors and lawmakers
            about what they perceive as obsolete beliefs and
            cultural practices that lead parents and others to
            alter the sex organs of children and women. During a
            male circumcision, doctors remove the foreskin of the
            penis, a mobile sheath with <a
            href="http://research.cirp.org/"
            target="_blank">thousands of nerve endings</a>,
            reducing sensitivity and production of natural
            lubricants. In some African countries, girls and women
            have their clitoris removed as a rite of passage, for
            reasons including hygiene and preventing unwanted
            pregnancies.</p>

            <p>Dervin's group estimates that 3,000 American boys
            are circumcised daily (about two-thirds of male babies
            born daily) and that worldwide 6,000 females daily are
            at risk for female genital mutilation. According to the
            <a href="http://www.isna.org/" target="_blank">Intersex
            Society of North America</a>, 1 or 2 out of every 1,000
            children born have surgery to "normalize" genital
            appearance.</p>

            <p>Monthly meetings attract only a few people, Dervin
            said, but many more show up at the group's weekly table
            in the San Francisco State student quad. Some heckle,
            but others express appreciation for the work the group
            is doing. The group's e-mail list contains 130 people
            nationwide, 50 of whom live in the Bay Area.</p>

            <p>Dervin learned how in the late 1800s in
            English-speaking countries circumcision became popular
            as a way of reducing men's libidos and as a deterrent
            to masturbation. He read about devices created to keep
            boys from masturbating, including a ring with spikes
            meant to be attached to a boy's genitals.</p>

            <p>"It's not just about masturbation. It changes your
            sexual experience," Dervin said. "Yes, I'm pissed. I
            was denied a whole sexual experience. I was robbed. The
            experience should be my birthright."</p>

            <p>Mahndisa Rigmaiden, a 26-year-old physics major,
            joined Students for Genital Integrity to raise
            awareness about female genital mutilation as well as
            support the effort to end male circumcision.</p>

            <p>"None of these infants have a choice," she said.
            "When you look at it at a deeper level, it all has to
            do with the rights of the child being taken away. It
            has deep psychological implications. I think once
            people get educated, they'll be appalled."</p>

            <p>Health experts have been divided on the issue of
            male circumcision. Experts in impoverished African
            countries have recommended circumcision as a means of
            reducing HIV infection. In the United States, some
            studies have shown that uncircumcised men are more
            likely to develop penile cancer and urinary tract
            infections.</p>

            <p>In 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a
            <a href="/library/statements/aap1999/">policy
            statement</a> saying the value of circumcision wasn't
            sufficient to warrant its use as part of routine
            medical care.</p>

            <p>At <a
            href="http://www.kaiserpermanente.org/locations/california/mod06/mod06-department_34.html">
            Kaiser Permanente Medical Center</a> in San Francisco,
            neonatologist Carlos Botas, who oversees circumcision
            procedures at the hospital, leaves it up to the
            parents, as most doctors do today. About half of the
            1,200 boys born annually at Kaiser are circumcised,
            Botas said.</p>

            <p>Parents must sign a consent form allowing the doctor
            to remove the foreskin, after being told about the
            procedure and possible complications such as bleeding
            and infections, which Botas said are rare.</p>

            <p>"I find most parents have decided what they want to
            do before they walk in the door," said Botas, who like
            the academy believes there is no medical necessity for
            circumcision. "Usually the biggest predictor is the
            dad, whether he is circumcised or not. They want the
            son being the same as the dad. Moms are more reluctant
            to have their sons circumcised."</p>

            <p>Botas said the number of parents choosing to have
            their sons circumcised has declined over the past 20
            years, which he attributes to <a
            href="/library/legal/miller1/">changing cultural and
            societal beliefs</a>.</p>
