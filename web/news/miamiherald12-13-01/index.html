      <h2>Maximum sentence is sought for rabbi in Internet sex
      case</h2>

      <p><b>BY WANDA J. DeMARZO</b><br />

      <p>A former Boca Raton rabbi who pleaded guilty to prowling
      the Internet in search of teenage boys for sex could face up
      to 60 years in prison if federal prosecutors get their way in
      court next week.</p>

      <p>``[Jerrold] Levy is more than a child molester conspiring
      to have sex with minors,'' wrote U.S. federal prosecutor
      Lothrop Morris. ``He is a skilled predator who uses his
      knowledge of human frailty to sexually abuse and exploit
      minor victims.</p>

      <p>``His punishment should be sufficiently severe to deter
      other United States citizens who, like Levy, choose to
      sexually abuse and exploit the young and the
      vulnerable.''</p>

      <p>In a 29-page motion filed Dec. 6, Morris argued for a
      tough sentence that would send a message to other sexual
      predators. He revealed new details about Levy's behavior,
      saying the former associate rabbi at <a
      href="http://www.tbeboca.org/">Temple Beth El</a> spent hours
      in sex chat rooms exchanging lurid e-mail messages with young
      men nationwide, using the Internet name ``CoachBoca.'' He is
      alleged to have had unprotected sex with a Wellington
      14-year-old in the back of his black Toyota.</p>

      <p>Court filings say that Levy, 59, chatted online with two
      15-year-olds from Leawood, Kan., and Amelia, La., asking for
      nude photos and whether the boys had been
      <b>circumcised</b>.</p>

      <p>The August arrest shocked one of the region's largest
      Reform Jewish congregations, but many temple members have
      supported Levy. Dozens of letters on his behalf will be
      presented at his Dec. 20 sentencing, said Ira Loewy, Levy's
      defense attorney.</p>

      <p>``Jerry is not a pedophile. He's not a danger to anyone.
      He's accepted responsibility for his actions and wants
      help,'' he said.</p>

      <p>Loewy said he will ask the court to sentence Levy to a
      sexual-offender treatment program in Butner, N.C.</p>

      <p>However, prosecutors say a hefty sentence is
      warranted.</p>

      <p>``Levy intentionally selected vulnerable minor victims who
      were emotionally immature and confused about their sexual
      orientation and identities,'' Morris wrote.</p>

      <p>``I am astounded by the comments the prosecutor is making
      and their calling him a predator,'' said Stuart Grossman, an
      attorney representing the temple. ``They're looking at
      sending him away for the rest of his life as an example, and
      I don't know how they can say he is incapable of contributing
      to society.''</p>

      <p>Levy pleaded guilty Aug. 21 to two counts of using the
      Internet to solicit sex from minors and e-mailing child
      pornography videos. In exchange, prosecutors agreed to drop
      four child pornography charges against Levy. They also agreed
      not to argue for the maximum penalty, but the new evidence
      changed that stance.</p>
