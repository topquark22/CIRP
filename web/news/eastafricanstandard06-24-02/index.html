            <h2>[Girls hospitalized after female genital
            mutilation]</h2>

            <p><b>Titus Maero And Diana Etsabo</b></p>

            <p>Twenty girls are admitted at Ortum Mission Hospital
            in West Pokot after undergoing female genital
            mutilation (FGM). And among them, 10 have successfully
            been operated on by a team of doctors from <a href=""
            target="_blank">University of Nairobi</a> led by Dr
            Hillary Mabeya.</p>

            <p>The girls aged between 10 and 16 were rescued from
            bleeding to death by a local NGO, Setat Women Group -
            North Rift Chapter.</p>

            <p>The organisation's vice chairperson, Mrs Milka Krop,
            said they identified the girls through their field
            officers based at Parua, Lomut, Cheptuyal and Masol
            areas.</p>

            <p>Krop told reporters at their Makutano township
            offices yesterday that the organisation had intensified
            the war against FGM through seminars conducted at the
            village level.</p>

            <p>"Currently FGM is illegal the country,"added Krop
            noting that a list of parents who allow their daughters
            to be circumcised is being compiled to institute legal
            proceedings as one way of discouraging the vice. Krop
            further noted that circumcised girls eventually dropped
            out of school to be married off in exchange for cattle
            since they are subsequently regarded as women.</p>
