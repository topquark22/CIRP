            <h2>Death from Circumcision</h2>

            <p>Coroner Hills held an inquest yesterday at the Sixth
            Ward Stationhouse, in the case of the child whose death
            from circumcision was announced in Thursday's
            Times.<br />
            <br />
             The child, Myer Jacob Levy, (whose parents reside at
            No. 63 Baxter street,) being eight days old, was
            circumcised on Sunday last by Dr. Abrams, of Bleecker
            street, who performed the operation in the usual
            manner.<br />
            <br />
             A few hours afterwards it was discovered that the
            bandage was displaced and that the child was bleeding
            profusely.<br />
            <br />
             Dr. Abrams was recalled, but his efforts to stop the
            hemorrhage were ineffectual.<br />
            <br />
             The verdict was; "Death from convulsions, superinduced
            by loss of blood following circumcision; further we
            find that the operation was rightly performed."</p>
