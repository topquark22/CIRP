      <h2>Kenyans: End Genital Mutilation</h2>
      By CHEGE MBITIRU<br />
      <i>.c The Associated Press</i> 

      <p><b>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP)</b> - A leading women's law group
      in Kenya is pushing for a law banning female circumcision,
      saying this week's court ruling against the tradition is not
      enough.</p>

      <p>``It is high time we had a law that clearly criminalizes
      the practice,'' Martha Koome, head of the <a
      href="http://www.globalfundforwomen.org/OurWork/GranteeProfiles/GPfidak.html"
      target="_blank">Federation of Women Lawyers</a>, said
      Thursday.</p>

      <p>Koome spoke a day after Magistrate Daniel Ochenja issued a
      permanent injunction against farmer Pius Kandie to prevent
      him from forcing his 15-and-17-year-old daughters to undergo
      customary circumcision. The injunction handed down in Iten, a
      farming center 160 miles northwest of Nairobi, represents the
      first time a Kenyan court ruled against the forced
      circumcision of girls.</p>

      <p>In his ruling, Ochenja also ordered Kandie to continue
      providing material and financial care for his daughters, who
      are both in secondary school, despite their defiance.</p>

      <p>Koome said attorneys for the girls won the case not on the
      basis of law but because Ochenja had exercised his
      discretion. ``The outcome could have been different,
      depending on the magistrate or judge, because there is no
      clear law,'' she said.</p>

      <p>Circumcision of boys and girls is widely practiced in
      Kenya as a rite of passage to adulthood and is not illegal.
      For girls, the practice can involve clipping or burning the
      clitoris and cutting the external genitals. Defenders of
      female circumcision argue that the practice is allowed under
      customary law.</p>

      <p>Ken Wafula, the executive director of the Center for Human
      Rights and Democracy, which took the case to court, said in a
      telephone interview that Ochenja based his ruling on the
      premise that female circumcision constitutes assault. Wafula
      said customary law, which is recognized in the Kenyan <a
      href="http://www.rcbowen.com/kenya/constitution/"
      target="_blank">constitution</a>, supersedes statutory law
      ``only when it is not repugnant to justice and
      morality.''</p>

      <p>Wafula said Kandie told him he wanted the girls
      circumcised because he feared they might be returned home
      after marriage when their new husbands discovered they had
      not undergone the ritual. In such an event, Kandie would have
      to refund the dowry, which in Kenya is usually made up of
      cows, goats and sheep.</p>

      <p>Koome said Kenya is signatory to several international
      conventions that call circumcision of girls female genital
      mutilation and define it as a human rights violation.</p>

      <p>``Cutting a little girl is criminal,'' she said.</p>

      <p>Some groups, among them the <a href="http://www.fpak.org/"
      target="_blank">Kenya Family Planning Association</a>, want
      to preserve the ritual connected with female circumcision.
      They favor a symbolic ceremony that involves no cutting of
      the female genitalia but does recognize the importance of the
      passage to womanhood.</p>
