      <h2>`Intactivists' Seek to Undo A Long-Practiced Ritual</h2>

      <p>By <b>BARRY NEWMAN</b></p>

      <p>Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL</p>

      <p><b>CONCORD</b>, Calif. -- For over a century, in the
      belief that nature can be improved upon, Americans have
      circumcised their baby boys. Today, the value of circumcision
      as a health measure is in doubt in some quarters at a time
      when face lifts, tummy tucks and breast implants have lost
      their ability to shock us.</p>

      <p>Should it come as any surprise, then, that some men would
      try to regain what circumcision took away? "If you're willing
      to walk around with a pin through your tongue," says R. Wayne
      Griffiths, one of the principal founders of the
      foreskin-restoration movement, "this is not absurd at
      all."</p>

      <p>It is Sunday morning, and Mr. Griffiths is driving to
      church. His car's license plate reads "NORM.ORG," (<a
      href="http://www.norm.org/" target="_blank">www.norm.org</a>)
      Web site of the National Organization of Restoring Men, the
      fraternity he formed in 1989. Mr. Griffiths is 67 years old
      and works at a local sanitation district. He has white hair,
      a brush moustache, a voice like a creaky gate, and three
      matched pens in his shirt pocket. He's a Mormon.</p>

      <p>At church, he greets the bishop and takes a pew with his
      sister and brother-in-law. He joins in the opening hymn: "As
      I search the holy scriptures, may thy mercy be revealed.
      Soothe my troubled heart and spirit; may my unseen wounds be
      healed." He closes his eyes and prays. And during a baby
      blessing, when a mother sheds a tear, he leans over and
      whispers, "Sometimes you get emotional with children."</p>

      <p>Mr. Griffiths was married for 30 years before he got
      divorced. He has had six children; he has 21 grandchildren.
      That might be reason enough to get emotional about them, and
      about their unseen wounds. On the way home from church,
      driving past Pixi Land amusement park, he says, "Do you
      realize that the first sexual experience you ever had was
      also the worst trauma you've ever experienced? Maybe that
      went to the back of your mind and stayed there, just
      maybe."</p>

      <p>He parks outside a complex of tree-shaded apartments; his
      own is on the second floor, an American flag flying from its
      balcony. Inside, file boxes fill a small front room. Family
      snapshots cover the top of an upright piano. Above the couch
      hang four artful pictures of naked couples, clipped from a
      magazine and framed. The men in the pictures are all "intact"
      -- uncircumcised. Taking his <a
      href="/library/cultural/LDS/">Book of Mormon</a> from a
      shelf, Mr. Griffiths reads: "Wherefore, little children are
      whole, for they are not capable of committing sin; wherefore
      the curse of Adam is taken from them in me and ... the law of
      circumcision is done away in me."</p>

      <p>As Mr. Griffiths sees it, circumcision falls morally into
      the same category as abortion: Don't unless you must. Nothing
      beyond the fringe in that. Jews circumcise their boys to
      signify a covenant with God; Mormons don't, nor do many other
      <a href="/pages/cultural/christian.html">Christians</a>.
      Circumcision may still be the surgery performed most
      frequently in the U.S., but in other countries, far from it.
      And although many American doctors still insist it reduces
      urinary infections and a rare form of cancer, among other
      things, the practice is on the decline. Health authorities,
      including the <a href="/library/statements/aap1999/">American
      Academy of Pediatrics</a>, no longer deem routine
      circumcision of baby boys a medical necessity.</p>

      <p>That said, grown-up boys who try to undo their own
      circumcisions might well be deemed beyond the fringe, if not
      around the bend. Yet, in the multifarious firmament of lonely
      causes, foreskin restoration shines out as the purest
      Americana. In a new book on circumcision, David Gollaher,
      president of the California Healthcare Institute, calls it
      "the kind of enterprise that draws together far-flung
      individuals who share a narrow preoccupation." But they also
      share that overarching American belief that anyone can right
      any wrong.</p>

      <p>Of that, Wayne Griffiths is living proof. Religion didn't
      save him from an unkind cut, so he healed himself. It was no
      quick fix; he abhors scalpels. Instead, he adapted the
      standard tools of epidermal expansion to his anatomical
      circumstances: With surgical tape and weights, he stretched
      what he had left. Pacing himself between periods of rest and
      steady pressure, it took years. Along the way, he has helped
      thousands of men attempt the same, and put up with a quantity
      of ridicule. Mr. Griffiths' penile personal portraits have
      appeared in Bennetton's magazine (next to a facelift device
      and an artificial ear) as well as the <a
      href="/library/general/warren2/">British Journal of Sexual
      Medicine</a>.</p>

      <p>"Finally, a year or so ago," he says, "I was there." He
      rises from his couch, and proudly unbuckles his belt.
      Thirteen centuries before the birth of Jesus, ancient Egypt
      had already been circumcising its boys for millennia. Tribes
      in Africa, the Americas, Australia and Indonesia had, too,
      just as some cut off fingertips, pulled earlobes or yanked
      teeth. Circumcision, for Jews, was an act of faith, but
      perhaps also a badge of affiliation. Islam saw it as a means
      of moral purification. Freud called it a castration
      substitute, other psychoanalysts a fertility symbol. In his
      studies, Dr. Gollaher found "no theory" to fit "the myriad
      facts."</p>

      <p>It was America, however, that lent circumcision its renown
      for preventing disease on a mass scale. Beginning in the
      1870s, it was touted as a cure for ailments from hernia to
      imbecility. Before the advent of antibiotics, public-health
      doctors presented it to parents of newborns as vital to
      personal cleanliness and as a guard against syphilis. By
      1985, despite huge medical advances, 85% of baby boys in
      America had their foreskins cut; 60% still do.</p>

      <p><b>A Personal Journey</b><br />
      Mormonism never stopped the U.S. Army from circumcising Wayne
      Griffiths' father, nor a San Francisco doctor from
      circumcising the father's newborn son. But at age 12, Mr.
      Griffiths vividly remembers, he went to a fathers-and-sons
      chicken banquet in the church hall. One father, whose sons
      were intact, talked of circumcision and "how we shouldn't do
      it," he recalls. "From that time on, I suppose, I had a
      wonderment in my mind of what it would be like to be
      intact."</p>

      <p>He didn't dwell on it. Life was moving quickly: junior
      college, four years in the Navy, a sociology degree from <a
      href="http://www.byu.edu/home1.html" target="_blank">Brigham
      Young University</a>, a year as a San Quentin guard, back to
      school for a masters degree in criminology, four years in the
      Air Force, a masters in education, to Oregon for the Teachers
      Corps, and to Georgia as an assistant sociology professor at
      <a href="http://www.armstrong.edu/" target="_blank">Armstrong
      State University</a>. At 21, in the Navy, he married. In
      1956, his wife gave birth to twin boys, one stillborn. Was
      the other to be circumcised?</p>

      <p>"They brought the child to my wife," says Mr. Griffiths.
      "I went out and walked in front of the hospital, thinking:
      Why am I doing this to him? But I did do it -- out of fear
      the hospital would call me some kind of pervert. I was in the
      military. I didn't want to jeopardize my children or my
      marriage by doing something heinous." With the birth of
      another boy three years later, he made the same choice. "In
      the 1950s," he says, "you didn't tell doctors not to do
      something. The power was theirs. You didn't buck it."</p>

      <p>Yet he couldn't shake the idea. In 1971, his brother Keith
      went into business as a construction consultant and asked him
      to come home to join in. Fate had its cue. Keith and Mr.
      Griffiths' 17-year-old son, Brett, died in a Piper Cub crash
      two years later. Mr. Griffiths' marriage soon died, too. By
      1981, he was alone in Concord, working free-lance, seeing a
      therapist. "I felt diminished," he says. "You might say I
      felt emasculated." And then, in a fluke reflecting modern
      America's engines of social change, he watched a talk
      show.</p>

      <p><b>A Pivotal Moment</b><br />
      Phil Donahue, that day in 1987, had as his guests a
      syndicated radio doctor, Dean Edell, and a nurse named
      Marilyn Milos, both early and impassioned "intactivists."
      With them was a man who had tried to have a new foreskin
      surgically attached. "It was the first time I saw my inner
      thoughts expressed by someone else," says Mr. Griffiths. He
      called Ms. Milos, who sent him the name of a New Orleans
      dentist, who referred him to a Seattle engineer who was
      toying with nonsurgical foreskin restoration, using tape.</p>

      <p>Mr. Griffiths went for it -- and went a step further. He
      phoned Bearing Engineering in Emeryville, Calif., purchased a
      set of stainless-steel bearings, welded them together and
      created a "tandem-bearing device." It looked like a barbell,
      two inches long. Deploying tape and the bearings in a manner
      best described as inspired, he achieved ideal tension for
      tissue expansion. It worked. The patent is pending.</p>

      <p>"To feel whole again, that was the motive for me," Mr.
      Griffiths says. "Everyone should feel good about their body.
      I wanted something more -- to have what might have been. I
      really felt I wanted to be covered, and I am. That's
      happened." The accuracy of this claim, as Wayne Griffiths
      buckles up his belt, is hereby confirmed.</p>

      <p>In the 1980s, a grass-roots attack on circumcision was
      gaining ground. Medical arguments aside, opponents compared
      it with genital mutilation of girls by other cultures. In the
      midst of his personal toils, Mr. Griffiths went to
      anticircumcision events and, at one, he met a man named Tim
      Hammond, who turned out to be absorbed in the same isolated
      pursuit. Swapping notes, they agreed it would be nice to
      start a support group -- and the foreskin-restoration
      movement was born.</p>

      <p>To announce a first meeting, in February of 1990, the two
      took out ads in San Francisco's alternative press; if guys
      are squeamish about discussing their privates in public, they
      thought, gay guys might be less so. Two dozen men showed up
      that first time. Then 60. Meetings moved from apartments to a
      church. The gay-straight mix of the participants soon
      mirrored those of males in general.</p>

      <p>In 1992, <a href="/library/restoration/bigelow1/">Jim
      Bigelow</a>, a psychologist who had also seen the Donahue
      show, published a book called "<a
      href="/pages/reviews/bigelow/"><i>The Joy of
      Uncircumcising</i>.</a>" In its third printing today, it has
      sold 18,000 copies. While Mr. Hammond resumed the
      circumcision fight, Mr. Griffiths built <a
      href="http://www.norm.org/" target="_blank">NORM</a>, his
      organization, into a network. It now has 27 U.S. chapters,
      plus five overseas. The Web, at last count, had 16
      foreskin-restoration sites.</p>

      <p>A popular fervor for human rights, frankly, didn't spark
      this response. Sex did. The <a
      href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">natural foreskin is ingrained
      with nerves</a>, like any erogenous zone. In the past, some
      justified clipping it off to suppress sexuality. Whether that
      works, or works the opposite way, is an unanswered question.
      Mr. Griffiths and his friends promise that restoration
      heightens sensitivity. A number of them were circumcised
      later in life and know those nerves never grow back; all they
      can really promise is a faux skin. Yet Mr. Griffiths believes
      men seek him out, deep down, for reasons less physical than
      psychological, and maybe a little political.</p>

      <p>"They come for personal reasons, and then they get
      enlightened about the broader issue," he says. "It clicks
      immediately." When he takes off his hard hat and comes home
      after a day inspecting sewerage projects, Mr. Griffiths often
      finds 100 e-mails on his computer. He tries to answer each
      one. "Many are angry at doctors and parents. I tell them, if
      you start restoration, maybe you can do something with that
      anger, something constructive." Marilyn Milos, who has led
      circumcision protests for years, says this about Wayne
      Griffiths and the foreskin restorers: "They are men willing
      to declare: We've been wounded. It's affected our sexuality
      and our minds, and we're doing something about it. And Wayne
      is willing to lead that movement, writing long letters, week
      after week, with the gentleness of a father."</p>

      <p>"I applaud their courage," says Ms. Milos. "These aren't
      kooks. They're just different from others backing the cause.
      I mean, wearing weights on the end of their penises -- this
      isn't lobbying, is it?"</p>

      <p><b>Meeting the Faithful</b><br />
      Another Sunday. Mr. Griffiths has skipped church to put in an
      appearance at NORM's <a href="http://www.norm-socal.org/"
      target="_blank">chapter in Los Angeles</a>. Gary Harryman,
      who sells home sites in Topanga Canyon, picks him up at the
      airport. Mr. Harryman has been restoring for a few years.
      They drive to Culver City, discussing raccoon traps, and park
      at a powder-blue cube where support groups meet. Today's
      calendar also lists Survivors of Child Abuse, Anger Release
      and Co-Dependents Anonymous. A room of couches and soft
      chairs has filled with 25 men from their late teens to early
      70s. Mr. Harryman presents the guest of honor: "This is our
      grand pere," he says.</p>

      <p>"Happy to be here," says Mr. Griffiths. "Men all over the
      world want to know what they can do to restore. We're happy
      to help."</p>

      <p>In turn, the men give first names and, later, occupations:
      locksmith, longshoreman, hairdresser, machinist, locomotive
      engineer, set designer, film producer, dentist, doctor,
      college professor.</p>

      <p>"I'm Vincent, and I've been restoring for three years,
      thanks in good part to Wayne," says one. Bruce says, "I've
      been restoring for 28 months. I called you, Wayne. I remember
      our whole conversation." And Bill: "I've been at it for two
      months. This is the first program of personal growth where
      I've actually seen some personal growth!" Everyone laughs,
      and then settles down for a two-hour session on
      foreskin-stretching mechanics, aided by charts, plastic
      models and exhibitions. A loud banging intrudes from
      somewhere; it sounds like construction, but no one seems
      distracted. Mr. Griffiths talks of Meissner's corpuscles and
      somatosensory receptors. And he says:</p>

      <p>"You can restore if you want, but you can also educate
      others not to circumcise their boys." That still isn't easy
      in America: Of Mr. Griffiths' own 11 grandsons, five have
      been cut. "We need to make our voices heard," he says. "All
      of us should do whatever we can that feels comfortable. I'm
      not trying to get you to do anything wild."</p>

      <p>When the meeting closes, Mr. Griffiths shakes hands all
      around, listens to more personal stories, and finally heads
      for the airport. The men stick around, discussing
      foreskin-restoration gear the way some guys discuss fishing
      tackle. One of them, Richard Zerla, circulates an album of
      his personal penile portraits.</p>

      <p>"That banging next door, you hear it?" he says as the
      others flip through it. "It's the anger-release group. They
      beat on pillows! You can't imagine what people get up to on
      this earth."</p>
