      <h1>Newcastle Mohel Denies GMC Charge</h1>

      <p>REFORM movement leaders have voiced support for Peter
      Silverstone, the retired doctor at the centre of a <a
      href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/">General Medical Council</a>
      hearing into alleged "botched" circumcisions.</p>

      <p>It was claimed at the London <a
      href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/probdocs/probdoc_frameset.htm">hearing</a>
      that Mr. Silverstone failed properly to anaethetise two boys
      under-going non-religious <a href="">circumcisions</a>,
      causing them to scream uncontrollably.</p>

      <p>Although the retired obstetrician and gynaecologist had
      performed religious circumcisions, he had "insufficient"
      medical experience, it was said.</p>

      <p>The hearing was also told that one of the boys bled for
      several hours after being sent home, requiring two stitches
      to his penis.</p>

      <p>The parents of the two boys were allegedly pressed by Tyne
      and Wear GP Michael Harbinson to have them circumcised to
      alleviate medical problems.</p>

      <p>Dr Harbinson had referred them to Mr Silverstone, from
      Newcastle, who was paid from the GP's fund-holding
      budget.</p>

      <p>Both men deny serious professional misconduct through the
      provision of sub-<a href="/library/statements/gmc/">standard
      treatment</a>.</p>

      <p>Speaking to the JC on Wednesday, a prominent member of
      Newcastle Reform Synagogue -- to which Mr. Silverstone
      belonged before a recent move to London -- paid tribute to
      his skills a mohel.</p>

      <p>The congregant, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "He
      was very good. He has done a number of <i>brises</i> for us,
      and we never had any trouble. They were all highly
      successful."</p>

      <p>Mr. Silverstone is a member of the Association of Reform
      and Liberal Mohelim, whose chairman, <a
      href="/library/ethics/wilks1/">Nigel Zoltie</a>, is due to be
      a witness at the GMC hearing.</p>

      <p>He said: "We are supportive of Peter Silverstone because
      he is a member of the association, but we have no comment to
      make on the allegations, because these were not religious
      circumcisions."</p>

      <p>Mr. Zoltie stressed that he would be involved in the case,
      "not as chair of the mohelim association, but as an expert on
      circumcision."</p>

      <p>The hearing is expected to last for two weeks.<br />
