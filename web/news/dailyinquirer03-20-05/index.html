            <h2>Boys' rite of passage best on Black Saturday</h2>

            <p>Posted 04:15am (Mla time) Mar 20, 2005<br />

             Inquirer News Service</p>

            <p>BULALACAO, Oriental Mindoro -- Planning a
            circumcision? How about on Black Saturday?</p>

            <p>Boys here, aged 9&ndash;12, prefer to have their
            circumcision done on Sabado de Gloria (Black Saturday)
            because according to traditional beliefs, it would be
            less bloody than having it done on Good Friday,
            according to Dextex Gonzales, a government official and
            community leader.</p>

            <p>According to local folklore, God suffered and died
            on Good Friday and parents wouldn't want that
            experience replicated during their sons'
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>"God is already alive on Black Saturday, so it would
            be less bloody," Gonzales explained his town's beliefs.
            In combined Filipino and English, Gonzales shared with
            the Inquirer his experiences about this summer rite of
            passage.</p>

            <h4><i>Cleaning procedure</i></h4>

            <p>"Early morning of Sabado de Gloria, between 5 a.m.
            and 6 a.m., the boys clean themselves up by taking a
            bath. Together with their peers, they arrange their
            circumcision with a man who is experienced in doing
            this," he narrated.</p>

            <p>"Circumcision is done in a forested area so girls
            cannot see them. According to our beliefs, if a girl
            sees the circumcision, the boys' scrotum will grow
            big," he said.</p>

            <p>First, the boys undergo a cleaning procedure, or
            panlanggas in the dialect. Guava leaves are boiled and
            the lukewarm water is used to clean the male organ (the
            non-traditional way uses penicillin).</p>

            <p>A hole is made in the middle of a white cloth where
            the male organ is inserted and tied with a piece of
            cloth.</p>

            <p>Leaves of potat, a wild tree, are softened by
            pinching with the fingers. It is held over a fire, to
            sterilize it, and then applied on the male organ.</p>

            <p>During the actual circumcision, a stainless steel
            razor called labaha is used to cut the skin of the male
            organ.</p>

            <h4><i>Bathing in the sea</i></h4>

            <p>After the circumcision, the boys bathe in the sea.
            Bulalacao, the southernmost part of Oriental Mindoro
            province and about five hours by land from Puerto
            Princesa City, is famous for its beautiful and pristine
            beaches.</p>

            <p>"A newly circumcised boy is not allowed to go out
            from Monday to Friday as it is risky and old folks
            claim that a snake will come out and bite him,"
            Gonzales said.</p>

            <p>He said locals believe the male organ would have a
            better appearance when circumcised the traditional way,
            compared to having it done in the hospital.</p>

            <p>"This is because the skin on the penis is stripped
            off. The skin is stretched back, so it is still intact,
            unlike in a hospital where the skin is also cut off,"
            he explained.</p>

            <p>"After paltak or cutting, the boys are asked to jump
            to minimize the bleeding. Some boys chew on guava
            leaves to divert their attention and ease the pain.
            They close their eyes and then it's all over," he
            added. "Some apply the chewed guava leaves to the wound
            to speed up healing, which ordinarily takes two
            weeks."</p>
