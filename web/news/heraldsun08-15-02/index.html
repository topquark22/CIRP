            <h2>Circumcision blamed for assaults</h2>

            <p>A TRADITIONAL Aborigine who attacked his wife and
            father-in-law thought his circumcision had affected his
            mind, a Darwin court has been told.</p>

            <p>Peter Fernando's wife and her father had taunted him
            about his circumcised penis before he bashed them both
            on May 22, defence lawyer Sharon Lacy told Darwin
            Magistrates Court.</p>

            <p>Fernando, 28, was jailed for 10 months after
            pleading guilty this week to the assaults.</p>

            <p>The three lived on Bathurst Island, north of Darwin,
            where the Tiwi people no longer circumcise their young
            men, the court was told.</p>

            <p>Relatives had taken Fernando as a child to his
            mother's traditional country at Port Keats, west of
            Darwin, where his foreskin was removed in an initiation
            ceremony.</p>

            <p>"The issue of the circumcision for Mr Fernando was a
            very significant one," Ms Lacy said.</p>

            <p>"In his mind, that act of circumcision is what
            brought bad spirit to him that made his mind not
            function in a normal state."</p>

            <p>As well as the penis taunts from his wife, Fernando
            had also endured his father-in-law's ridicule over his
            lack of an Aboriginal tribal name.</p>

            <p>Ms Lacy told magistrate Greg Cavanagh that on the
            day of the attack, Fernando had been further humiliated
            by finding his wife outside their house smoking
            cannabis with her brother.</p>

            <p>"This was, on my instructions, forbidden," Ms Lacy
            said.</p>

            <p>"Not the cannabis smoking, but to be engaged with
            her brother, who was a married person, in a one-on-one
            situation.</p>

            <p>"He was furious about this. He saw this as great
            disrespect to him, but also something that might bring
            great trouble."</p>

            <p>Mr Cavanagh imposed a four-month non-parole period,
            accepting that Fernando had lost dignity before the
            attack.</p>

            <p>On his release, Fernando intended to return to Port
            Keats for a ceremony to remove the bad spirit, the
            court heard.</p>
