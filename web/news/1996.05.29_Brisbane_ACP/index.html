            <h2>STATEMENT OF AUSTRALIAN COLLEGE OF PAEDIATRICS</h2>

            <h3>DOCTOR WARNING ON CIRCUMCISION</h3>

            <p>Routine circumcision should not be performed on baby
            boys under six months old, the <a
            href="/library/statements/acp1996/">Australian College
            of Pediatrics</a> stated yesterday.</p>

            <p>"That is what is happening in the real world,"
            college registrar Tim Bohane said last night.</p>

            <p><a href="/library/statements/aaps/">Pediatric
            surgeons</a> rated circumcision without anaesthetic of
            newborn boys "traumatic".</p>

            <p>"We are not in disagreement," Dr Bohane said.</p>

            <p>The college had seen a sharp drop in circumcision in
            Australia after its firm anti-circumcision stance of
            1982, endorsed in 1990; but had now slightly eased its
            stance, he said.</p>

            <p>Fewer than 10 percent of infant boys were now
            circumcised and the college recommended that if parents
            considered it necessary, they should wait until the
            child was a month old and able to have anaesthetics, he
            said.</p>

            <p>Dr Bohane told the college's annual scientific
            meeting in Brisbane that there were no medical
            indications for routine circumcision.</p>

            <p>The possibility of the operation, performed on a
            minor for no medical benefit, being a breach of human
            rights had to be determined in the courts, he said.</p>

            <p>"The college has reviewed evidence in relation to
            risk and benefits and has concluded that it is not
            possible to be dogmatic on the exact risk-benefit
            ratio," Dr Bohane said.</p>

            <p>"There are suggestions of reduction in the risk of
            urinary tract infections; of local inflammatory
            conditions of the penis; and later cancer of the
            penis."</p>
