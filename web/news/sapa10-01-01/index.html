      <h1>Circumcision cut in Sweden</h1>

      <p><strong>Stockholm -</strong> A law restricting
      circumcisions took effect on Monday in Sweden, despite
      opposition from Jewish groups.</p>

      <p>The law, which the Swedish parliament passed on June 1,
      requires circumcision to be performed only by a physician or
      another person with appropriate training. It also requires
      the administration of an analgesic or an anaesthetic in
      connection with the procedure.</p>

      <p>"Brith Milah," the Hebrew expression for circumcision, is
      practiced on Jewish boys eight days after birth. It also is a
      rite of passage in Islam, generally for older boys.</p>

      <p>Bo Lindblom, deputy director of Sweden's <a
      href="http://www.sos.se/">National Board of Health and
      Welfare</a>, said the legislation arose after a handful of
      serious injuries and a death occurred during circumcisions in
      the Scandinavian country. He said most of those injured were
      Muslims.</p>

      <p>Jewish groups pointed out that circumcision has been
      performed safely throughout history and criticised the
      legislation as an "unnecessary" restriction on freedom of
      religion.</p>

      <p>Circumcision is usually performed by physicians and
      "mohels", who are trained to perform the sacred Jewish
      ceremony. Under the new law, a mohel can apply for a special
      permit to perform the ceremony, but somebody must be
      qualified to administer the analgesic.</p>

      <p>"There are no other countries that have laws like this,"
      said Rabbi Philip Spectre of the Great Synagogue in
      Stockholm. "I think the backlash will be tremendous around
      the world."</p>

      <p>Spectre said the new law also could pose practical
      problems because it may sometimes be difficult to find a
      physician or a nurse, for example on Sundays, and it wasn't
      clear what type of analgesic would be required.</p>

      <p>Many circumcisions in the Jewish tradition are performed
      without pain killers, he said, although sometimes a salve is
      used to numb the child before the procedure.</p>

      <p>Lindblom said the law provided important precautions to
      protect the health of children.</p>

      <p>"When an operation is not performed because of injury or
      handicap you want to apply stricter standards so that it is
      safe," Lindblom said. "Just a salve is not enough." -
