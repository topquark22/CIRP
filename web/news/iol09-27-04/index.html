            <h2>Botched circumcisions 'drain state coffers'</h2>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/"
            target="_blank">Eastern Cape government</a> has spent
            R104-million treating botched traditional circumcisions
            since 2001, according to provincial health minister
            Bevan Goqwana.</p>

            <p>He released the figure on Monday at a three-day
            conference on circumcision in East London.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">He said it cost R700 a day for
            an initiate to be treated in hospital, and those
            injured spend on average 30 days in
            hospital.</span></p>

            <p>Since the introduction of the province's Traditional
            Circumcision Act in 2001, <span class="yellow">a total
            of 4 932 initiates had been admitted to
            hospital.</span></p>

            <p>The conference is being attended by traditional
            leaders from across the Eastern Cape and other
            provinces, by traditional healers and surgeons,
            academics, and representatives of local government and
            the provincial departments of health and traditional
            affairs.</p>

            <p>Goqwana told them that there was a "leadership void"
            in dealing with the issue of circumcision and
            initiation in general.</p>

            <p>He challenged traditional leaders to take the
            initiative in seeking "sustainable" solutions to the
            challenges faced by the custom.</p>

            <p>"The conference was called because there are botched
            circumcisions," one of the organisers, Prince Langa
            Mavuso, told Sapa earlier. "Traditional leaders decided
            that we should not keep quiet when people are
            dying."</p>

            <p>Mavuso said women had also been invited to the
            conference "because they've got a role as far as
            initiation is concerned."</p>

            <p>"The women are the ones who build the initiation
            lodge with grass, and also they have a role in cooking
            for the child." - Sapa</p>
