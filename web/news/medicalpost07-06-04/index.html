            <h2>B.C. college statement tightens its circumcision
            recommendations</h2>

            <p>By Lynn Haley</p>

            <p>VANCOUVER &ndash; Opponents of circumcision are
            applauding a new policy statement issued by the <a
            href="http://www.cpsbc.bc.ca/" target="_blank">B.C.
            College of Physicians and Surgeons</a>.</p>

            <p>Dr. Peter Seland, deputy registrar (ethics) of the
            college, said the new statement is intended to help
            physicians navigate this minefield.</p>

            <p>The <a href="/library/statements/cpsbc2004/"
            target="_blank">statement</a> advises that circumcision
            may be carried out only when it is in the best
            interests of the child. It also says the procedure has
            no medical or prophylactic values and that doctors must
            advise parents of the associated risks including
            urinary tract infection, urinary retention, meatal
            stenosis and hemorrhage (as was seen in a recent B.C.
            case that resulted in the <a
            href="/news/theprovince08-29-02/" target="_blank">death
            of a one-month-old</a>).</p>

            <p>Doctors are under no obligation to circumcise the
            child at the request of parents, the statement
            says.</p>

            <p>"There is a never-ending stream of concerns that we
            get at the college around this issue," said Dr. Seland.
            "There is nothing in terms of the intensity of the
            debate that separates this from abortion. People have
            very strong views about this issue.</p>

            <p>"But when you cut through it all and examine it, it
            appears there is still a small portion of our society
            that might have been making the decision without being
            fully informed as to its implications, making decisions
            on such flimsy grounds as 'We want him to be like
            daddy.' So we really wanted a tool for physicians to
            look at, and think about where we're at, not just from
            a medical point of view."</p>

            <p>The trump of course, Dr. Seland said, is the
            cultural and religious aspects of
            circumcision&mdash;unlike female genital mutilation
            which, Dr. Seland says, is off-the-wall.</p>

            <p>"Since male circumcision is neutral medically, you
            can't really say that medical indications trump
            religious preferences," he noted. "The flames were
            fanned when <a
            href="http://www.circumstitions.com/death-exsang.html"
            target="_blank">that baby died in Penticton</a>. It
            spurred us on to come out with this guideline."</p>

            <p>Such a procedure at birth could conceivably have a
            traumatic effect in later years, said Dr. Seland.</p>

            <p>"There is (also) the issue that a decision has been
            made by the parents to do this on weak grounds, and the
            result is the adult male is denied erogenous pleasure,
            though I don't know whether anybody will ever know that
            for certain," he said.</p>

            <p>Dennis Harrison, a spokesman for the Canadian group
            <a href="http://www.courtchallenge.com/"
            target="_blank">Association for Genital Integrity</a>,
            welcomes the changes in policy from the college. He
            says the focus on bioethics and human rights will help
            provide physicians with the tools they need to guide
            parents around the complex issues surrounding the
            procedure.</p>

            <p>"This is very difficult for many parents, because
            there is often the conflict between the parents' rights
            and the child's right," said Harrison. "But in a
            country like Canada, the vast majority of circumcisions
            are not done for religious reasons. . . . It's true
            that parents are responsible for making decisions on
            behalf of their children, <span class="yellow">but
            there is no surgical operation a parent can consent to
            without medical need, and circumcision is not medically
            necessary.</span> We applaud the college's guidelines,
            but we think they could have gone further."</p>
