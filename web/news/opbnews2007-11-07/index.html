            <h2>Justices Focus On Procedure During Circumcision
            Arguments</h2>

            <p>By Colin Fogarty<br />
            <br />
             Salem, OR November 6, 2007 3:37 p.m.</p>

            <p>The <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/index.htm"
             target="_blank">Oregon Supreme Court</a> heard oral
            arguments Tuesday on whether a divorced father can have
            his 12-year-old son circumcised. The father converted
            to Judaism. But the boy&rsquo;s mother objects to the
            circumcision, saying the procedure would violate her
            son&rsquo;s civil rights.<br />
            <br />
             The case has attracted national attention since this
            is the highest court to consider circumcision. But as
            Colin Fogarty reports, the justices focused on more
            procedural issues.</p>
            <hr align="center" width="300" color="gray" size="2" />

            <p>Lia Boldt&rsquo;s fight to keep her son from being
            circumcised has becoming a rallying cry for the
            Seattle-based group, <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Doctor&rsquo;s Opposing
            Circumcision</a>. Its attorney <a
            href="http://www.claypatrick.com/"
            target="_blank">Clayton Patrick</a> was hoping to
            convince the Oregon Supreme Court that circumcision --
            especially for a 12-year-old boy -- is medically
            unnecessary, risky, and cruel.<br />
            <br />
             He asked the justices to reverse a decision by lower
            court judge who sided with the parent who has custody
            of the boy, his father James Boldt.<br />
            <br />
             Clayton Patrick: "She said I am of the opinion that
            this decision is reserved to the custodial parent. In
            other words, the custodial parent can circumcise the
            child, period. But with all due respect I think if the
            custodial parent had decided to amputate some other
            body part, I think the court could step in and say, no
            you can&rsquo;t do that."<br />
            <br />
             But <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/gillettebio.htm"
             target="_blank">Justice Michael Gillette</a> was
            skeptical. What if the boy&rsquo;s mother objected to
            her son being signed up to play football? he
            asked.<br />
            <br />
             Michael Gillette: "She files an affidavit that says
            here are the national statistics who suffers serious
            physical injury from playing football. On that basis, I
            get custody. The answer to that is that&rsquo;s
            preposterous, which I hope you recognize."<br />
            <br />
             In fact the hour long hearing was full of
            analogies.<br />
            <br />
             <a href="http://www.familylawattorney1.com/"
            target="_blank">James Boldt</a>, the father in this
            case, represented himself. He wondered whether a
            custodial parent could decide to send his child to
            Catholic high school, join the Boy Scouts, sign up for
            the military, or allow the child to date?<br />
            <br />
             Boldt quoted legal briefs by his ex-wife to bolster
            his own argument.<br />
            <br />
             James Boldt: "She said quote 'the child is not old
            enough to make that decision for himself. That is what
            parents are for.' And that may be the one thing that we
            agree on."<br />
            <br />
             Boldt referred to himself in the third person, as the
            father or the custodial parent. He argued his ex-wife
            is asking the court to single out circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             James Boldt: "And for all these other decisions that
            are probably far more important in the long run, for
            that the custodial parent makes the decision.
            There&rsquo;s no reason and we have heard a reason
            sited by the other side..."<br />
            <br />
             Robert Durham: "I agree with you. But that&rsquo;s
            utterly beside the point."<br />
            <br />
             That&rsquo;s <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/durhambio.htm"
             target="_blank">Justice Robert Durham</a> getting to
            the point that appeared to be of most interest to the
            justices of the Oregon Supreme Court. They spent the
            bulk of their time avoiding the broad topics of
            circumcision and parental rights.<br />
            <br />
             Instead, the court appeared to be focused on a
            procedural issue. Justice Durham said the question is
            whether the lower court made a mistake by failing to
            conduct a full hearing on whether this boy should get
            circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             Robert Durham: "I promise you, we&rsquo;re not
            attempting to weigh football versus the military versus
            tattoos etc in this case. The question has to do with
            the applicable legal standard and whether the trial
            court transgressed or honored the applicable rules that
            govern the request for a hearing."<br />
            <br />
             In other words, did the mother&rsquo;s concerns about
            circumcision rise to the level of requiring a full
            hearing.<br />
            <br />
             The boy was nine years old when this case started.
            He&rsquo;s 12 now. His father said his son told a
            doctor and other family members that he does want the
            circumcision as part of his own conversion to Judaism.
            But Lia Boldt said in court documents that her son told
            her he doesn&rsquo;t want a circumcision but was afraid
            of contradicting his father.<br />
            <br />
             All of that presents other questions to the court --
            ones that are not procedural at all: what does the
            child really want and at what age does that opinion
            matter?</p>
