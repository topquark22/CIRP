            <h2>Initiate deaths doubled under new laws</h2>

            <p>July 22 2003 at 03:39AM</p>

            <p><b>Initiate deaths have risen more than 100 percent
            since laws were put in place two years ago to curb the
            deaths and injuries.</b></p>

            <p>According to Daily Dispatch archive statistics,
            since 1998 a total of 129 initiates have died as a
            result of botched circumcisions in the province - 74 of
            these after November 2001, when the Application of
            Health Standards Act on Traditional Circumcision was
            promulgated.</p>

            <p>The figures show 55 initiates died in the period
            from January 1998 until the Act was implemented.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">A total of 25 initiates died in
            the June intake for circumcision in the province this
            year.</span></p>

            <table align="left" width="100" summary="">
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <p class="box">"We are very disappointed after
                  all our efforts"</p>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p><span class="yellow">Sixteen had to have their
            penises amputated and 92 were admitted to
            hospitals.</span></p>

            <p>Now the act on circumcision is being criticised as
            "technically flawed".</p>

            <p>"The legislation has failed the acid test," said the
            <a href="http://www.da.org.za/DA/Site/Eng/DEFAULT.htm"
            target="_blank">Democratic Alliance</a> spokesperson on
            health in the province, Athol Trollip.</p>

            <p>"The biggest problem is that some boys are too young
            to undergo circumcision. That's why circumcisions are
            botched."</p>

            <p>Problematic "circumcision hotspots" were in Qumbu,
            Mtsimbini, Ntshilini, Ngangelizwe, Libode and Ngqeleni,
            said Buffalo City Traditional Circumcision Association
            spokesperson Vuyani Sijako.</p>

            <table align="left" width="100" summary="">
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <p class="box">A "tragic season of
                  circumstances"</p>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>In Buffalo City it was Scenery Park, Duncan Village
            and Mdantsane.</p>

            <p>Sizwe Kupelo of the health department admitted the
            situation had gone from "bad to worse since December
            last year".</p>

            <p>"Traditional leaders, communities and Xhosas have
            failed the custom," he said.</p>

            <p>"This is not our responsibility as a department. We
            are only trying to help, we are not the custodians of
            tradition."</p>

            <p>Kupelo said they spent R140 000 this year to train
            traditional surgeons, host roadshows and visit schools
            and traditional leaders.</p>

            <p>"We also spent R200 000 on vehicle hire so that
            department officials could monitor initiation schools
            and traditional surgeons and nurses."</p>

            <p>"We are very disappointed after all our efforts,"
            said Kupelo.</p>

            <p>Kupelo also blamed parents for not ensuring children
            were prepared for the rite.</p>

            <p>The department is now analysing the situation and
            will work with all stakeholders to devise another
            strategy.</p>

            <p>"We will also work with police to prosecute those
            traditional surgeons who don't comply with
            registration," he added.</p>

            <p>PAC MPL Zingisa Mkabile labelled the circumcision
            fatalities as a "tragic season of circumstances".</p>

            <p>He said the legislation of 2001 was never
            well-funded.</p>

            <p>"There is only one person at head office monitoring
            provincial circumcision," he said.</p>

            <p>There were no structures at local and district level
            to keep track of the situation.</p>

            <p>Mkabile said the department was not "committed to
            implementing the Act".</p>

            <p>"Instead of visiting the fly-by-night bomas MEC
            Goqwana should concentrate on implementing the bill
            properly," he added. - Sapa</p>
