            told</h2>

            <p><b>Windsor</b> A nine-week-old baby boy bled to
            death hours after being circumcised, an inquest was
            told. Celian Noumbiwe was operated on in 2007 at a
            doctor&rsquo;s surgery in Reading but later his parents
            opened his nappy and found a &ldquo;huge amount&rdquo;
            of blood.<br />
            <br />
             Recording a narrative verdict, the Berkshire Coroner
            criticised the lack of advice given to the couple on
            postoperative care, noting that the emergency number
            given to them did not work. After the surgery, Carole
            Youmby and her partner, Monthe Bautrel, originally from
            France, were encouraged to leave the surgery with the
            baby within ten minutes when he should have been
            observed for longer, the court was told. Ms Youmby said
            that she had been told that the child&rsquo;s nappy
            should not be changed for four hours. After calling the
            emergency number several times, the couple decided to
            call their GP in the morning. The next day, February
            22, 2007, the child was taken from his home in Slough
            to the nearby <a

             target="_blank">Wexham Park Hospital</a> where he died
            in his mother&rsquo;s arms.</p>
