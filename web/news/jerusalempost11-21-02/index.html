            <p>By <a href="mailto:editors@jpost.co.il">HILARY LEILA
            KRIEGER</a></p>

            <p>A small but growing number of Israelis are
            vociferously opposed to circumcision while the majority
            of the population, from secular through to Orthodox,
            believe the brit-mila ceremony is an essential element
            of Jewish culture and religion.</p>

            <p>Udi weighed his choices carefully. On the one hand,
            he could inflict what he considered irreparable damage
            and suffering on his newborn son. On the other, he
            could inflict enduring shame and pain on his father. He
            could sever a small flap of skin from his baby's penis;
            or he could sever his relationship with his parent.</p>

            <p>"It was [either] hurting my father or hurting my
            child," the Tel Aviv-based hi-tech worker recalls. "I
            decided my father could live with this. My child I'm
            not willing to harm."</p>

            <p>So Udi did what a marginal but increasing number of
            Israelis are doing: He opted not to circumcise his
            son.</p>

            <p>On the eighth day after his grandson's birth, Udi's
            father rang to ask if his grandson had been circumcised
            and if his son understood the consequences of his
            choice. Udi replied that he did. His parents didn't
            phone him for the next two years.</p>

            <p>"I expected them [my parents] to shun me and I was
            willing to pay that price."</p>

            <p>The excommunication lasted until the birth of
            another child, this time a girl. Cajoled by family,
            Udi's parents took the opportunity just a few months
            ago to break their silence and visit their new
            granddaughter.</p>

            <p>Now, Udi says, "My father even shakes my hand. But
            there is a wall between us. He won't hug me as he used
            to."</p>

            <p>Though Udi's father is secular like himself, Udi
            understood his grief: "His son, the one he raised,
            crossed the line and did something unthinkable, and he
            was so ashamed. I really felt for him."</p>

            <p>The experience, says Udi's wife Ronit, who asked
            that the family's last name not be used, was the worst
            among the 200 couples who form the support group she
            started two and a half years ago for parents who choose
            not to perform a brit mila. After the initial shock and
            anger, most parents generally accept their children's
            decision. But that doesn't mean it's easy to withstand
            the societal pressure to circumcise - as almost all
            Israeli parents of boys do perform the ceremony - which
            is largely what prompted Ronit to form <a
            href="http://www.kahal.org/"
            target="_blank">Kahal</a>, or Parents' Group for Whole
            Children.</p>

            <p>The pressure to conform propels droves of parents
            who would otherwise reject the ritual to go through
            with it, according to Rani Kasher of Rosh Pina. He
            produces a Hebrew-language publication, <a
            href="http://www.af-mila.org.il/"
            target="_blank">Af-Mila</a> (which can mean both "No
            circumcision" and "Say nothing"), for parents who are
            considering skipping the snipping.</p>

            <p>He began the periodical because most of the initial
            information he found on the subject was in English and
            not readily available in Hebrew. Countries such as the
            US have well-established anti-circumcision movements in
            which Jews often play prominent roles.</p>

            <p>Kasher says, "I don't see any reason why I should
            cut my son's genitals. There is no reason and I don't
            think I have the right, even as a parent, to cut a
            normal part of his body just because other people do
            it."</p>

            <p>Cultural pressure persuaded Hanoch Ben-Yami, a
            philosophy professor at <a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/"
            target="_blank">Tel Aviv University</a>, to circumcise
            his son after his birth three years ago even though he
            had previously attacked the practice in the Hebrew
            press.</p>

            <p>His wife, he explains, worried about how society
            would treat him. But it turns out a neighborhood
            kindergarten had three uncircumcised boys last year and
            two now.</p>

            <p>"Nothing of the sort would have been imaginable five
            or 10 years ago, so we can see things have really
            changed," he says.</p>

            <p>Kasher thinks that's only just the beginning, even
            though right now his movement is a fringe one. He
            foresees a time when the practice will be relegated to
            history books. "Eventually I think religious people,
            too, will stop doing it. But it will take years."</p>

            <p>But perhaps not in Europe. If certain members of the
            Swedish parliament get their way, theirs will become
            the first country to outlaw the procedure. A bill
            introduced in the nation's Riksdag last month would
            forbid circumcision on any boy under the age of 15
            except in cases of medical necessity.</p>

            <p>"Hopefully they will succeed and they will be the
            first nation in the world to recognize circumcision for
            what it is - a crime," enthuses Avshalom
            Zoossmann-Diskin, who leads the Israeli Association
            Against Genital Mutilation.</p>

            <p>He hopes other European countries will follow
            Sweden's lead, even though, he says, "You don't have to
            outlaw circumcision because it's already illegal to cut
            any organ from a minor if they don't want or need it
            done."</p>

            <p>Rabbi Philip Spectre, who leads the Conservative <a
            href="http://www.bethjudea.org/Lifshitz_files/greatsynagoguestockholm.html"
             target="_blank">Great Synagogue</a> in Stockholm,
            thinks differently. "Changing the law and making it
            impossible to circumcise our children at eight days old
            is an infringement of religious rights."</p>

            <p>He has organized an effort to counter the proposal,
            since he says the Jewish community was "blind-sided" by
            a law passed last summer requiring anesthetics and a
            medical professional accompanying the brit-mila
            surgery.</p>

            <p>"A law like that does not bode well for the ability
            of Jews to practice ritual freely in Europe," says
            Rabbi Andrew Sacks, director of the Conservative <a
            href="http://www.masorti.org/mason/about/rabbinical.html"
             target="_blank">Rabbinical Assembly of Israel</a> and
            a practicing mohel, of the proposal. He points out that
            few people in Sweden perform circumcisions except those
            who do so for religious reasons - Jews and Muslims.</p>

            <p>Spectre stresses that he doesn't see anti-Semitism
            as the main motivation for the proposed bill.</p>

            <p>"There's a very strong feeling in Sweden that the
            Swedish people and government should be at the
            forefront of [protecting] rights, especially children's
            rights," he says. The law passed after a local Muslim
            boy died from complications from medication
            administered in connection with a circumcision.</p>

            <p>"It might also be coming from a not-so-elegant
            reason - that in Sweden, the newcomers, the immigrants
            are viewed with suspicion," Spectre adds.</p>

            <p>"These things often do have anti-Semitic elements
            involved," says Michael Meyer, a visiting professor of
            Jewish history at the <a
            href="http://www.huji.ac.il/unew/main.html"
            target="_blank">Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a>.
            "This is happening in Sweden at a time that there is a
            lot of anti-Israel sentiment, which is often
            anti-Semitic."</p>

            <p>But even the hint of anti-Semitic reasons for the
            bill's proposal angers Zoossmann-Diskin.</p>

            <p>"They cry anti-Semitism and this is the end of the
            discussion," he says. "It allows them not to deal with
            the issue of mutilation and the right to have an intact
            body."</p>

            <p>The issue, according to opponents of circumcision,
            includes the moral ramifications of cutting one's child
            and the psychological impacts stemming from the trauma.
            They claim that the level of discomfort experienced by
            the child increases his later response to pain and
            hurts the bond between the baby and his mother. They
            also maintain that circumcision diminishes sexual
            pleasure and that there is no medical reason to remove
            the foreskin.</p>

            <p>But Dr. Orly Prat, who heads the urology services at
            Jerusalem's Bikur Holim Hospital, recommends the
            procedure on medical grounds - though he advocates
            using a mohel rather than a doctor to perform the
            operation since mohels specialize in only one kind of
            surgery.</p>

            <p>Prat points to lower rates of penile cancer, urinary
            infections, and communication of sexually transmitted
            diseases - notably HIV - in circumcised men.</p>

            <p>He dismisses suggestions of reduced sexual sensation
            or lasting psychological damage from the pain. He says
            that in the course of a year, he usually sees only one
            case in which an infant requires serious medical
            attention because of mistakes made during
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>Americans - who unlike Europeans routinely practice
            non-religious circumcision - perform the operation on
            approximately 60 percent of the male population, down
            from nearly 90 percent a generation or two ago.</p>

            <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics does not
            recommend routine circumcision but in 1995 <span
            class="cirp">[CIRP Note: actually 1999]</span> noted
            there are some medical benefits and that it's
            legitimate for parents to take religious and cultural
            traditions into account when deciding on the
            procedure.</p>

            <p>Meyer, also a professor at the Reform <a
            href="http://www.huc.edu/" target="_blank">Hebrew Union
            College</a>, says the arguments boil down to one bottom
            line: "Over many, many centuries, boys have undergone
            this ritual, this operation, and there has not in fact
            been serious damage to them."</p>

            <p>Spectre disputes the contention that brit mila
            causes lasting psychological harm, quipping, "Jewish
            women are just as neurotic as Jewish men."</p>

            <p>And Sacks acknowledges that medical justification
            for circumcision is scant - but that it's not the
            point.</p>

            <p>"I do not at all suggest that it's healthier to be
            circumcised," he says. "But the claims of brit mila
            being barbaric, the claims of being unaesthetic, the
            claims of pain are all secondary, even if they were
            true. The bottom line is that it's a mitzva."</p>

            <p>Noting the medical arguments on both sides, Orthodox
            rabbi Seth Farber of Jerusalem says, either way,
            "There's something very powerful about making a
            physical statement about the covenant that every man
            has with God."</p>

            <p>In that covenant, according to Chapter 17 of
            Genesis, God promises to make Abraham's people many and
            mighty and demands that Abraham and his offspring do
            the following: "You shall circumcise the flesh of your
            foreskin, and that shall be the sign of the covenant
            between Me and you. And throughout the generations,
            every male among you shall be circumcised at the age of
            eight days."</p>

            <p>Farber explains that the religious concept behind
            the act is that "a covenant of the flesh is symbolic of
            a covenant of the heart ... By cutting, it really
            demonstrates that there are two sides to a covenant."
            The dual aspects signify that responsibility goes both
            ways, and that man must take an active role in the
            world around him.</p>

            <p>"It is a way in which man perfects the body. Man
            perfects what God has given," he says. "Man can't sit
            aside and wait for God to do everything."</p>

            <p>He adds that it's also an act of cultural
            significance. "I'm making a statement of dedication
            toward my ancestors," Farber explains. "It's a very
            profound statement that I bind myself to that ancestral
            tradition, and that's what being part of tradition is
            all about. I'm not just bonding myself to a ritual that
            my contemporaries and peers think is important."</p>

            <p>Ronit, co-founder of Kahal, gives a different
            rationale for the ritual's staying power even among
            secular Jews who have abandoned other trappings of
            tradition: "Everything else is gone. Shabbat is gone.
            Kashrut is gone. So they hold onto this thing, because
            it's easy to hold onto... You only have to do it once,
            and you do it to someone else. It's like paying a bill
            to someone. Once you've paid, you're free to go."</p>

            <p>But Emma Youval, a Jerusalemite whose firstborn son
            was circumcised last year, says it was precisely the
            sense of connection Farber describes that struck her
            during the ceremony.</p>

            <p>"From a cultural point of view, I felt that I was
            reaching back through the generations to biblical
            history and connecting with the forefathers and
            -mothers.</p>

            <p>"Each mother all the way back through history had
            had to hand over her child to someone who was going to
            cut it, to mutilate it basically, and you had to have
            this faith," says Youval.</p>

            <p>She admits that "it was scary," but says she never
            considered not performing the ritual, "which in the end
            means: 'That's it. He's a member of the community and
            he can never deny it and the community can never deny
            it.'"</p>

            <p>That identification explains its nearly universal
            appeal, according to Meyer. "There's a tremendous
            symbolic significance to brit mila and I think people
            recognize that not only in Israel but in the Diaspora
            as well," he says. "This is recognized as a mark of
            distinction of being a Jew."</p>

            <p>Those opposed to circumcision, though, maintain the
            opposite.</p>

            <p>"It's not something unique to Jews. Muslims
            circumcise their sons. In the States more than half the
            population is circumcised," says Ben-Yami. "It's not
            something that distinguishes a Jew from a non-Jew."</p>

            <p>Cultures throughout the ancient Middle East -
            including those of Egypt and Syria - practiced the
            custom. Today Muslims also circumcise, though often at
            a later age than Jews.</p>

            <p>But Farber says that does not detract from the
            ritual.</p>

            <p>"This is a great example of a tradition we actually
            share with the Arabs," he says. "Maybe this is an
            opportunity for bonding instead of hatred... It can be
            the basis of shared dialogue."</p>

            <p>And indeed, the Swedish Jewish community has begun
            to work with the local Muslim population to combat the
            anti-circumcision bill.</p>

            <p>"We are cooperating with the Muslims in order to
            form a united front," Spectre explains, noting the
            communities have begun to share information and
            coordinate their efforts.</p>

            <p>Spectre has set up a Web site and devised an action
            plan which includes lobbying the government and
            soliciting help from world Jewry.</p>

            <p>Willy Sallomon of Kfar Saba, who used to be the
            chairman of the Jewish community in Stockholm and
            spends part of each year in Sweden, praised Spectre's
            efforts, but says the bill has little chance of
            becoming law. He explains that the private bill was
            initiated by two parliament members and would need to
            pass through a series of committees before being
            recommended to the government. At that point, the
            government would be able to choose whether to submit it
            for binding approval.</p>

            <p>Sallomon doubts that will happen, given that the
            circumcision law passed last year stipulates the
            practice be reviewed in four years, not one. In
            addition, bill sponsors Marietta de Pourbaix-Lundin and
            Inger Rene come from the conservative Moderate Party,
            currently in opposition to the ruling Social
            Democrats.</p>

            <p>Though many Israeli circumcision critics think such
            a legal prohibition is untenable in this country, four
            years ago Zoossmann-Diskin's group attempted to do
            exactly that. His association unsuccessfully petitioned
            the <a
            href="http://62.90.71.124/mishpat/html/en/home/index.html">
            High Court of Justice</a>, claiming that circumcision
            is in contravention of the Basic Law: <a
            href="http://www.oefre.unibe.ch/law/icl/is12000_.html"

            <p>Zoossmann-Diskin has no sons and therefore hasn't
            had to make a decision regarding brit mila as a
            parent.</p>

            <p>"I'm talking as a victim," he explains.</p>

            <p>His anti-circumcision feelings were sparked by
            witnessing a relative's circumcision in 1981.</p>

            <p>"I decided after this event that I'm not going to
            attend any more of these atrocious ceremonies."</p>

            <p>But to Jason Kurtz, a student at the Otniel hesder
            yeshiva, watching a brit is a positive experience. He
            notes that after the baby cries, he is put in the arms
            of a loving parent - an act of symbolic meaning and
            actual reassurance.</p>

            <p>"When you get hurt, you have your community around
            you to support you and care for you."</p>

            <p>He rejects the idea that the ritual victimizes those
            who undergo it.</p>

            <p>"I'm here. I've lived through a brit mila, so I
            don't feel traumatized by it. I'd feel really robbed if
            I hadn't had it.</p>

            <p>"It's one of the strongest identity marks of being a
            Jew. If you talk about being Jewish, that's one of the
            things that's synonymous with who we are as a people
            and our relationship with God," he explains. "I want to
            be a Jew. I'm really proud to be Jewish and I don't
            want that taken away from me."</p>

            <p>Udi says his opposition to circumcision doesn't stem
            from shame or disinterest in being Jewish.</p>

            <p>"I'm a proud part of Judaism... I'm proud enough to
            be part of the tribe without cutting a part of my
            child's penis."</p>

            <p>He and Ronit consider themselves secular but still
            celebrate some Jewish holidays and teach their children
            the fundamentals of the religion. Ronit stresses that
            their stance is not anti-religious.</p>

            <p>"I'm not against Judaism. We love the [Jewish]
            things we do."</p>

            <p>For Kurtz, though, the decision not to circumcise
            connotes a rejection of Jewish identity.</p>

            <p>"It's a statement that being Jewish is not important
            in your life or who you are," he says. "I think it's
            outrageous. I think it's spitting in the face of the
            Jewish people. That's pretty harsh, but that's what it
            feels like."</p>

            <p>Circumcision "is an essential part of being Jewish,"
            Kurtz adds, noting that Jews were killed by the Romans
            for violating laws prohibiting the practice.</p>

            <p>Ben-Yami counters that "Jewish identity can survive
            without circumcision, in fact, even better without it
            because more and more non-religious Jews have an
            aversion [to the religion] because of some of the
            things it contains, like circumcision. Judaism has
            enough content in it to survive without
            circumcision."</p>

            <p>"It's something that came into Judaism from other
            religions and other tribal [customs] and it will pass
            from Judaism [too]," Udi says.</p>

            <p>Kasher of Af-Mila agrees. Though he acknowledges
            that his opinions are minority ones, he points to
            growing interest in his publication and awareness of
            the subject in the media, as well as the quick increase
            from four founding families in Kahal to its current
            size.</p>

            <p>"It's going to vanish by itself, from the people,"
            he says.</p>

            <p>Kurtz, however, says the tradition is here to stay.
            He says that people throughout history have expected
            Judaism to die out but it hasn't.</p>

            <p>"There's a reason why it hasn't happened and these
            rituals are part of the reason. When you think about
            what happened to the Jewish people in the last 2,000
            years, it's a miracle that we're here now, and there's
            no rational way that people from 2,000 years ago to 100
            years ago would believe that the Jewish people would be
            a nation in this place."</p>

            <p>The assumption that circumcision will gradually
            disappear is flawed, he says. "It seems to be
            neglecting the obvious power of our own history."</p>

            <p><b>Fulfilling the commandment</b> - According to
            Norm Cohen, the Michigan director of the National
            Organization of Circumcision Information Resource
            Centers (<a href="http://www.nocirc.org/"
            target="_blank">NOCIRC</a>), the ritual of circumcision
            boils down to one thing: "It's really about, 'When I go
            to the Jewish community center and I put on a swimming
            suit, will I look like the other men?' What does that
            have to do with God? What does that have to do with the
            covenant?"</p>

            <p>His answer - nothing - prompted him to create an
            alternative to the brit mila, one in which the
            "painful, harmful, and dangerous" aspects of removing
            the foreskin have nothing to do with welcoming a child
            into the Jewish community.</p>

            <p>His "brit shalom" <a href="/pages/cultural/bris_shalom.html">ceremony</a> takes its textual
            direction from the verse in Leviticus, "And the Lord
            said, 'You shall not make cuttings in your flesh for
            the dead, nor imprint any marks upon you.' "</p>

            <p>After declaring that "the covenant between God and
            the Jewish people will continue after the symbolic
            token, circumcision, is abandoned," the ceremony
            continues with familiar prayers and customs - such as
            blessing a glass of wine and prominently featuring a
            sandak (someone who holds the baby during the event) -
            performed with a twist that emphasizes the baby's
            perfect form, sans circumcision.</p>

            <p>Brit shalom, also called an alternative brit, brit
            b'li mila (covenant without cutting) or brit haim
            (covenant of life), is practiced among Jews - primarily
            in America - who oppose circumcising their children, or
            who think that since the traditional practice only
            welcomes males into the covenant, it's sexist.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.machar.org/rabbi.html"
            target="_blank">Benjamin Biber</a>, a Washington-based
            rabbi of the <a href="http://www.shj.org/affhome.html"
            target="_blank">Humanistic Judaism</a> movement,
            routinely performs such alternative baby-namings. The
            circumcision ceremony "privileges the male and [makes]
            the male child the one of special religious interest
            for the culture. We are equal, so we just do
            baby-naming ceremonies that view male and female
            children as equal, just as male and female adults are
            equal," he says.</p>

            <p>The movement, which began in Detroit in 1969, claims
            50,000 members worldwide, including in Israel. It aims
            to "create a meaningful Jewish lifestyle free from
            supernatural authority and imposed tradition,"
            according to its Web site.</p>

            <p>"Because our movement is humanistic, we don't
            believe in a covenant between humanity and a deity. We
            believe in a covenant between human beings," Biber
            explains.</p>

            <p>In April, the <a href="http://www.lcshj.org/"
            target="_blank">Leadership Conference of Secular and
            Humanistic Jews</a> issued a <a
            href="http://www.lcshj.org/circum.html"
            target="_blank">statement on circumcision</a> stating
            that "circumcision is not required for Jewish
            identity."</p>

            <p>The leadership's statement continues, "We support
            parents making informed decisions whether or not to
            circumcise their sons. We affirm their right to choose,
            and we accept and respect their choice. Naming and
            welcoming ceremonies should be egalitarian. We
            recommend separating circumcision from welcoming
            ceremonies."</p>

            <p>Biber says he personally opposes circumcision and
            won't preside over a naming ceremony done in connection
            with the procedure. "I'm a naturalist so I believe that
            the human body is quite functional on its own, and
            cutting bits off is not a good idea."</p>

            <p>In Israel, the movement doesn't have the same formal
            structures and community orientation. Its leaders focus
            on providing education in Jewish history, culture, and
            traditions in way that's accessible to secular people.
            They teach religious ritual only as a part of Jewish
            experience, not for personal practice, and like their
            American colleagues believe the decision to circumcise
            should be left with the parents.</p>

            <p>Ya'acov Malkin, who founded and serves as the
            academic director of <a
            href="http://www.meitar.org.il/">MEITAR</a>, the
            College of Judaism as Culture, says of circumcision: "I
            don't regard it as a religious act at all... if it's
            medically not necessary, it's not necessary."</p>

            <p>He circumcised his own son 50 years ago "because of
            habit, because it was a custom, it is a custom of the
            Jews."</p>

            <p>He says that he was raised a "free Jew" by his
            family of atheists before moving to Eretz Yisrael in
            1934, when he was seven.</p>

            <p>This upbringing, and his recognition that a large
            number of secular Israelis grow up without a way to
            interact positively with their culture, having been
            alienated by a strictly observant lifestyle, encouraged
            him to change the situation.</p>

            <p>His college teaches classes on classical Jewish
            texts as well as modern ones, such as works by Amos Oz,
            Franz Kafka, and Martin Buber.</p>

            <p>To the suggestion that Free Judaism is Judaism
            without God, he replies: "It does include God of
            course, because God is one of the most important
            literary heroes in all the Jewish literature, in all
            literature."</p>

            <p>A group of 35 American Jews that claims members from
            secular to Orthodox tries to find ways of reconciling
            Judaism to a circumcision-free life. The organization,
            <a href="http://www.jewsagainstcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Jews Against Circumcision</a>, was
            started, as founder Gillian Flato of California puts
            it, because information against the practice "must come
            from within."</p>

            <p>Brought up Conservative and now a Reform Jew, Flato
            says that what makes you Jewish is whether your mother
            is Jewish, not whether you are circumcised.</p>

            <p>Besides, "There's a lot of contradiction in
            Halacha," Flato says. "Part of Halacha says you cannot
            harm another person. But ripping off the foreskin is
            harming another person."</p>

            <p>Flato goes further in her challenge of traditional
            Jewish precept when she points out that in the
            discussion of the covenant in Genesis, God tells
            Abraham "I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I
            will make nations of you, and kings shall come out of
            you," in return for Abraham's circumcising of his sons
            and slaves.</p>

            <p>She says that Jews only comprise one half of one
            percent of the world's population, that kings of the
            Jews have been few in number, and that "we don't have a
            land of our own because we've been fighting the
            Palestinians forever and there's all kinds of turmoil
            there."</p>

            <p>She concludes, "Some would argue that God's not
            fulfilled his part of the covenant, so why should we
            fulfill our part by continuing to mutilate our sons'
            penises?"</p>

            <p><b>A snip at a time</b> - Andrew Sacks's work has
            taken him to the sandy white beaches of Greece, the
            fast-paced streets of Hong Kong, and the cracked dirt
            roads of Uganda. Is his the jet-setting life of a
            travel writer? A corporate magnate? A spy? No. It's
            that of a professional mohel from Israel.</p>

            <p>He explains that populations throughout southern and
            Eastern Europe need someone to help perform
            circumcisions on newborns and carry out conversion
            ceremonies, while expats living in East Asia have no
            local ritual circumciser. And in Uganda, 200 members of
            the Abayudaya tribe wanted to undergo brit mila to
            halachicly sanctify the Jewish life they've led for
            nearly a century.</p>

            <p>Sacks arrived in their small village last winter
            full of skepticism about the Jewish pretensions of the
            community.</p>

            <p>"Everybody thinks they're part of the lost tribes
            these days," he says.</p>

            <p>According to the community, the tribe has been
            living as Jews ever since their leader Semei Kakungulu
            introduced them to the religion in 1919 after reading
            the Old Testament. When Sacks saw that they kept Jewish
            customs including immersing in a mikve and practicing
            circumcision, his doubts vanished.</p>

            <p>Since the males had already had their foreskins
            removed - though not, as Halacha requires, by a Jew -
            he merely performed a symbolic brit mila. The men
            formed a long line leading from a small hut perched on
            a mud floor in which Sacks and the village's roaming
            chickens waited. One by one the local men went in and
            out, receiving a small nick along the scar of their
            circumcision accompanied by the necessary
            blessings.</p>

            <p>Not all of the cultural surprises Sacks has
            experienced in his 20 years as a mohel have taken place
            outside the country.</p>

            <p>At an Israeli brit, a woman at the ceremony asked
            Sacks if she could have the foreskin to swallow because
            she had heard the legend that doing so helps a barren
            woman conceive. He told her that a sip of the wine
            blessed during the circumcision would be as effective,
            so she drank the liquid instead.</p>

            <p>Sacks says he generally buries the removed skins in
            his geranium garden, since the tradition is to inter
            them like any other part of the body. Some Diaspora
            mohels use a tin with Israeli soil inside so that the
            foreskin can be "buried in Israel."</p>

            <p>The 3,000 circumcisions that Sacks estimates he's
            performed have ranged from ceremonies on secular
            kibbutzim (in which he often has to mumble the prayers
            to himself because the parents don't want to observe
            the rite's religious aspects) to flashy
            affairs-cum-discos in suburbs to hospital operations
            for new immigrants.</p>

            <p>In one case he performed a circumcision on a
            76-year-old Russian who had just made aliya.</p>

            <p>"He had a smile on his face the whole time he
            underwent the circumcision."</p>

            <p>The emotions of those experiencing the brit mila -
            parents and children - are not always so positive.
            There's even a debate among the Ashkenazim about
            whether to say the Sheheheyanu prayer that's recited at
            all happy occasions.</p>

            <p>"Is a brit a happy occasion or not because there's
            pain for the child?" Sacks asks.</p>

            <p>The answer differs within Israel, where the blessing
            is said, and without, where it's not.</p>

            <p>SACKS RELATES that though women are more visibly
            affected by the event than men - often crying or
            leaving the room - he's only seen men faint. Usually
            it's an uncle or cousin, says Sacks. He has never seen
            a father pass out although one became sweaty, fell
            over, and cut his head on a piece of furniture, "but
            never went unconscious."</p>

            <p>While that happened, Sacks kept to the task at hand.
            "I'm very focused on what I'm doing," he says. "If
            there's a sonic boom, or, as often happens, a cellphone
            rings, it doesn't faze me."</p>

            <p>Unlike the rabbi played by Ben Stiller in Keeping
            the Faith, Sacks has never himself fainted at a brit
            mila, but he does admit that he was sweating and his
            knees were shaking the first time he performed the
            operation. He trained for a year and a half before he
            commandeered the knife on his own, first observing and
            then assisting before being left in charge.</p>

            <p>Learning to be a ritual circumciser is quite
            difficult, he says, because most mohels don't want to
            teach anyone for fear of their disciples homing in on
            their business. He only received instruction because he
            lived in Pennsylvania at the time and his teacher knew
            he would make aliya soon.</p>

            <p>In Israel, he says, mohels will typically only teach
            non-Israelis out of the same fear of competition.</p>

            <p>The profession here is traditionally passed down
            from father to son, with few outsiders being allowed to
            learn the skill. Additional barriers are presented to
            anyone not Orthodox, says Sacks, himself a Conservative
            rabbi.</p>

            <p>Those on the receiving end can also face hurdles,
            particularly new immigrants without the resources to
            afford the surgery - a much more costly affair if done
            on an adult because it necessitates a hospital visit
            and attending physician.</p>

            <p>Sacks works with an organization called Keren Habrit
            dedicated to defraying the cost of circumcision for
            anyone who faces financial difficulty, save those who
            request the procedure for cosmetic reasons.</p>

            <p>But in affluent communities such as the small group
            of expatriate Jews who live in Hong Kong, parents are
            often willing to pay exorbitant amounts for a brit mila
            - upwards of the $1,600 the plane ticket from Israel
            costs. Because the ceremony needs to be performed by a
            Jew and there's no one trained in the procedure there,
            families will fly Sacks in to carry out the
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>"There's clearly a greater emotional attachment to
            [brit mila] than any other mitzva," Sacks says. "No one
            spends that kind of money on a succa. For that amount
