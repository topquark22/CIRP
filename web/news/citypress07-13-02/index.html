            <p>I never thought the sadism that accompanies the
            custom of initiation today would come so close to me.
            This week my mother-in-law discovered the old man who
            used to look after her livestock had died. He was
            abducted to attend an intiation school by men young
            enough to be his grandsons.</p>

            <p>How do you initiate a 77-year-old man into
            manhood?</p>

            <p>Simeon Bosbok of Madibogo village near Mafikeng died
            last weekend in what appears to have been a cruel
            death. He was secretly buried but his body has since
            been exhumed. Police say it had the marks of severe
            bruising.</p>

            <p>Bosbok is not alone. We have heard far too many
            stories of <span class="yellow">abductions, deaths of
            initiates, botched circumcisions and penile
            amputations</span>. All this happens in the name of
            culture, in the name of producing socially-responsible
            men.</p>

            <p>What puzzles me is the apparent lack of political
            will to deal with this outrage.</p>

            <p>I have said it before and repeat: it is absolute
            rubbish, and the height of backwardness, to subject
            boys and men to pain and emotional trauma because you
            want them to achieve responsible manhood.</p>

            <p>Manhood is more than just forcibly removing the
            foreskin of young boys. There are boys whose parents
            left their penises intact and who turned out to be
            model men and fathers. And then there are a few
            circumcised twits who've been to initiation schools but
            whose understanding of manhood leaves a lot to be
            desired.</p>

            <p>The sooner those who still adhere to this custom
            realise there is no correlation between a mountain
            school and manhood, the quicker we can stop this
            madness.</p>
