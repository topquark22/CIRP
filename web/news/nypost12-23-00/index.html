      <h2>SERVICEMAN SUES OVER DOC'S 'UNKIND' CUT AT BIRTH</h2>
      <b>by Christopher Francescan</b> 

      <p>An 18-year-old Air Force private is suing the doctor and
      hospital responsible for circumcising him at birth, saying
      the operation caused him excruciating pain as an infant and
      lasting sexual harm. William Stowell's suit in Brooklyn
      federal court claims his mother was drugged when she signed
      the consent form.</p>

      <p>He says his pain threshold has been reduced and his
      ability to sexually satisfy women has been unalterably
      harmed. He wants $75,000 in damage. Stowell, who says he
      doesn't recall the pain he suffered as an infant, recalls
      becoming aware of his condition at a children's camp at age
      14, when he saw another boy's uncircumcised penis in a group
      shower. "I wanted to know why he had one and I didn't - and,
      more importantly, where mine was," said Stowell, who now
      lives in Roanoke, VA.</p>

      <p>His lawyer, <a target="_blank"
      href="http://firms.findlaw.com//llewellynlaw/practices.htm">David
      Llewellyn</a>, is an anti-circumcision advocate who claims to
      have won settlements in a half-dozen similar cases in the
      past five years. A spokesman for <a target="_blank"
      href="http://wehealny.org/patients/lich_description.html">Long
      Island College Hospital</a> declined to comment and Dr. Frank
      Cariello, who no longer works at the hospital, could not be
      reached. Stowell's mother, Linda, said she was mortified when
      she brought her boy home and realized he'd been
      circumcised.</p>

      <p>"But what could you possibly do?" she said, "There's not
      any way you can put something like that back on once it's
      gone."</p>
