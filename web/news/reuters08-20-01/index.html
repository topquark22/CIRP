      <h2>UK doctors given guidelines on female circumcision</h2>

      <p><b>LONDON, Aug 20 (Reuters Health)</b> -- Doctors in the
      UK have been urged to take firm action to protect girls from
      female genital mutilation.</p>

      <p>In <a
      href="http://www.bma.org.uk/public/ethics.nsf/39f32339ff78cd6b802566a6003f3311/5bdfdc005032fc6780256a39004aa85b?OpenDocument">
      guidelines</a> published on Monday, the British Medical
      Association (<a href="http://www.bma.org.uk/">BMA</a>) called
      on doctors to involve social services or invoke child
      protection proceedings if families insist on having girls
      circumcised.</p>

      <p>The publication follows an increase in the number of
      immigrants arriving in the UK from Africa, in particular
      Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia, where the practice is
      common.</p>

      <p>The BMA has urged doctors to deal with any circumcision
      requests sensitively and to be aware of cultural differences.
      But it has told doctors to make it clear to families that the
      practice is illegal in the UK and that steps will be taken to
      prevent the families from going ahead with the procedure.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.who.int/home-page/">World Health
      Organisation</a> estimates that 138 million women worldwide
      have been circumcised. There are many different types of
      genital mutilation, involving partial or total removal of the
      clitoris or labia minora. The most extreme form is
      'infibulation,' where all of a girl or young woman's external
      genitalia are removed with the remainder being stitched
      together, leaving a matchstick-sized opening for the passage
      of urine or menstrual blood.</p>

      <p>Mutilation is carried out for many different reasons, from
      hygiene and aesthetics to protecting virginity and enhancing
      male sexual pleasure.</p>

      <p>While there are no figures for the number of women in the
      UK who have undergone the procedure, support groups estimate
      that it could total as many as 70,000.</p>

      <p>The Foundation for Women's Health Research and Development
      (<a href="http://www.forward.dircon.co.uk/">FORWARD</a>),
      which campaigns against female genital mutilation, believes
      that between 3,000 and 4,000 girls in the UK are at risk of
      being circumcised every year.</p>

      <p>Professor Vivienne Nathanson, the BMA's head of ethics,
      said doctors must warn families of the risks of female
      circumcision. 'Female genital mutilation is a practice that
      causes girls and women serious health and psychological
      problems for life,' Nathanson said in a statement.</p>

      <p>'There is no doubt that parents agree to the practice with
      the best interests of their daughters at heart but doctors
      must work with families to show them that by agreeing to this
      procedure they are causing them untold harm and damage,' she
      added.</p>

      <p>A spokeswoman for FORWARD welcomed the guidelines but said
      more needed to be done to educate doctors and other health
      professionals about female circumcision.</p>

      <p>'We all definitely need to work harder to train people and
      to raise awareness of this problem. Many people say it is not
      a problem in the UK because they have not come across it. But
      it is and we need to educate them,' the spokeswoman told
      Reuters Health.</p>
