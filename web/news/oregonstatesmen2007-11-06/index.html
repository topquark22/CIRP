            <h2>Ore. high court weighs circumcision case</h2>

            <p>By WILLIAM McCALL<br />
             Associated Press Writer</p>

            <p>SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- The father of a 12-year-old boy
            told the <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/index.htm"
             target="_blank">Oregon Supreme Court</a> on Tuesday
            that circumcision is a decision best left to the
            custodial parent while his ex-wife argued a trial judge
            should have given more consideration to her concerns
            about the effect on her son.<br />
            <br />
             <a href="http://www.familylawattorney1.com/"
            target="_blank">James Boldt</a>, an attorney, argued
            his own case in a dispute that began with his
            conversion to Judaism in 2004.<br />
            <br />
             But the six justices who heard the arguments over
            whether Boldt's son should be circumcised steered clear
            of religious issues and instead focused on custody of
            the boy.<br />
            <br />
             The argument centered on whether Boldt's request to
            circumcise his son amounted to a risk to the boy's
            health that supported the mother's argument that she
            should be granted custody.<br />
            <br />
             <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/demunizbio.htm"
             target="_blank">Chief Justice Paul De Muniz</a> asked
            James Boldt whether he felt the trial judge had the
            authority to make the decision on circumcision for the
            custodial parent without hearing more about the
            concerns of the boy's mother, Lia Boldt.<br />
            <br />
             "The court is not a rubber stamp," Boldt agreed. "A
            court does not to have grant a hearing just for the
            asking."<br />
            <br />
             But <a href="http://www.claypatrick.com/"
            target="_blank">Clayton Patrick</a>, the attorney for
            Lia Boldt, argued the trial judge should have allowed
            her to present some evidence to support her health
            concerns.<br />
            <br />
             "In this case there's been a lot of talk that what
            we're trying to do is say there can never be a
            circumcision," Patrick said. "We're not saying that at
            all. ... We presented enough evidence to at least have
            a hearing."<br />
            <br />
             <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/gillettebio.htm"
             target="_blank">Justice W. Michael Gillette</a> asked
            Patrick what would happen if the noncustodial parent of
            a child objected to allowing participation in a risky
            sport, such as football, and then answered his own
            question.<br />
            <br />
             "The answer to that is that's preposterous," Gillette
            said. "In fact more people get hurt playing football
            than from having a circumcision - a lot more, and a lot
            more seriously."<br />
            <br />
             At some point, Gillette suggested, parents cannot ask
            a court to substitute its opinion for their own
            judgment.<br />
            <br />
             Gillette also suggested Lia Boldt was using
            circumcision as a means to exert control over her son
            after custody was granted to her ex-husband.<br />
            <br />
             "Your client has been at her former husband's throat,
            and he at hers, before this court, among other places,
            over the last - let's see - nine years," Gillette told
            Patrick.<br />
            <br />
             "The suggestion to me that, quote - 'legitimate
            concerns' - close quote arise under these circumstances
            just starts to ring hollow after awhile," Gillette
            said. "These people are fighting with each other and
            whether it's legitimate or not is lost in the
            noise."<br />
            <br />
             The comments were echoed by Steve Freeman, attorney
            for the <a href="http://www.adl.org/"
            target="_blank">Anti-Defamation League</a>, one of
            several national Jewish groups which filed friend of
            the court briefs to support the father.<br />
            <br />
             "Circumcision is being used as a weapon in an ugly
            custody fight," Freeman said.<br />
            <br />
             Rabbi Daniel Isaak at <a
            href="http://www.nevehshalom.org/"
            target="_blank">Congregation Neveh Shalom</a> in
            Portland, who attended the Tuesday hearing, noted that
            general medical opinion on whether to circumcise tends
            to go back and forth, like fashion. But the practice
            has been an article of faith for Jews for thousands of
            years.<br />
            <br />
             John Geisheker, executive director of <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>, a
            Seattle-based group, said after the hearing that he
            hoped the court would consider the child's rights
            before making any decision.<br />
            <br />
             "The child deserves a hearing," Geisheker said. "This
            is a serious procedure on a 12-year-old. Most men, I
            think, would agree."<br />
