            <i>Last Updated Wed, 11 Feb 2004 18:29:41</i> 

            <p>PENTICTON, B.C. - The parents of a newborn who died
            following circumcision surgery are pushing for
            hospitals to inform patients of the possible dangers
            associated with the removal of foreskin.</p>

            <p>Brent and Tanna McWillis's month-old son <a
            href="/news/theprovince08-29-02/">Ryleigh died in
            August 2002</a> after he suffered severe hemorrhaging
            two days after he was circumcised at <a
            href="http://www.penticton.ca/eds/hospital/page1.html"
            target="_blank">Penticton Regional Hospital</a>.</p>

            <table align="right" width="222" cellpadding="0"
            cellspacing="0" hspace="4" summary="illustration">
              <tr>
                <td><img src="cbc1.jpg" width="220" hspace="3"
                border="2" alt="hospital circumcision" /><br />
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>The parents were told that Ryleigh would experience
            some bleeding, but they didn't realize how much was too
            much.</p>

            <p>Ryleigh's death renewed debate over male
            circumcision and also caught the attention of a
            Seattle-based group called <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Doctor's Opposing Circumcision</a>.</p>

            <p>One of its members, lawyer John Geisheker, wants
            circumcision banned globally, but in the meantime, he's
            willing to compromise and has asked infants be kept in
            hospital for one day following surgery.</p>

            <p>"We would like to see there be no outpatient
            circumcisions, because those are the riskiest ones,"
            said Geisheker. "The parents, although they may be
            solicitous and loving, are not medically trained."</p>
