            <h2>Leave it to us, surgeon tells GPs</h2>

            <p>06.08.2002 - By MARTIN JOHNSTON</p>

            <p>An Auckland surgeon wants inadequately trained GPs
            to stop doing circumcisions because too many operations
            are being done badly.</p>

            <p>Paediatric surgeon Stuart Ferguson says GP
            operations have left <span>boys with infected and
            deformed-looking penises.</span></p>

            <p>At <a href="http://www.starship.org.nz/index.html"
            target="_blank">Starship children's hospital</a> in
            Auckland, surgeons repair at least 12 foreskins a year
            after doctors in the community have made mistakes.</p>

            <p>And Mr Ferguson says that might be a fraction of the
            mismanaged cases.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.rnzcgp.org.nz/"
            target="_blank">Royal New Zealand College of General
            Practitioners</a> is trying to find the GPs responsible
            and plans to write guidelines and find training for
            doctors who want to perform circumcisions.</p>

            <p>Mr Ferguson said some of the boys' penises were left
            looking "cosmetically unacceptable".</p>

            <p>"A number have infections and a number have
            significant haemorrhage."</p>

            <p>Some had too much skin removed, which might reduce
            sensation long-term.</p>

            <p>The main problem was with boys who had received a
            "dorsal slit" operation in which the foreskin is cut
            lengthways but not removed, uncovering the head of the
            penis.</p>

            <p>"It looks like Mickey Mouse with two big ears. I get
            a number of these and have to repair them when they are
            older," Mr Ferguson said.</p>

            <p>An estimated 6 per cent of males are
            circumcised.</p>

            <p>The Government pays only for circumcisions needed
            for medical reasons, such as a foreskin that is too
            tight or is frequently infected.</p>

            <p>People wanting one for religious or cultural reasons
            must pay about $1000 for a surgeon to perform it at a
            private hospital.</p>

            <p>GPs, who charge up to $300, are allowed to perform
            circumcisions.</p>

            <p>But Mr Ferguson said they should do so only after
            significantly more surgical training than was now given
            to junior doctors.</p>

            <p>A GP at Auckland's CityMed Medical Centre, Dr Gerald
            Young, said GPs could perform the operation safely if
            they were well-trained and had good facilities.</p>

            <p>A spokesman for the <a
            href="http://www.racs.edu.au/" target="_blank">Royal
            Australasian College of Surgeons</a>, John Simpson,
            said circumcision should generally be left to
            specialist surgeons.</p>

            <p>GPs' clinics mostly lacked the appropriate
            facilities.</p>

            <p>Mr Simpson, a Wellington surgeon, said he had
            repaired faulty circumcisions on several Pacific Island
            boys aged 4 to 7.</p>

            <p>They had suffered pain and infection for several
            weeks.</p>
