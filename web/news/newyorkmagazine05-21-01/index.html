      <p><b>Live and Uncut</b></p>

      <p>With circumcision rates dropping in America, some
      squeamish Jews are trying out a bloodless Bris. But is it
      kosher?</p>

      <p>BY GERSH KUNTZMAN</p>

      <p><b>A</b> man holds his newborn grandson before the crowd
      and announces that the uncircumcised tot is "whole" and
      "perfect" in God's image, says a prayer, drinks some wine,
      puts him down, and has brunch. The only knife involved is the
      one used to cut the bagels.</p>

      <p>You call <i>that</i> a Bris?</p>

      <p>It was for the kid's mom, Elizabeth Glass, a
      self-described "liberal, hippie, cultural Jew." She defied
      that most basic of Jewish tenets last month by hosting the
      cut-less "Bris Shalom." "There's no reason to hurt my child
      to prove he's Jewish," she says.</p>

      <p>While there's no hard data that Jews are turning away from
      it in droves, America's world-leading circumcision rates have
      been dropping for two decades, thanks to doctors' increasing
      ambivalence and the effects of anti-circumcision activists.
      Books such as Ronald Goldman's <i><a
      href="http://home.att.net/~jspeyrer/circum.htm">Circumcision:
      The Hidden Trauma</a></i> and Kristen and Jeffrey O'Hara's
      <i><a href="http://www.SexAsNatureIntendedIt.com/" target="_blank">Sex as
      Nature Intended It</a></i> argue against it, and groups like
      <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/" target="_blank">noharmm"</a>, <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/" target="_blank">nocirc</a>, and <a
      href="http://www.norm.org/" target="_blank">norm</a> are getting their message
      out via the Internet.</p>

      <p>"I'm busier than ever," says <a
      href="/pages/cultural/rothenberg.html">Moshe Rothenberg</a>,
      a "Jewish educator" who officiates at the sliceless
      ceremonies. He admits that three quarters of his clients are
      "not affiliated with a congregation," but describes them as
      "very committed, secular and cultural Jews" who have
      concluded that circumcision is one ritual, like sacrificing a
      lamb, for which they no longer have a use. Or, as one
      31-year-old Jewish man, who chose not to circumcise his son
      last year, explains it: "I thought about how I don't go to
      temple or keep kosher and I began to see that my original
      attachment to circumcision was arbitrary."</p>

      <p>Anti-circumcision activist Goldman said he's heard from
      "hundreds" of Jewish parents who've skipped circumcision.
      "Often, it's when they hear a child scream at a Bris, or they
      read about the 'hygiene myth,' or they just believe their
      child is perfect the way he is."</p>

      <p>It's not that rabbis aren't sympathetic. "Even I get
      chills," says Rabbi Yael Ridberg of the <a
      href="http://www.westendsynagogue.org/">West End
      Synagogue</a>. "No parents want to intentionally cause
      pain."</p>

      <p>But to the devout, Bris Shalom is an inherent
      contradiction that gropes for legitimacy in biblical
      inconsistencies or out-of-context quotes. After all,
      circumcision is nothing less than a commandment handed down
      by God himself in Genesis: "The child whose flesh of his
      foreskin is not circumcised . . . shall be cut off from his
      people."</p>

      <p>"The covenant between God and Abraham involved cutting --
      for better or worse," says Ridberg. "It is inscribed in your
      heart and in your flesh."</p>

      <p>But Elizabeth Glass -- who doesn't doubt her Jewishness --
      felt the inscription could be limited to one place: "My son's
      faith will exist in his heart, just not in his genitals."</p>
