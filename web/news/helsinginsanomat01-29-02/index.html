<h2>Prosecutor General to consider possible charges in botched circumcision case</h2>
 
<p>The <a href="http://www.oikeus.fi/vksv/2444.htm">office of the Prosecutor General</a> is considering filing charges in a case in which seven Muslim boys in the city of Kuopio had to be hospitalised last year following religiously-mandated circumcisions performed at their homes.</p> 
<p>In August last year an African-born doctor performed circumcisions according to Muslim teaching on the seven boys, who later required hospital treatment.</p> 
<p>When the case was made public, police investigated it as one of aggravated assault.</p> 
<p>One of the investigators now says that factors have come to light which mean that the actions cannot be considered aggravated. The case is being investigated as an ordinary assault.</p> 
<p>The boys' parents have been interrogated as possible suspects.</p> 
<p>The doctor who performed the operations has been abroad, and he is to be questioned in late February.</p>
