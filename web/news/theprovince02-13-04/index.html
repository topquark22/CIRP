            The Province</p>

            <p>Friday, February 13, 2004</p>

            <p>The <a href="/news/theprovince08-29-02/"
            target="_blank">tragic death of their infant son after
            a routine circumcision in August 2002</a> still haunts
            a Vernon couple -- who say they weren't properly
            informed about the signs of danger to watch out for in
            post-operative care.</p>

            <p>A coroner's report released this week into the death
            of one-month-old Ryleigh McWillis notes that the <a
            href="http://www.penticton.ca/eds/hospital/page1.html"
            target="_blank">Penticton Regional Hospital</a> where
            the circumcision was done has significantly improved
            the information pamphlet it gives out to all parents,
            and has changed both follow-up care and documentation
            for all circumcisions.</p>

            <table border="0" align="right" cellpadding="10"
            cellspacing="0" width="250" hspace="20" summary="">

            </table>

            <p class="pic">But Tanna McWillis says she and her
            husband, Brent, a medical professional who worked at
            the hospital at the time of his son's death, are
            disappointed that coroner Chico Newell made no other
            recommendations.</p>

            <p>"The coroner could have recommended that the
            hospital and doctor clearly tell parents, 'Any
            bleeding's bad,' and warn us what to look for. I didn't
            realize a baby can die from losing as little as one
            ounce of blood," McWillis said.</p>

            <p class="pic">Brent McWillis, a lab technologist,
            transferred away from the Penticton hospital after the
            death. The couple, who also have a five-year-old
            daughter, relocated to Vernon.</p>

            <p class="pic">"Brent still finds it too painful to
            talk about," said his 34-year-old wife. "The nurses
            were our friends and a couple of them who tried so hard
            to save our baby felt so badly they quit."</p>

            <p class="pic"><a href="">The Canadian Pediatric
            Society</a> takes the position that male circumcision
            exposes children to risk with no real medical
            benefits.</p>

            <p class="pic"><span class="yellow">Circumcision is no
            longer covered by medicare in Canada and the numbers of
            male babies circumcised have been rapidly dropping,
            down from a decade ago when 60 to 90 per cent of all
            male babies born in North America were routinely
            circumcised shortly after birth.</span></p>

            <p class="pic">At <a
            href="http://www.cw.bc.ca/index.asp"
            target="_blank">B.C. Children's Hospital</a>, only 180
            male babies were circumcised of the 3,656 boys born in
            2002-03 <span class="cirp">[or 4.9 percent]</span>,
            down from the 274 circumcisions done of 3,544 boys born
            the previous year <span class="cirp">[or 7.7
            percent]</span>, said hospital spokeswoman Marisa
            Nichini.</p>

            <p>Dennis Harrison of the <a
            href="http://www.courtchallenge.com/"
            target="_blank">Association for Genital Integrity</a>
            has asked <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/"
            target="_blank">Amnesty International</a> to protest
            male circumcision as "unnecessary pain and
            suffering."</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Doctors Against Circumcision</a> has
            demanded a total ban on circumcision.</p>

            <p>But circumcision is required in the Muslim and
            Jewish faiths, and Jewish mohels use a rapid and safe
            technique.</p>

            <p>Tanna McWillis herself says she and her husband
            would probably circumcise another male child.</p>

            <p>"I was told a lot of people opposed to circumcision
            would grandstand about my son's death, but we would do
            it again.</p>

            <p>"If I had been better informed on how to look after
            my baby, it would never have happened."</p>

            <p>Ryleigh Roman Bryan McWillis, born July 21, 2002,
            was a healthy, normal baby when his parents decided --
            "just because of family history," says Tanna -- to have
            him circumcised on Aug. 20.</p>

            <p>The doctor used a slightly different procedure than
            the one described in hospital pamphlets, so the
            McWillis family wasn't given written information to
            take home.</p>

            <p>Ryleigh was still bleeding at the hospital, but was
            checked by the doctor and sent home.</p>

            <p>He was fussy all that day and a diaper that evening
            was soaked with blood.</p>

            <p>"It was pinkish because it was diluted by pee and
            they hadn't told me what to watch out for," says
            Tannis.</p>

            <p>Tannis sat up all night holding Ryleigh. When Brent
            got up at 5 a.m., the baby's diaper was full of
            blood.</p>

            <p>Ryleigh's parents rushed him to the Penticton
            hospital. By noon, he had to be evacuated by air
            ambulance to B.C. Children's Hospital. Despite
            transfusions of blood, saline and antibiotics, the tiny
            baby was limp, pale and failing.</p>

            <p>Ryleigh's "prognosis was grim," notes the coroner's
            report, and his parents were told of the "seriousness
            of his situation." Despite "massive volume
            resuscitation," Ryleigh's organs and heart began to
            shut down.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">And, says his mother, "I
            unplugged his life support at 5 a.m. on the 22nd of
            August, one month and one day after he was
            born."</span></p>
