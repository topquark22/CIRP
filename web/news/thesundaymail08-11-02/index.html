            <h2>Mother's fury as boys circumcised</h2>
            ELISSA LAWRENCE 11aug02 

            <p>A MOTHER has spoken of her anguish at discovering
            her two young sons were circumcised without her
            knowledge.</p>

            <p>The woman, 27, who cannot be identified, said she
            was devastated to learn her former partner and father
            of her sons had arranged for the boys, then aged nine
            and five, to be circumcised at a Bundaberg hospital
            last October for religious reasons.</p>

            <p>The man appeared in Bundaberg Magistrates Court on
            Thursday facing charges of grievous bodily harm (for
            the circumcision). The court was told the Muslim man
            had taken his sons to hospital to have the operations
            performed while their mother was on holidays and was
            "sincere in his religious beliefs" that they should be
            circumcised.</p>

            <p>The court was also told the mother objected to the
            procedure and was involved in a Family Law Court matter
            central to the prosecution's case. But the charges were
            dropped when the prosecution revealed missing Family
            Law Court paperwork meant it was not ready to proceed
            with the case.</p>

            <p>An adjournment request was denied, forcing the
            police prosecutor to offer no evidence against the
            man.</p>

            <p>Outside court, arresting officer Detective Senior
            Constable Peter Cormack from the Gold Coast child abuse
            investigation unit said police would pursue the case
            and that charges could still be laid.</p>

            <p>The boys' mother, who now lives on the Gold Coast,
            said in a statement she believed her sons had been
            assaulted. "My sons have a right to grow into adult men
            with intact bodies and choose their own religious and
            other beliefs", she said.</p>

            <p>"If I had been in this situation with two daughters
            who were circumcised ... the Australian public would be
            outraged. Being of indigenous Australian descent, I
            understand the importance of freedom of personal
            beliefs in a multicultural society."</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.circinfo.org/"
            target="_blank">Circumcision Information Australia</a>
            spokesman Shane Peterson said circumcision was a form
            of mutilation.</p>

            <p>"For a long time Australia has had a double standard
            on male and female circumcision", he said. "Female
            circumcision is illegal yet male circumcision continues
            to be unregulated. It's morally wrong. An adult is
            surgically inflicting their religious, cosmetic or
            sexual preferences on a child.</p>

            <p>"Surgery of any kind is one of the most invasive and
            high-risk forms of medical intervention possible, and
            it should always be the last resort. In European
            countries, the permission of both parents is necessary
            before a doctor can legally perform a circumcision on
            boys."</p>
