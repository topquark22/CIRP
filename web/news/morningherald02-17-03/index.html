            <p>Boys are being circumcised unnecessarily because
            doctors do not understand that being unable to retract
            the foreskin is part of normal child development, an
            Australian survey has found.</p>

            <p>The <a
            href="http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/178_04_170203/spi10278_fm.html#CACDGBCE"
             target="_blank">study</a> found a large majority of
            circumcisions for medical reasons were performed
            because of phimosis - a condition in which scar tissue
            grows between the foreskin and the tip of the penis.
            But it concluded most cases were unlikely to be true
            phimosis, because the condition occurs rarely in
            children and almost never in boys under five.</p>

            <p><a href="mailto:skatrina@dph.uwa.edu.au">Katrina
            Spilsbury</a>, a research associate from the <a
            href="http://www.uwa.edu.au/"
            target="_blank">University of Western Australia</a>'s
            <a
            href="http://www.meddent.uwa.edu.au/dph_new/index.htm"
            target="_blank">School of Population Health</a>, found
            circumcision rates had crept up steadily since the
            early 1980s, their all-time low.</p>

            <p>For boys aged 10 to 14, rates had doubled in the
            past two decades, while they rose by two-thirds among
            five- to nine-year-olds and by one-third among the
            under-fives. During that time, phimosis was also
            increasingly likely to be cited as the reason.</p>

            <p>"If the 1999 rate remains stable, it is estimated
            that 4 per cent of all boys will be circumcised for
            phimosis by the time they reach 15 years," Dr Spilsbury
            wrote in the <i>Medical Journal of Australia</i>.</p>

            <p>"This is seven times higher than the estimated rate
            of pathological phimosis. Over half of these boys will
            be circumcised for phimosis before they reach five
            years of age, despite the condition being rare in early
            childhood."</p>

            <p>It was most likely doctors were mistaking the normal
            development of the penis for phimosis, Dr Spilsbury
            said. But it was also possible doctors were recording a
            medical reason when it was really required by parents
            for religious or cosmetic reasons.</p>

            <p><a href="mailto:Paddy.dewan@rch.org.au">Paddy
            Dewan</a>, a pediatric urologist not involved in the
            research, said parents might also be inventing symptoms
            to persuade doctors to circumcise.</p>

            <p>"Such manipulation is not surprising when dealing
            with such an emotive topic. Nor is it necessarily
            improper given the differing cultural and medical views
            on the value of circumcision," said Professor Dewan,
            from Melbourne's <a
