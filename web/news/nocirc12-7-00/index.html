      <h3>Men Scarred by Circumcision</h3>

      <p><b>University of Sydney, NSW</b> In the first study of its
      kind, researcher Tina Kimmel presented, at the Sixth
      International Symposium at the <a
      href="http://www.usyd.edu.au/" target="_blank">University of
      Sydney</a>, Australia, her preliminary findings indicating
      that penile sensitivity of intact males is 25-30% greater
      than that of circumcised males.</p>

      <p>Using the Semmes-Weinstein Sensory Evaluator, Kimmel
      discovered that "the foreskin is far more responsive to
      sensation than previously thought."</p>

      <p>Kimmel found that the foreskin matches the lips and
      possibly exceeds the eyelids in sensitivity. "Circumcision
      represents a true loss of sensation, it is not a diminutive
      harm," Kimmel said. The foreskin went M-^Qoff the scale' in
      the standard 0-20 testing. A device that would measure even
      greater amounts of sensitivity was not available.</p>

      <p>Kimmel used a sample group of circumcised, intact, and
      restoring men. Initial findings indicate that restoring men
      gain back sensitivity, but never attain the sensitivity of
      men that were never circumcised.</p>

      <p>Confirming Kimmel's conclusions, presenters Dr. G. Boyle
      and G. Bensley reported that their findings revealed
      circumcised males are physically and psychologically harmed
      by the practice. The majority of circumcised men could be
      reliably classified as having penile scarring, being
      reluctance to use condoms, and experiencing a progressive
      decline in sexual sensitivity. Many express regret and are
      hesitant to think about their circumcision status. "There are
      many adverse physical, sexual and psychological effects from
      infant circumcision, which need to be acknowledged in any
      discussion pertaining to informed consent in relation to
      circumcision surgery."</p>

      <p>Fellow researcher Boyle reported, "A circumcised male has
      been deprived of a highly specialized, sensitive and
      erogenous part of his penis that would have served important
      sensory, sexual and protective functions had it been left in
      place."</p>

      <p>The <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/sixth/6thsymp.pdf"
      target="_blank">Sixth International Symposium on Genital
      Integrity</a> runs from December 7 to December 9, 2000.
      Experts from around the world will address the physical,
      psychological, religious, moral and ethical issues
      confronting Female and Male Genital Mutilation.</p>
