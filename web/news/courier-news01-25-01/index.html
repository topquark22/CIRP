      <h2>Circumcision case settled, parents quiet on details</h2>
      By CRISSA SHOEMAKER<br />
       Staff Writer

      <p><b>Published in the Courier News on January 25,
      2001</b></p>

      <p>The divorcing parents battling over whether their
      3-year-old son should be circumcised reached an agreement
      Wednesday to keep the case out of court and out of the public
      eye.</p>

      <p>As part of the out-of-court settlement, the application by
      Matthew Price's mother, Jennifer, of Clinton, seeking the
      surgery was withdrawn and the records concerning the
      circumcision and Matthew's health care were closed.</p>

      <p>But the parties remained tight-lipped about whether the
      surgery would be performed, saying only they were happy the
      case was over and they believed the agreement was in
      Matthew's best interests.</p>

      <p>"Both parties demonstrated a largeness of spirit in doing
      what was clearly in Matthew's best interest, notwithstanding
      any particular individual positions that they might have,"
      said Edward J. O'Donnell, the court-appointed attorney
      representing Matthew.</p>

      <p>Those individual positions were the subject of a
      monthslong court battle that went all the way to the state <a
      href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/index.htm"
      target="_blank">Supreme Court</a>.</p>

      <p>In August, state Superior Court Judge Paul Armstrong
      granted Mrs. Price's application that the surgery be
      performed, taking into account reports by two pediatricians
      that said the circumcision would alleviate problems Matthew
      had experienced at least twice.</p>

      <p>But Jim Price, of Raritan Borough, vehemently and publicly
      opposed the surgery, saying the inflammation Matthew
      experienced was caused by improper treatment, and
      circumcision would be unnecessary and harmful.</p>

      <p>Mr. Price appealed Armstrong's ruling, and the state
      Supreme Court sent the case back to the judge to hold a
      hearing on whether the surgery was medically necessary. That
      hearing was slated to start Tuesday and continue Wednesday,
      but was postponed due to the settlement talks, which began
      Friday.</p>

      <p>Mr. Price had said he would continue to appeal if the
      judge allowed the surgery to go forward after the hearing,
      but Tuesday said he couldn't comment on what the final
      outcome would be, only that he was "ecstatic."</p>

      <p>"I'm just happy that everything's over and that my son is
      a wonderful kid," he said. "We all won, because we don't have
      to carry this fight forward."</p>

      <p>A joint statement released by Matthew's parents said the
      two considered the recommendations of Matthew's treating
      physicians and the medical experts who examined him over the
      months leading to the hearing.</p>

      <p>"It is our mutual desire that this private family decision
      remain confidential so that our son's privacy rights are
      accorded due respect," the statement read. "We are certain
      that our decision will promote Matthew's best interests and
      welfare."</p>

      <p>Mr. Price's attorney, Julie Marino, and Mrs. Price's
      attorney, Ronald Heymann, ushered their clients out of the <a
      href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/somerset/index.htm"
      target="_blank">courthouse in Somerville</a> on Tuesday
      morning without commenting. Neither attorney returned calls
      seeking comment.</p>
