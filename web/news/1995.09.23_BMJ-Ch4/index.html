            <h2>A rite to drop</h2>

            <p>There are no medical reasons for excising a normal
            foreskin. Paediatricians and paediatric surgeons have
            been preaching this message for decades, and the
            population of boys being circumcised in the United
            Kingdom has now fallen to less than 10%. The practice
            of so called female circumcision has recently received
            considerable adverse publicity, but ritual male
            circumcision has been relatively unchallenged. The
            Jewish journalist Victor Schonfeld's programme for
            Channel 4's War Cries series went a long way to redress
            the balance.</p>

            <p>It seemed inconceivable to the supporters of the
            practice interviewed that any Jewish, Moslem, or
            African male should not have his foreskin removed. <a
            href="/news/independentmagazine08-20-94/">Dr Morris
            Sifman</a>, medical officer of the Initiation Society,
            was the staunchest advocate of this opinion and was
            convinced that circumcision did no harm. He also
            invoked blind faith: "A commandment from God is a good
            commandment." Ranged against these traditionalists was
            the eloquent Dr Jenny Goodman. Her speculation that the
            practice is a symbolic vestige of child sacrifice
            seemed far fetched, but her underlying thesis that
            religious ritual changes with time and that
            circumcision could easily be dropped seemed quite sound
            --especially by the end of the programme.</p>

            <p>Rabbi David Singer was filmed circumcising 8 day old
            Joshua Hawksworth, and it all went horribly wrong.
            Three days later Joshua was in intensive care being
            treated for severe septicsemia. It could be argued that
            Schonfeld struck lucky in filming this particular boy,
            but perhaps it was cause and effect. For the patient's
            sake any surgery is best conducted under ideal
            conditions. Introducing a film crew can make even the
            most experienced surgeon nervous and affect
            performance. Rabbi Singer certainly seemed nervous and
            clumsy, both performing the surgery and when adjusting
            the dressing at which point he requested the filming to
            be stopped. Schonfeld continued in secret. Where he did
            strike lucky is in the fact that Joshua's father is not
            Jewish and didn't attend the ceremony. The subsequent
            scenes of him watching the video and berating himself
            and his in laws for allowing it to happen are gripping
            stuff. What the experience has done for family dynamics
            doesn't bear contemplation. The myth that circumcision
            is just a "quick snip" and that newborns don't feel
            pain anyway were comprehensively demolished by the
            evidence in this generally well balanced documentary.
            Leela Kapila of Nottingham also provided graphic
            illustrations of the myriad complications which can
            follow this supposedly easy operation. The most moving
            moments, however, were the testimonies of previous
            sufferers: the Moslem man recalling a childhood trip to
            the hairdressers which resulted in him being suddenly
            forced on to a table and circumcised; and especially
            the African mother describing through slow tears the
            <span class="yellow">death</span> of her baby boy.</p>

            <p>One film will not change centuries of custom
            overnight, and who knows how many parents of the
            circumcising faiths will be persuaded not to subject
            their male offspring to a procedure which, viewed from
            outside the faith, could reasonably be described as
            ritualised child abuse.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the most we can hope for is that the debate
            will continue.</p>
