            <h2>Abraham's children chat</h2>

            <h3>Over bagels and samosas, the Canadian Association
            of Jews and Muslims seeks common ground<br />
             The group strives to improve relations</h3>

            <p>Amicable small talk. Queries about work, kids,
            vacations. More chit-chat. Laughter. And food. Plenty
            of food. Middle East delicacies like hummus and baba
            ghanouj are sampled with spicy samosas and mounds of
            bagels. Food works. It's the great connector.</p>

            <p>The bonhomie is undeniable and the lack of tension
            discernible among the 17 Muslims and Jews who gather
            this night at a Toronto Reform synagogue for one of
            their monthly meetings aimed at exploring each other's
            faith and finding common ground in their little corner
            of this overheated planet.</p>

            <p>It's not a forced cordiality. Voices are sincere,
            well-modulated. Even the occasional joke is thrown in.
            Coming to blows, even verbal ones, is unthinkable.</p>

            <p>Small steps for the children of Abraham, yet big
            ones at the same time.</p>

            <p>No one on this night at least brings up terrorism,
            or Israel and the Palestinian conflict, although that
            has a presence of its own (referred to internally as
            "the elephant in the room.") And no one mentions the
            Qur'- an's vexing approach to Jews &mdash; describing
            them in strongly disparaging terms one minute and
            extolling them as fellow believers the next &mdash; or
            that the holy text forbids Muslims from befriending
            Jews ( and Christians, too).</p>

            <p>While those and other sticking points aren't swept
            under the rug, they aren't dwelled on either. Rather,
            the Canadian Association of Jews and Muslims acts on
            the maxim "think globally, act locally." It focuses on
            improving relations between the two groups here in
            Toronto, home to about 350,000 Muslims and 175,000
            Jews, by first establishing mutual trust and a comfort
            level, and then learning about each other's religions,
            rituals and place in the world. The two sides also plan
            to join forces on domestic issues.</p>

            <p>For example, in August, the group wrote to Prime
            Minister Jean Chr&eacute;tien protesting the detention
            of 19 Pakistani Muslim Canadians on suspicion they
            might pose a threat to national security.</p>

            <p>"We're trying to build bridges of understanding so
            that even if you disagree vehemently, you'll still see
            the other person as a person," explains the group's
            Jewish co-chair, Barbara Landau, a psychologist and
            mediator who specializes in conflict resolution.</p>

            <p>"The idea is to listen as though the other person
            might be right."</p>

            <p>The dialogue was founded in 1996 by two colleagues
            in Ontario's civil service, Jack Stevens, an Iraqi Jew,
            and Shahid Akhtar, a Pakistani Muslim.</p>

            <p>"We noticed there was interaction between Christians
            and Jews, and there were multifaith groups, but nothing
            between Muslims and Jews," says Akhtar.</p>

            <p>It lay dormant for a while, but the Sept. 11, 2001,
            terrorist attacks rekindled the effort, this time as an
            attempt to defuse the anti-Muslim backlash. Just three
            days after the attacks, the group read a joint message
            at a Toronto City Hall rally affirming the ideals
            uniting them as Canadians, including valuing human
            life, mutual respect and co-existence.</p>

            <p>There's no official membership. About 100 regulars
            are on the roster, evenly divided between Jews and
            Muslims, the latter comprising both Sunnis and Shi'as
            mainly from Pakistan, India and East Africa. There are
            very few Arabs, and no Palestinians.</p>

            <p>"That's not deliberate," insists Landau, who helps
            run a separate Jewish-Palestinian dialogue.</p>

            <p>"We are here to learn about each other as well as
            from each other," pronounces Akhtar this night in the
            boardroom of <a href="http://www.temanuel.com/"
            target="_blank">Temple Emanu-El</a>, before introducing
            the guest speaker, Parveen Ali, a London, England-based
            lawyer and academic who talks about the role of women
            in Islam. She begins with the traditional Muslim
            greeting "Salaam Alekum," meaning peace be unto you
            &mdash; the same as the Hebrew "Shalom Alecheim."</p>

            <p>The floor is then turned over to Rabbi Edward Elkin,
            spiritual leader of Toronto's <a
            href="http://www.narayever.com/" target="_blank">First
            Narayever Congregation</a>, who expounds on the role of
            women in Judaism.</p>

            <p>Participants nod at the similarities and agree that
            in the broad spectrum of both religions, cases can be
            made for women's full equality as well as for their
            status as second-class citizens.</p>

            <p>"The more orthodox you get, the less legitimate
            everything else is," observes Landau.</p>

            <p>The group has hosted an interfaith Passover seder
            and a Rosh Hashanah dinner, and is planning a joint
            Ramadan-Chanukah celebration.</p>

            <p>The interaction isn't limited to exploring each
            others' religious traditions. There have been a number
            of joint initiatives:</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.cjc.ca/"
            target="_blank">Canadian Jewish Congress</a> supported
            Muslims on two occasions when municipal officials,
            citing zoning laws, tried to stop construction of
            mosques in East York and Mississauga. Both projects
            were eventually given the green light.</p>

            <p>Earlier this year, Canada's Pakistani community
            created a <a
            href="http://www.danielpearl.org/news_and_press/rays_of_hope/common_ground.html"
             target="_blank">journalism scholarship</a> in memory
            of Daniel Pearl, the Jewish reporter for the Wall
            Street Journal beheaded by Muslim extremists in
            Pakistan last year.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.isnacanada.com/"
            target="_blank">Islamic Society of North America
            (Canada)</a> joined the Jewish congress in supporting
            the provincial government's controversial tax credit
            for parents of children in faith-based schools.</p>

            <p>In February, Canadian Jewish Congress and the <a
            href="http://www.islamcan.com/websites/imamcouncil/index.shtml"
             target="_blank">Islamic Council of Imams-Canada</a>
            called on the federal government to exempt ritual
            slaughter of meats from proposed animal-cruelty
            legislation.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">And in 2001 Canadian Muslims
            and Jews came together to urge Ottawa to deny public
            funding to a group that sought to outlaw the
            circumcision of baby boys.</span></p>

            <p>A Jewish-Islamic study circle sponsored jointly by
            the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/"
            target="_blank">University of Toronto</a> and <a
            href="http://www.beth-tzedec.org/" target="_blank">Beth
            Tzedec Congregation</a> is in its second year.</p>

            <p>But what about the really heavy lifting: Israel, the
            status of Jerusalem, racial profiling, terrorism in the
            name of Islam, even whether to allow the Arab TV
            network Al-Jazeera into Canada?</p>

            <p>"Of course it comes up," says Akhtar. "It comes up
            all the time. We make it a point to talk about the
            difficult questions. But when we do, we do it in a most
            respectful manner, in a way we assume the other person
            could be right," he says, adding, with a chuckle, "We
            never come to blows."</p>

            <p>Landau says her expertise in conflict resolution
            comes in handy.</p>

            <p>"People who aren't listened to, escalate. When they
            are listened to, the rage dissipates. And when their
            stereotypical expectations aren't met, they move to
            curiosity.</p>

            <p>"There's an old Jewish saying: `God gave us two ears
            and one mouth.' We should listen twice as much as we
            should speak," she says.</p>

            <p>But relations are sometimes strained.</p>

            <p>The Jewish congress was dismayed when, in 2001, the
            Islamic congress gave a "media excellence award" to a
            local newspaper that supports Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>

            <p>"We would welcome greater public acknowledgment
            (from Canadian Muslims) that terrorism is a real and
            present danger," says the Jewish congress' Manuel
            Prutschi, citing the two communities' divergent views
            on federal anti-terrorism legislation and racial
            profiling.</p>

            <p>Another sore point is anti-Semitism. Jewish
            officials say that in Canada today, it emanates mainly
            from Muslim circles.</p>

            <p>"We will pursue good and better relations with the
            Muslim community," says Prutschi, "but we won't
            hesitate to expose and fight anti-Semitism."</p>

            <p>Farzana Hassan Shahid, a Muslim from Pakistan who's
            been in Canada 19 years, was moved to the join the
            dialogue because she saw something welcoming among
            Jews.</p>

            <p>"They appreciate the sanctity of life," says Shahid,
            who's president of the Ontario chapter of <a
            href="http://www.m-a-t.org/" target="_blank">Muslims
            Against Terrorism</a>, founded in Calgary in 1999.
            "They're very sincere in their efforts to promote peace
            and understanding. We need those in our community who
            are not convinced to see that."</p>

            <p>For local interfaith activist Fredelle Brief, the
            dialogue comes down to "the issue of democracy in a
            time of terror. If we take away the civil rights of
            some, we take them away for all. And that's not
            something that's on the public's agenda."</p>
