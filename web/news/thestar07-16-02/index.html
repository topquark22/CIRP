            <h2>Circumcision leaves 24 dead, 100 in hospital</h2>

            <p>JOHANNESBURG: South Africa's initiation season
            ended at the weekend with a gruesome toll of 24 deaths
            reported to police and more than 100 teenagers
            hospitalised with gangrene and septicaemia after
            botched circumcisions and severe beatings.</p>

            <p>One boy's penis dropped off as a result of
            gangrene, at least one other had to have his penis
            amputated, and another will have to have both legs
            amputated, authorities said.</p>

            <p>Teenagers have been attending initiation schools in
            the bush since the beginning of June for the rituals,
            seen in many black cultures as an essential rite of
            passage to manhood.</p>

            <p>Problems arise when circumcisers use blunt and
            unsterilised knives, and when punishments for such
            lapses as forgetting the words of a chant become too
            severe &ndash; some boys are literally beaten to
            death.</p>

            <p>In one bizarre case, police said a <a
            href="/news/citypress07-13-02/">77-year-old initiate
            was tortured to death</a> at Mafikeng, in the
            northwest.</p>

            <p>"He had injuries to the back and on the chest.
            He was tortured and beaten," said police
            spokesman Keaobaka Moses.</p>

            <p>Moses said the police were investigating the
            possibility that the man was taken to the school by
            force.</p>

            <p>The National House for Traditional Leaders said that
            if the government approved legislative powers for
            traditional leaders, they might be more able to control
            customs like initiation ceremonies.</p>

            <p>"If government doesn't want to give
            recognition to the institution, then you can't do
            anything really," said spokesman Sibusiso
            Nkosi.</p>

            <p>Nkosi said he had never heard of a 77-year-old
            person being an initiate.</p>

            <p>"We need to talk about how this tradition can
            be controlled. There is no uniformity anymore.
            It's out of control. People are more interested
            in making money than respecting the tradition."</p>

            <p>"It's not culture to beat a person."</p>

            <p>Other victims are as young as 12, although the law
            states that no one under 18 may undergo traditional
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>The traditional leaders are seeking funds to hold a
            round table conference with doctors, anthropologists
            and other experts on the initiation rites.</p>

            <p>The annual deaths are prompting calls for the boys
            to be circumcised in hospitals while continuing to
            undergo the remainder of the ceremonies in the
            initiation schools, and this is already happening to a
            limited extent.</p>

            <p>Several murder charges have been laid this season,
            prosecutions are being carried out under the
            Traditional Circumcision Act, and some schools were
            closed down.</p>

            <p>In the Eastern Cape, provincial health minister <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/structure/profile/goqwana.htm"
             target="_blank">Bevan Goqwana</a> accused parents of
            laxness and said the parents of boys killed or maimed
            during circumcisions would be arrested along with
            negligent traditional surgeons and nurses. &ndash;
