            <h2>Mass Circumcision in Kabul</h2>

            <p>Tue Jul 23, 8:29 AM ET</p>

            <p><font size="2"><i>By David Fox</i></font></p>

            <p>KABUL (Reuters) - Turkish troops leading the
            International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) for
            Afghanistan won friends among hundreds of Afghan
            families Tuesday after army doctors carried out a mass
            circumcision of boys who had missed the important
            Muslim ceremony for one reason or another.</p>

            <p>Army doctors from the prestigious<a
            href="http://eng.gata.edu.tr/" target="_blank">Gulhame
            Military Medical academy</a> in Turkey circumcised more
            than 90 boys Tuesday and plan to perform the operation
            on up to 200 others over the next two days.</p>

            <p>"Being circumcised is an important rite of passage
            for any Muslim male," said a Turkish officer overseeing
            the event who asked not to be identified.</p>

            <p>"It is accepted even by non-Muslims for health and
            hygiene reasons, but for us it is part of our faith,"
            he said.</p>

            <p>Most Afghan boys are circumcised between the age of
            two and five by religious elders who say a prayer
            before removing the foreskin with a knife -- without
            anaesthetic.</p>

            <p>If the boys are lucky, they will be plunged into an
            icy stream before the ritual in order to numb any
            pain.</p>

            <p>But the Turkish operation -- while yielding to
            tradition -- was a strictly medical procedure with a
            local anaesthetic being applied before the foreskin was
            removed with a sort of soldering- iron gun that cuts
            through the flesh and seals the wound behind it at the
            same time.</p>

            <p>Before the operation, the boys were given a huge
            party with special Turkish cakes and treats. A band
            played children's' songs as religious elders walked
            among the boys, muttering prayers and patting them on
            their heads.</p>

            <p>"These boys have missed being circumcised because
            perhaps there was trouble in their homes or their
            parents were too poor to afford it," the Turkish
            officer said.</p>

            <p>"Wherever we travel, we like to help the community
            by doing these sort of things -- even at the rural
            areas at home."</p>

            <p>The boys being circumcised Tuesday -- aged between
            two and 11 -- were a mixture of ashen-faced fear and
            confused apprehension as they awaited their turn with
            the team of eight surgeons and their assistants.</p>

            <p>Divided into groups of eight, it took just one
            nervous wail to get everyone else crying, but once the
            local anaesthetic took effect they calmed down and
            generally looked on at the goings-on between their legs
            with keen interest.</p>

            <p>Once the operation was complete, the boys were given
            a traditional white tunic, dressed in a large nappy and
            sent on their way -- clutching a bag of presents from a
            Turkish charity that raised money for the ceremony.</p>

            <p>Each bag contained a leather football, a pair of
            boots and a full soccer strip -- in the colors of the
            Turkish national team that surprised the world by
            finishing third in the World Cup won by Brazil last
            month.</p>

            <p>"It takes about five to eight minutes to do each
            person," an army doctor told Reuters. "If you want, I
            would be happy to do you and your colleagues."</p>
