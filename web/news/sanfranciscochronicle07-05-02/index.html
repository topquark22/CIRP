            say</h2>

            <p>Friday, July 5, 2002</p>

            <p><b>Barcelona, Spain --</b> Amid signs that the
            global epidemic is spiraling out of control, top AIDS
            experts rolled out a costly new prevention plan
            Thursday that they believe could avert 29 million new
            infections worldwide by the end of this decade.</p>

            <p>The new plan, announced in advance of Sunday's
            opening of the 14th International AIDS Conference here,
            calls for a quadrupling of current annual spending on
            prevention programs to $4.8 billion, from $1.2
            billion.</p>

            <p>If the world responded with that level of funding,
            it would surpass the $3 billion spent worldwide on all
            AIDS programs. The money would be spent to "scale up" a
            dozen existing prevention strategies said to have
            already shown their worth in places where they have
            been adequately funded. They include condom
            distribution efforts; media programs that sell the
            concept of safer sex; HIV-testing programs; blood
            screening; treatment of sexually transmitted diseases;
            short courses of AIDS drugs for pregnant women and
            their newborns; education programs in schools and the
            workplace; counseling for prostitutes; and programs to
            reduce needle sharing among injection drug users."</p>

            <p><span>"This is a package of proven interventions,"
            said <a href="http://www.who.int/home-page/"
            target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>
            epidemiologist Dr. Bernhard Schwartlander.</span>
            Schwartlander also warned that the higher spending
            called for by the plan, which was shepherded by the
            Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation of Seattle and the <a
            href="http://www.kff.org/" target="_blank">Kaiser
            Family Foundation</a> of Menlo Park, needs to be
            approved immediately.</p>

            <p>"If we delay implementation by one year," he told
            reporters in a telephone briefing, "we would cause
            another 5 million infections. If we delay by three
            years, it cuts the estimated gains in half. There is no
            time to lose." Earlier this week, a separate United
            Nations report warned that the epidemic will kill at
            least 68 million people by 2020 unless drastic measures
            are taken to prevent and treat HIV, the virus that
            causes AIDS.</p>

            <p>Schwartlander is the lead author of a complex
            mathematical analysis of the effect of increased
            prevention spending on targeted programs. The estimate
            that such an effort could prevent 29 million infections
            is drawn from that study, which is to be published in
            Saturday's edition of <i>The Lancet</i>, a British
            medical journal. "Our blueprint is a response to the
            Lancet article," said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of
            AIDS programs for the Gates Foundation. The panel of 40
            prevention experts that drew up the plan calls itself
            the Global HIV Prevention Working Group. It was drawn
            from around the globe, including United States and
            United Nations AIDS leaders, as well from African
            nations where the epidemic has hit hardest and where
            some of the most successful prevention efforts have
            been forged. "We failed to act decisively in the early
            stages of the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, and now
            we are paying the price," said David Serwadda, of <a
            href="http://www.makerere.ac.ug/"
            target="_blank">Makerere University</a> in Kampala,
            Uganda. ""But we still have an opportunity to save the
            next generation in Africa from AIDS, and to prevent
            runaway epidemics in India, Russia and China.''
            Uganda's high-profile program of condom distribution
            and open discussion of AIDS and its causes is credited
            with rolling back infection rates there to 5 percent in
            2001 compared with 30 percent in 1992.</p>

            <p><b>Vaccines not included</b></p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Not included in the proposal are AIDS vaccines there
            aren't any that are proven to work yet or the use of
            antiretroviral drugs to knock down the level of virus
            in patients' blood plasma, rendering them less
            infectious. The report concludes that idea "remains
            unproven" and that if the costly drugs are made more
            widely available, they would likely be given to those
            well along in their disease, diminishing the public
            health impact.</p>

            <p><span>Also left off the list as "unproven" is male
            circumcision. Although some 35 studies have shown that
            lack of circumcision is associated with a twofold to
            eight fold risk of getting HIV, definitive studies have
            yet to be completed. Experiments in Kenya and Uganda
            may yield an answer in two to five years.</span></p>

            <p><span>Schwartlander told reporters that there does
            appear to be a protective effect from circumcision of
            newborns, there is "absolutely no evidence" that it
            would work for adults, and "strong arguments that it
            might go in the opposite direction."</span></p>

            <p>Some activists fear that a push for prevention would
            come at the expense of efforts to bring cheap AIDS
            drugs to those infected.</p>

            <p>Schwartlander said the alleged conflict between
            prevention and treatment does not exist. "It's a false
            discussion. It ought to be avoided," he said.</p>
