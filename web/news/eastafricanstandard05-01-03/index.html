            <h2>Medic Explains Circumcision Deaths</h2>

            <p>By Standard Reporter<br />
             Nairobi</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Ninety per cent of youths who
            <a href="/library/death/">die after undergoing
            circumcision</a> suffer from undetected bleeding
            disorders, the chairman of Kenya Haemophilia
            Association, Dr Walter Mwanda, has
            announced.</span></p>

            <p>Mwanda said these children suffer from haemophilia
            and die due to lack of early detection of the condition
            which leads to their bleeding to death.</p>

            <p>He was speaking during a training for medical
            practitioners involved in haemophilic-related disorders
            lectured by the World Federation of
            Haemophilia(WFH),Kenya Haemophilic Association and <a
            href="http://www.kenyattanationalhospital.org/">Kenyatta
            National Hospital</a>. WFH Vice-President, Mr Paul
            Giangrande said Africa needed to know the implications
            of having a child with the disorder and what medics
            have to do for its treatment and survival.</p>

            <p>Mwanda said over the past four decades haemophilia,
            uncomplicated by inhibitor development, has become a
            condition that is treatable with clotting factor
            concentrates.</p>

            <p>He further noted the treatment with factor
            concentrates resulted into a normal life expectancy
            preventing crippling arthritis, muscle atrophy amongst
            other diseases. The diseases, he noted, have in the
            past resulted in many people becoming severely disabled
            by early adult life.</p>
