            <p>By Jeff Baird<br />

            <p>The Forum - 02/05/2003</p>

            <p>Attorneys Tuesday picked their jury in the
            circumcision lawsuit involving MeritCare Hospital, but
            that's about all they could agree on.</p>

            <p>East Central District <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/Rothe-Seeger.htm"
             target="_blank">Judge Cynthia Rothe-Seeger</a>
            dismissed the jury after listening to more than an hour
            of attorneys rehashing old arguments about what should
            be allowed during the trial.</p>

            <p>"How can we keep moving forward when I get stopped
            all the time?" said a frustrated Rothe-Seeger. "You
            can't even agree on what we should allow in opening
            statements."</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.zbaer.com/anita.htm"
            target="_blank">Anita Flatt</a> of <a
            href="http://www.hawley.govoffice.com/"
            target="_blank">Hawley</a>, Minn., is suing <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734"
             target="_blank">Dr. Sunita Kantak</a>, Fargo-based <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/">MeritCare Hospital</a>
            and the state of <a href="http://www.discovernd.com/"
            target="_blank">North Dakota</a> in Cass County
            District Court, claiming she and her husband, James,
            weren't told complete and accurate information about
            removing the foreskin from their son's penis.</p>

            <p>Anita Flatt, now an attorney at her attorney's law
            firm, signed a circumcision consent form, but hospital
            staff didn't describe the benefits or risks of the
            procedure, the lawsuit says.</p>

            <p>She wouldn't have consented to the procedure had she
            known what it entailed, Flatt said.</p>

            <p>She is asking for an unspecified amount in
            damages.</p>

            <p>The trial bogged down after lunch when Flatt
            attorney <a href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a> filed a motion for
            Rothe-Seeger to reconsider an earlier ruling preventing
            him from showing the jury videos of circumcision, tools
            used in the procedure and pictures of uncircumcised
            penises.</p>

            <p>With the jury waiting in a separate room, Baer told
            Rothe-Seeger he needed to introduce the videos, tools
            and photos to prove damages.</p>

            <p>"It's hard to prove damages without showing what is
            lost," he told the judge.</p>

            <p>Rothe-Seeger denied the request, saying there was no
            rule allowing the change.</p>

            <p>Baer and MeritCare attorney <a
            href="http://www.vogellaw.com/fsl5cs/XMLAttorneyProfile.asp?guid=I1D0AB9301DD211B28BAB4D00E205CACF&amp;ind_wld_id=1286278"
             target="_blank">Jane Voglewede</a> next argued about
            what should be allowed in opening statements.</p>

            <p>Baer wanted some latitude in describing
            circumcision. Voglewede said Baer should stick to the
            specific informed consent case involving Flatt's
            son.</p>

            <p>"(Baer) has made it clear he will go into explicit
            detail about circumcision," Voglewede told
            Rothe-Seeger.</p>

            <p>But the court, Voglewede argued, has already
            determined the procedure is not the issue in the case,
            and therefore it has no relevance to the jury.</p>

            <p>Rothe-Seeger told Baer the lawyer's freedom in
            opening statements would be limited to how circumcision
            it applied to the case.</p>

            <p>"This is not going to be a class or instruction on
            circumcision," she said.</p>

            <p>Before dismissing the jury, Rothe-Seeger asked for
            their continued patience.</p>

            <p>"We need to do some more work before we can proceed
            with the trial," Rothe- Seeger told the jury of six
            women and four men.</p>

            <p>Later she told them, "This doesn't work like a movie
            &hellip; where everything gets done in 60 minutes."</p>

            <p>The trial opened Monday but attorneys didn't pick a
            jury until noon Tuesday.</p>

            <p>"She is going to allow me to describe the process of
            circumcision as far as it relates to the duty of the
            doctor to disclose the procedure to obtain informed
            consent," Baer said of Rothe-Seeger after the trial
            recessed for the day.</p>

            <p>He expected the legal battles between himself and
            Voglewede to continue.</p>

            <p>"I foresee a litany of objections," he said. "That's
            one of the rules of the game. I play by the rules, but
            I have an obligation to my client to represent the
            claim she has presented."</p>

            <p>MeritCare officials left the courtroom without
            comment.</p>

            <p>The trial is expected to last two weeks.</p>
