            <h2>Circumcision law "is not working"</h2>

            <p>Many boys in Sweden are still being damaged by
            illegal circumcisions, despite the introduction of a
            law in 2001 to protect them. But how many boys are
            being operated on by people without the legal right to
            do so is still unclear, according to the <a
            href="http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/"
            target="_blank">National Board of Health and
            Welfare</a>.</p>

            <p>"We can't reach all of these," said Torsten
            Mossberg, who is head of the health board's regional
            supervisory unit in Stockholm.</p>

            <p>"But those of us who are in charge of supervision
            know that it happens and that now and then parents come
            in with a little boy with a bloody penis - and that's
            been done by someone," he said.</p>

            <p>Mossberg has studied at of the effects of the four
            year old law, which says that only a doctor or someone
            with special permission may perform circumcisions. If
            the child is older than two months, only a qualified
            doctor may carry out the operation.</p>

            <p>Circumcisions in Sweden are performed almost
            exclusively by Muslim and Jewish families and are
            grounded in religious beliefs.</p>

            <p>But the study's results are based on scarce
            evidence. Since the law came into effect, the National
            Board of Health and Welfare has had only three cases
            reported by the health service.</p>

            <p>In addition, five boys between the ages of one and
            seven have been registered within open care for
            complications after a circumcision. Precisely what
            those complications were was not addressed by Torsten's
            work.</p>

            <p>"It could be cases which were carried out in the
            public health system but my impression is that they
            were cases where the circumcision was not performed
            there," he said.</p>

            <p>Since these boys were all older than one year, the
            implication is that these were Muslim circumcisions
            since the Jewish ceremony is carried out in the first
            weeks after the birth. But Torsten Mossberg said he did
            not want to draw that conclusion.</p>

            <p>"I don't want to point out the Muslims," he said.
            "That would be too specific."</p>
