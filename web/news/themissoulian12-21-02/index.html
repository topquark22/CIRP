            <h2>Medicaid cuts announced</h2>

            <p><i>By JENNIFER McKEE of the Missoulian State
            Bureau</i></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans">State slashes
            more benefits as of Jan. 1</font></p>

            <p>HELENA - People with Medicaid, a federal-state
            insurance plan for the poor and elderly, will no longer
            be able to get prosthetic limbs, dental care,
            circumcisions and some other services, state officials
            announced Friday.</p>

            <p>Despite previous cuts to programs, the state
            estimated its Medicaid budget would be $3.6 million in
            the red by June 30, according to a <a
            href="http://www.dphhs.state.mt.us/services/programs_available/sfy_2003_budget.pdf"
             target="_blank">letter</a> Friday to doctors,
            hospitals and other medical personnel who treat
            Medicaid patients. To avoid busting its budget, the
            state's Medicaid Assistance Bureau decided to do away
            with some services temporarily, ax some for good,
            reduce payments and otherwise restrict services.</p>

            <p>The first of the cuts takes effect Jan. 1, when
            patients needing to rent a wheelchair, hospital bed or
            special shower and commode chair will have to submit
            those requests for review.</p>

            <p>Other cuts include:</p>

            <p>&bull; <span>A permanent end to Medicaid
            reimbursement for circumcision</span>, breast reduction
            surgery and gastric-bypass surgery, a radical surgery
            for the critically obese that reduces the size of the
            stomach.</p>

            <p>&bull; Physical, speech and occupational therapy
            will now have a 40-hours-per-year cap.</p>

            <p>&bull; Claritin, an allergy medicine now available
            without a prescription, will no longer be covered.</p>

            <p>Some of the cuts are only temporary, expiring in
            July, the beginning of a new fiscal year. Those
            include: no more dental care for anyone over 21, except
            to treat pain. No more prostheses, hearing aids,
            eyeglasses and other medical items for people over
            21.</p>

            <p>The state is reducing its payment to hospitals by 5
            percent temporarily.</p>

            <p>Ending dental care was expected to save $291,531.
            Ending coverage for prosthetic limbs and other
            equipment was expected to save $193,750. <span>Ending
            circumcisions was expected to save $25,378.</span></p>

            <p>The department also made other cuts in the amount of
            money it will pay to Medicaid providers such as doctors
            and hospitals and made it more difficult to qualify for
            Medicaid. Officials also transferred several hundred
            thousand dollars from other pots of money within the
            state <a href="" target="_blank">Department of Public
            Health and Human Services</a>' budget.</p>

            <p>The last cut to hit is a reduction in the amount of
            money Medicaid will pay for generic drugs, reducing how
            much the government covers from 85 percent of the
            average price to 75 percent. That goes into effect
            April 1.</p>

            <p>Because Medicaid is funded by federal matching
            dollars, the state's $3.6 million in cuts actually
            amounts to a $13.3 million hit to the program, the
            letter stated.</p>

            <p>Jeff Buska, Medicaid Bureau chief, said several
            doctors panels considered a variety of procedures, like
            circumcision and breast reduction, and concluded that
            they are not medically necessary.</p>

            <p>Consequently, Buska said, the agency decided to cut
            coverage for those services.</p>

            <p><span>Circumcision is something we've been looking
            at for a long time," he said.</span></p>
