            <h2>Bush surgeon was killed with a spade - police</h2>

            <p>By Nwabisa Nofemele<br />
            <br />
             In what is believed to be the first attack of its
            kind, a prominent traditional surgeon in Port Elizabeth
            has allegedly been hacked to death by a young man who
            claimed he had botched his circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             The brutal murder took place on Monday night at the
            former initiate's home in Sherwood, allegedly while his
            parents were out.<br />
            <br />
             A 22-year-old man has been arrested and will appear in
            court on Wednesday.</p>

            <table width="130" border="0" cellspacing="6"
            cellpadding="0" align="left" summary="insert">
              <tr>
                <td class="pullquote"><b>'My father went inside the
                house alone'</b></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Police spokesperson Ernest Sigobe said on Tuesday
            that the suspect had been arrested in connection with
            the murder of Patrick Hoho, 58, of Veeplaas, who was
            hacked to death with a spade.<br />
            <br />
             "The suspect was apparently angry about the way Hoho
            performed his circumcision in May," Sigobe said.<br />
            <br />
             The suspect is believed to have come out of the bush
            last month.<br />
            <br />
             Hoho's son, Lungisa, said the initiate had apparently
            been rejected by amakrwala (newly circumcised men), who
            said he was not "a real man".<br />
            <br />
             Amakrwala undergo rigorous tests by their peers to
            ascertain if they have been circumcised in a
            traditional way that prohibits the use of Western
            medication and influence.</p>

            <table width="130" border="0" cellspacing="6"
            cellpadding="0" align="left" summary="insert">
              <tr>
                <td><b>'I cannot believe that he has left
                us'</b></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>He said his father had received a phone call from
            the man around 8pm on Monday.<br />
            <br />
             "He asked my father to come and see him at his home in
            Sherwood at 10pm. My father went, accompanied my mother
            and a friend, Norman Mattick.<br />
            <br />
             "My father went inside the house alone."<br />
            <br />
             Half an hour later, the suspect's brother, who was
            also circumcised by Hoho in May, allegedly came out and
            told Mattick to "come in and fetch Hoho's body from the
            house".<br />
            <br />
             Circumcision activist Mamisa Chab ula-Nxiweni said she
            was shocked to learn about the murder.<br />
            <br />
             "I cannot believe that he has left us. He was a very
            experienced traditional surgeon.<br />
            <br />
             "This is definitely a loss of skill to our custom;
            there has never been anything like this before."<br />
            <br />
             Solomzi Mphandana, a spokesperson for Ingwe Yehlathi,
            a PE traditional surgeons' association, said no
            complaint had been laid against Hoho since he joined
            the association in 2001.</p>
