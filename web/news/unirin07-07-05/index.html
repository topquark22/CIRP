            Contributing to HIV Spread</h2>

            <p><b>UN Integrated Regional Information Networks
            NEWS</b> July 7, 2005<br />
            Posted to the web July 7, 2005<br />
            Johannesburg</p>

            <p>South African medical experts are concerned that the
            repeated use of unsterilised blades in the ritual
            circumcision of adolescent boys might be spreading
            HIV.</p>

            <p>The practice, which is performed without
            anaesthesia, is meant to reinforce the belief that
            "real men can endure pain", but hundreds of boys have
            died or been maimed by the procedure, leading
            provincial health officials to criticise the
            tradition.</p>

            <p>The Baltimore Sun newspaper in the US quoted Graeme
            Meintjes, a South African AIDS specialist and author of
            a book on ritual circumcision, as saying, "We can
            imagine, in some communities, about 20 percent of boys
            going off to the bush [for circumcision] will be HIV-
            positive - it's an extremely high risk."</p>

            <p>However, researchers have been hoping that
            circumcision might become an effective tool in slowing
            the spread of HIV in Africa, where an estimated 70
            percent of men are circumcised at birth or during rites
            of passage ceremonies.</p>
