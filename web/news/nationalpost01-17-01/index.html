      <h2>Human rights panel voices concern over circumcision</h2>
      <b>Most common surgery</b>

      <p><b>Adrian Humphreys</b></p>

      <p><b>National Post.</b> Canadian anti-circumcision groups
      are claiming victory after a change in <a
      href="http://www.ohrc.on.ca/english/publications/fgm-policy.htm">
      policy</a> by a human rights agency recognizes the
      possibility of harm from the procedure.</p>

      <p>A doctor had asked the <a
      href="http://www.ohrc.on.ca/">Ontario Human Rights
      Commission</a> to denounce male circumcision in the same way
      it condemns female genital mutilation.</p>

      <p>"I became aware that we had one standard for protecting
      the young women in our society and we had a different
      standard for protecting the young men in our society," said
      Dr. Arif Bhimji, a Toronto-area emergency room physician.</p>

      <p>The commission rejected that position, but amended its
      policy to include a statement flagging concerns over the
      routine surgery on baby boys. Previously, the commission's
      policy said male circumcision caused no damage to the penis
      and presented minimal danger.</p>

      <p>Dr. Bhimji said the change does not go far enough.</p>

      <p>"I think I would have liked to see it be more affirmative
      than it is, but I think it is a reasonable intermediate step
      to correct the misinformation," he said.</p>

      <p>Anti-circumcision activists heralded the change as a win
      in their campaign to ban the procedure, which remains the
      most common surgery in North America.</p>

      <p>The change was trumpeted by Lawrence Barichello, executive
      director of an organization called <a
      href="http://www.intact.ca/">Intact</a>, and by John
      Antonopoulos, president of the <a
      href="http://www.infocirc.org/">Circumcision Information
      Resource Centre</a>.</p>

      <p>"Their removal of these inaccuracies implies that male
      infant circumcision is damaging in itself, has complications,
      and does impact on male sexuality," said Mr.
      Antonopoulos.</p>

      <p>"They are saying that the difference between male
      circumcision and [female genital mutilation] is only a matter
      of degree."</p>

      <p>A spokeswoman for the commission, however, said the change
      is not as dramatic as the activists suggest.</p>

      <p>"We're a little surprised by the way the change has been
      characterized," said Pearl Eliadis, director of policy and
      education with the commission.</p>

      <p>"I don't want to dump on a group that, I'm sure, has
      legitimate concerns and really did bring it to our attention
      in good faith and we did change our research position on this
      as a result."</p>

      <p>"But it doesn't change the fact that [female genital
      mutilation] is a procedure used to subjugate women as a
      gender," Ms. Eliadis said. "It is used to suppress women's
      sexuality, it is grossly violative, and it creates gender
      specific problems in a way that male circumcision has never
      been used. It has never been used as a social tool to
      subjugate men."</p>

      <p>Intact came to public attention in October, 1999, when Mr.
      Barichello, of Toronto, announced he was organizing a
      class-action lawsuit on behalf of Canadian men who were
      circumcised as infants. The group is still working on the
      lawsuit.</p>

      <p>Circumcision was once routine in most North American
      hospitals, but a mounting body of medical evidence suggests
      the procedure is largely unnecessary.</p>

      <p>In 1996, the Canadian Paediatric Society published an <a
      href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm">extensive
      report</a> in the <i>Canadian Medical Association Journal</i>
      that concluded, as an official stance, that routine
      circumcision is not recommended.</p>
