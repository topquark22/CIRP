             10jan04</span></p>

            <p>A COUPLE has been charged with agreeing to
            circumcise two young girls in what is believed to be
            among the first cases filed under a US federal law
            banning female genital mutilation</p>

            <p>Todd Cameron Bertrang, 41, and Robin Faulkinbury,
            24, were arrested at their home in Canyon Country,
            California, after an FBI agent posing as a father of an
            eight-year-old and a 12-year-old contacted Bertrang via
            e-mail, then met him to discuss the procedure.</p>

            <p>Neither Bertrang nor Faulkinbury are accused of
            actually circumcising any minors.</p>

            <p>During an October 2002 meeting, Bertrang allegedly
            told the agents that "we have to go into this realising
            that to alter a female genitalia, in any fashion, under
            18, carries a five-year immediate prison sentence," an
            arrest affidavit stated.</p>

            <p>According to the criminal complaint, Bertrang is not
            licensed to practice medicine in California.</p>

            <p>On his Web site, Bertrang says he is an aficionado
            of body piercing and cutting who has performed body
            modifications on men and women.</p>

            <p>Bertrang boasted to an undercover FBI agent that he
            had performed more female circumcisions than "anyone
            else in the Western Hemisphere", according to the
            affidavit.</p>

            <p>Faulkinbury was identified to the agent as
            Bertrang's "slave" who assisted him in the
            procedures.</p>

            <p>Female circumcision, which may involve the removal
            of the clitoris or all the external genitalia, is a
            traditional procedure in some African cultures, but has
            been condemned by the United Nations.</p>

            <p>Assistant US Attorney Kevin Lally said there was no
            mention made of cultural reasons for the surgeries
            Bertrang and Faulkinbury allegedly agreed to.</p>

            <p>Bertrang and Faulkinbury were charged with
            conspiracy to violate the federal Prohibition of Female
            Mutilation Act of 1995, which outlaws the removal of
            certain sexual organs on girls under age 18 unless it
            is medically necessary and only then if performed by a
            licensed medical practitioner.</p>

            <p>Lally said there never has been a decision or appeal
            in such a case, and he had not heard of any cases even
            being filed under the law.</p>

            <p>Bertrang and Faulkinbury are being held without
            bail.</p>

            <p>Each defendant could each face up to five years in
            prison if convicted.</p>
