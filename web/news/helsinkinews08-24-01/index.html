        <h2><font face="arial">Danger of botched home circumcisions
        a problem for low-income Muslim families</font></h2>

        <p><font face="arial"><b>Wealthy families can afford
        services of private hospitals</b></font></p>

        <p><font face="arial">Last week's case in which a number of
        Muslim boys in Kuopio had to be hospitalised after
        complications involved with circumcisions performed at home
        (see link below) has led to new debate on the issue of
        religious circumcision.</font></p>

        <p><font face="arial">According to Imam Chodr Chehab of
        Finland's Islamic community, most of the Muslims living in
        Finland are immigrants.</font></p>

        <p><font face="arial">"Circumcisions should not be
        performed at home, but it is the only alternative for those
        families who cannot afford private hospital treatment",
        Chehab says.</font></p>

        <p><font face="arial">Private hospitals charge FIM 4,000 -
        5,000 for a circumcision.</font></p>

        <p><font face="arial">Chehab is concerned about the
        possible complications that can ensue from performing the
        procedure at home. He says that places should be made
        available where competent surgeons could perform
        circumcisions.</font></p>

        <p><font face="arial">In addition to recent immigrants,
        Finland has a community of Tartars, who have lived in this
        country for more than 100 years. They routinely have their
        sons circumcised at private hospitals.</font></p>

        <p><font face="arial">In Finland's Jewish community, male
        babies are circumcised at the age of eight days either by a
        Jewish doctor, or a mohel specially trained to perform the
        procedure. The ritual circumcision is performed either at
        home or the synagogue.</font></p>

        <p><font face="arial">"If the circumcision is delayed, it
        is performed on children and adults at a hospital or
        similar facility", says Dan Kantor, a representative of
        Helsinki's Jewish congregation.</font></p>

        <p><font face="arial">In a statement issued in 1992 the <a
        href="http://www.vn.fi/stm/english/index.htm">Ministry of
        Social Affairs and Health</a> urges Finnish public health
        clinics and hospitals to take a positive view toward
        religiously motivated male circumcision.</font></p>

        <p><font face="arial">In a ruling in 1999, <a
        href="http://www.eduskunta.fi/efakta/eoa/eoa1e.htm#ombudsman">
        Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman</a> Riitta-Leena Paunio said
        that Finnish law does not oblige public health care
        services to arrange circumcisions for non-medical
        reasons.</font></p>

        <p><font face="arial">In a statement issued in 1999, a
        majority of the members of Finland's advisory committee on
        medical ethics (<a
        href="http://www.etene.org/index.shtml">ETENE</a>) felt
        that public health services could be used for the
        circumcisions of Jewish and Muslim boys.</font></p>

        <p><font face="arial">In the United States circumcisions
        are common for boys of all religions, because the removal
        of the foreskin is believed to have health benefits,
        including the prevention of urinary infections. "In Europe
        the thinking is that the foreskin is a part of the organ.
        If it is healthy, it should not be removed", says urologist
        Tuija Lahdes-Vasama.</font></p>
