      <h2>Trial Could Set Legal Precedent</h2>
      <b>By CRISSA SHOEMAKER</b><br />
      Staff Writer 

      <p>The case began as two divorcing parents battling over the
      circumcision of their 3-year-old son.</p>

      <p>On Monday, the couple will appear in state Superior Court
      in Somerville for a hearing ordered by the state Supreme
      Court to determine whether the surgery should go forward.</p>

      <p>The case, believed to be the first of its kind in the
      United States, has drawn the attention of the nation's oldest
      medical society, an attorney from the landmark Baby M case
      and scores of observers from around the nation who have
      flooded the court with phone calls, letters and e-mails
      decrying the surgery.</p>

      <p>At stake is either the civil rights or the health of a
      child, depending on which side is asked.</p>

      <p>The boy's father, Jim Price of Raritan Borough, insists
      he's right when he calls the surgery -- unquestioned as a
      routine procedure by many people -- "sexual mutilation."</p>

      <p>However, Matthew's mother, Jennifer Price of Clinton,
      maintains that the surgery is needed to correct recurring
      inflammations experienced by the child.</p>

      <p>A third attorney, Edward J. O'Donnell, an attorney for the
      biological father in the Baby M surrogacy case, will argue
      for the boy's best interest as Matthew's court-appointed
      attorney. And while O'Donnell declined to comment on what his
      recommendations would be regarding the surgery, he has asked
      the court to close the proceeding to the public.</p>

      <p>"Matthew has privacy interests that would override really
      any interest the public has to know about these details,"
      O'Donnell said. "Matthew doesn't need to have the fact of
      whether he is circumcised or uncircumcised be a matter of
      public record for the rest of his life."</p>

      <p>Superior Court Judge Paul Armstrong will hear arguments on
      closing the proceeding Monday, and attorneys for the Courier
      News and the Star Ledger will be present to oppose the
      motion. Mrs. Price's attorney, Ronald Heymann, has joined in
      O'Donnell's motion to close the courtroom.</p>

      <p>O'Donnell will present testimony from Robert Pickens, a
      Princeton urologist named as the court's expert.</p>

      <p>"There's only one issue: Matthew, and what is best for
      him, and whether either party or both parties have larger
      issues dealing with their philosophies has nothing to do with
      this case," O'Donnell said.</p>

      <p>The case has practically taken on a life of its own since
      August, when Armstrong ruled that the circumcision could go
      forward despite Mr. Price's objections.</p>

      <p>He based his ruling on two medical reports submitted by
      Matthew's pediatricians recommending that the surgery could
      alleviate an inflammation the child had twice
      experienced.</p>

      <p>"Both of these physicians believe that a circumcision will
      alleviate Matthew's problem, and while (the) defendant's
      medical physician seems to suggest that circumcision may not
      be currently warranted, he does not refute the fact that the
      surgery is minor and will give Matthew the best chance to
      alleviate his problem," Armstrong wrote in his order.</p>

      <p>The surgery was scheduled for Oct. 12, but the pediatric
      urologist scheduled to perform it, Dr. Joseph Barone, backed
      out under legal threats from the father. The parents were in
      court the next day with motions to award full custody to Mrs.
      Price and, on the other side, to hold a hearing on the
      surgery, both of which were denied.</p>

      <p>Barone and Dr. Grace Calimlim, whose medical reports were
      those used by Armstrong in his decision, are expected to
      testify on Mrs. Price's behalf. Dr. Robert Van Howe, a
      Wisconsin doctor who has published numerous articles on
      circumcision, will be presented as an expert for Mr.
      Price.</p>

      <p>Mr. Price has argued his case both in court and in the
      media, appearing on Howard Stern's radio show and an
      as-yet-unaired episode of Montel Williams' talk show.</p>

      <p>He won a stay in the state Superior Court Appellate
      Division, but that court later ruled that the surgery could
      go forward. He appealed to the Supreme Court, which on Oct.
      31 sent the case back to Armstrong for the hearing.</p>

      <p>Mrs. Price's view has been bolstered by a
      friend-of-the-court brief filed by the Medical Society of New
      Jersey -- the oldest medical society in the nation -- and the
      Urology Society of New Jersey, who argued that the court
      should follow the advice of Matthew Price's treating
      pediatricians.</p>

      <p>"Is a court to involve itself in deciding whether a
      splinter should be removed with a needle or a tweezer?" the
      societies' brief states. "Should a court decide whether a
      patient receives penicillin or ampicillin? Obviously not.
      However, by inserting itself into this case to equally weight
      the competing views of two physicians, the Court, ipso facto
      becomes a `super doctor.'"</p>

      <p>But the <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/"
      target="_blank">National Organization of Circumcision
      Resource Centers</a>, which has submitted a
      friend-of-the-court brief that had not been accepted by the
      court as of Friday afternoon, says that the surgery can be
      both physically and psychologically dangerous.</p>

      <p>"He (Matthew) would suffer irreparable physical, sexual
      and emotional injury if subjected to a penile surgery," the
      brief states. "Matthew has a right to bodily and genital
      integrity. No clear and convincing evidence has been produced
      or is likely to be produced to support an order for
      circumcision."</p>

      <p>The group, based in California, has set up a defense fund
      on Mr. Price's behalf.</p>

      <p>Armstrong is not expected to make an immediate ruling.</p>

      <p>"The issue here now is larger than a circumcision,"
      Heymann said. "The issue is that when you have separated or
      divorced parents, and one parent has the primary physical
      custody of that child, what type of medical decision is that
      parent entitled to make for the benefit and the best interest
      of the child without the consent of the other party, or at
      the very least without having to litigate in order to do
      it?"</p>

      <p>For Mr. Price, however, what's at stake goes beyond who
      can make the decision.</p>

      <p>"What's at stake here is his (Matthew's) right to be a
      whole person, his constitutional right to be whole and to
      bodily integrity," he said. "His right to choose is at stake
      here."</p>

      <p>Mr. Price said he would appeal if Armstrong allows the
      surgery to go forward.</p>

      <p>"They did it to me, and they're not getting him," he said.
      "I'm not letting them do it to him."</p>
