      <h1>Internet threat to Israel, say rabbis</h1>

      <h2>Torah Sages ban Internet use [7 Jan '00] - Ha'aretz</h2>
    </center>

    <p>ISRAEL'S leading orthodox rabbis have issued a ruling
    banning the internet from Jewish homes, arguing that it is
    "1,000 times more dangerous than television" and threatens the
    survival of the country.</p>

    <p>The ruling, issued by the Council of Torah Sages, is an
    attempt by the rabbis to halt the infiltration of "sin and
    abomination" from the internet into the homes of the
    ultra-orthodox, whose children have hitherto been shielded from
    the temptations of the modern world.</p>

    <p>The rabbis recalled that they had banned television 30 years
    ago, and said that the dangers from the internet were even
    greater. They said it "puts the future generations of Israel in
    grave danger in a way that no other threat has since Israel
    became a nation."</p>

    <p>The newspaper of Degel Hatorah, one of the strictest of the
    religious parties in Israel, said the internet was "the world's
    leading cause of temptation, it incites and encourages sin and
    abomination of the worst kind."</p>

    <p>The majority of Israelis, who are secular, will ignore the
    ruling. But it is likely to deprive young members of the
    ultra-orthodox community - those who wear the black hats and
    long coats of the European ghetto - of a window on the secular
    world. Religious leaders are worried about a growing number of
    youths who break out of their closed communities in search of a
    secular life - a development that is partly blamed on the
    arrival of the computer in their homes, giving them the chance
    to join discussion groups, hear forbidden music and read about
    life outside.</p>

    <p>The ruling follows a sharp debate in the ultra-orthodox
    community about the role of computers. Some have seen them as a
    blessing, enabling men and women to earn money as computer
    programmers - a skill that many in these strict communities
    believe they excel in thanks to years of studying the
    intricacies of Jewish religious texts.</p>

    <p>But other rabbis have argued that the computer is a Trojan
    Horse of secular filth.</p>

    <p>The Torah Sages recommended that those who make a living in
    computers should be allowed to use them only at the work place.
    Those who do not have rabbinical permission to use a computer
    are called on to delete the web browser, which makes it
    impossible to surf the net.</p>

    <p>The newspaper Haaretz pointed out that while the most
    extreme sects banned all uses of the internet, even for
    business, as a "deadly poison which burns souls," there are
    many web sites designed as aids to studying the Torah. Rabbi
    Ovadia Yosef, a former chief rabbi of Israel, has his own
    website.</p>

    <p>Earlier this week, a 17-year-old student from Hertfordshire
    announced plans to float his Jewish community web site on the
    London Stock Exchange. Benjamin Cohen could become a
    millionaire with the popular site which includes business news,
    a dating agency and a `cyber rabbi.'</p>
