            Cape Town, South Africa 

            <p>About 20 circumcision initiates in Port Elizabeth
            turned on their traditional nurse and killed him, an
            Eastern Cape <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/department_ministry.asp?departmentID=4&amp;menuid=191&amp;mainmenuid=53"
             target="_blank">health department</a> official said on
            Monday.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/department_assistants.asp?departmentID=4&amp;contactID=16&amp;noContact=1"
             target="_blank">Sizwe Kupelo</a> said the incident
            occurred on Friday, when the unnamed nurse was
            assaulted with sticks and died from his injuries.</p>

            <p>"It is alleged he was not doing his job properly and
            was neglecting the initiates," said Kupelo.</p>

            <p>He said no arrests had been effected by Monday
            afternoon among the initiates, aged between 18 and
            25.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the chairperson of the <a
            href="/news/eastcapenews10-26-01/"
            target="_blank">Eastern Cape House of Traditional
            Leaders</a>, Chief Ngangomhlaba Matanzima, said that
            Friday's incident was "unheard of".</p>

            <p>Matanzima said the incident showed there are
            "serious problems" around initiations, adding that he
            condemns the murder.</p>

            <p>"For the boys to take such action ... one would
            expect that kind of action by the parents and not by
            the children."</p>

            <p>According to Kupelo, since the start of the December
            initiation period, 10 initiates have succumbed to their
            injuries.</p>

            <p>This includes the death of an initiate allegedly at
            the hands of traditional nurses in the Bizana area in
            eastern Pondoland. His body was dumped in a forest in
            an attempt to hide the death. -- Sapa</p>
