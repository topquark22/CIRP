            <h2>Brothers in double tragedy after initiation</h2>

            <p>By Mvuyo Mati</p>

            <p>EAST LONDON - Health MEC <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/department_ministry.asp?contactID=16&amp;departmentID=4"
             target="_blank">Bevan Goqwana</a> has expressed shock
            at the deaths of an initiate and his elder brother, who
            apparently killed themselves in separate incidents at
            the weekend.</p>

            <p>Goqwana said the initiate, Dontsa Lwane, 19, was
            found hanging at one of his homestead dwellings in
            Gqebenya locality near Lady Frere on Saturday.</p>

            <p>His brother, Wandile, 21, was found shot in a family
            house at Ezibeleni near Queenstown at about 2 am
            yesterday.</p>

            <p>Goqwana said Dontsa was referred to Frontier
            Hospital in Queenstown on Friday with his parents'
            consent after he experienced medical complications
            following his circumcision on December 11. He was
            treated and discharged.</p>

            <p>On his return to his hut, he removed the hospital
            dressing, but the older men allegedly forced him to put
            it back.</p>

            <p>He disappeared at about 7 pm and was found hanging
            in his home by his brother, who later shot himself at
            Ezibeleni.</p>

            <p>A health officer, who spoke on condition of
            anonymity, said Lwane had indicated on his way back
            from the hospital that he would not be accepted back in
            the community.</p>

            <p>Commenting on the deaths, Goqwana said they showed
            just how much stigma was involved in the circumcision
            ritual and this had had an impact on the youngster
            because he thought he would not be regarded as a
            man.</p>

            <p>Goqwana stressed the need for counselling of
            youngsters before they undergo the initiation
            ritual.</p>

            <p>Health Department officials closed down an
            initiation school at Mpindweni near Libode yesterday
            and five initiates were referred to Mthatha General
            Hospital. One was suffering from urinary complications
            and was in a critical condition, according to Health
            Department spokesman Sizwe Kupelo.</p>

            <p>The other four initiates were treated and sent home
            to recover.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said the traditional surgeon had been
            arrested for not complying with the Traditional
            Circumcision Act. If found guilty he could face up 10
            years' imprisonment or a fine of R15 000.</p>

            <p>A squabble believed to have been over a stolen
            mandrax tablet in a circumcision hut at Mavuso, near
            Alice, led to a man being stabbed to death in the early
            hours of Saturday morning, police reported. A man has
            been arrested.</p>
