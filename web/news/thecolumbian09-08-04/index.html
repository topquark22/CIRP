            <h2>Man charged in apparent circumcision of son, 8</h2>

            <p>Wednesday, September 8, 2004<br />
             <b>By STEPHANIE RICE, Columbian staff writer</b></p>

            <p>The Bible apparently inspired a <a
            href="http://www.ridgefieldwash.com/"
            target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> man to try to circumcise
            his 8-year-old son, but then he called 911 because he
            was concerned about the amount of blood the youngster
            was losing.</p>

            <p>Edwin Bruce Baxter, 33, made his first appearance
            Tuesday in <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/courts/superior/index.html"
             target="_blank">Clark County Superior Court</a>.</p>

            <p>He has been charged with first-degree <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/boyle1/"
            target="_blank">assault</a> of a child. If convicted,
            he faces at least 10 years in prison.</p>

            <p>Baxter was arrested Friday and taken to the <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/sheriff/custody/Index.html"
             target="_blank">Clark County Jail</a>. His son was
            taken to <a href="http://www.swmedicalcenter.com/"
            target="_blank">Southwest Washington Medical
            Center</a>, where he received several stitches.</p>

            <p>On Tuesday, Superior Court Judge <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/courts/superior/judges.html"
             target="_blank">Diane Woolard</a> set bail at
            $50,000.</p>

            <p>She appointed attorney Tony Lowe to represent Baxter
            and set arraignment for Sept. 17.</p>

            <p>Baxter lives with his wife and nine children in a
            two-bedroom, one-bathroom home. He supports his family
            with the $3,000 a month he earns as a truck driver with
            Helser Brothers Transfer Co. in Portland, according to
            documents filed in court.</p>

            <p>Clark County senior deputy prosecutor <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/pa/criminal/childabuse.html"
             target="_blank">Kim Farr</a> said Baxter has a 1993
            conviction for domestic violence, and was arrested for
            the same charge in 1994 but the case was dismissed.</p>

            <p>An investigator for the <a
            href="https://fortress.wa.gov/dshs/caoffices/internetapps/ca/display.asp?officeName=Vancouver%20DCFS"
             target="_blank">Department of Children and Family
            Services</a> was sent to the family's rental home
            Tuesday, said Doug Lehrman, Vancouver administrator for
            the state agency.</p>

            <p>The fence surrounding the family's yard was
            padlocked and the investigator could not get in,
            Lehrman said.</p>

            <p>"There was no sign of human inhabitation at the
            home," he said.</p>

            <p>The investigator left his business card and will try
            to contact the family later.</p>

            <p>This wasn't the first time someone from the state
            had tried to contact the Baxters. The parents have been
            reported for allegedly failing to enroll their children
            in school or in an approved home-school program.</p>

            <p>"We've had some past referrals for educational
            neglect ... but we've never been able to lay eyes on
            these parents," Lehrman said.</p>

            <p>He did not have the ages of the other children
            reportedly living in the home.</p>

            <p>According to a probable-cause affidavit written by a
            Clark County sheriff's deputy, Baxter said he tried to
            circumcise his son with a knife in the bathroom after
            reading Genesis 17 and Exodus 4. Both biblical chapters
            refer to circumcision.</p>

            <p>He told deputies he had no medical training.</p>

            <p>When he was booked into the Clark County Jail, he
            allegedly told a corrections officer he had no history
            of mental-health issues. Drugs and alcohol were not
            reported to be factors.</p>
