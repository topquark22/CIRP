      <h2>Bisho Legislatue Passes Bill On Regulation
      Circumcision</h2>

      <p>Bisho opposition parties yesterday (subs: thurs) came out
      in support of the ANC and passed a much-needed bill which
      regulates traditional circumcision.</p>

      <p>The Act introduced by acting Health MEC Max Mamase lays
      down rules for the the maintenance of hygenic conditions when
      the custom is perfomed.</p>

      <p>It calls for irresponsible Iingcibi and amakhankatha
      (traditional surgeons and nurses) to be fined R10 000 or
      imprisoned up to ten years for contravening the Act.</p>

      <p>Mamase said the Act would ensure that initiates were only
      circumcised after with parents or gurdians had given'
      permission and initiates had to be 18 or older.</p>

      <p>Health standing committee chairperson Mahlubandile Qwase
      of the ANC said only in "rare circumstances" could boys older
      than 16 years be circumsised.</p>

      <p>UDM MPL Pofolo Kakudi said the national assembly was
      supposed to have played a role in the compilation of the Act
      in order to ensure national uniformity.</p>

      <p>Because of cultural diversity, some people could be
      convicted of breaching the law because they were using their
      own "style".</p>

      <p>The Act needed to be "equally and similarly applicable to
      all concerned".</p>

      <p>He called for more emphasis on training Iingcibi and
      amakhankatha and for the process to be community-driven.</p>

      <p>Traditional authorities had to play a major role in
      accrediting potential initiates and traditional surgeons.</p>

      <p>DA Leader Athol Trollip said the issue of "fly-by-night"
      traditional surgeons" who cashed-in on circumcisions should
      be dealt with.</p>
      He said the Act was"long overdue" with the number of botched
      circumcisions icreasing all the time. 

      <p>The laws also seeks to ensure that boys are examined
      medically while instruments must be sterilized.</p>

      <p>ANC MPL Themba Manyosi circumcision schools should be
      "humanly habitable and worth living in in terms of health
      standards"</p>
