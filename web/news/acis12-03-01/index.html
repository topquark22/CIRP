      <p>Mwingirwa Kithure<br />
      Nairobi</p>

      <p>That fateful Saturday, July 17 this year, is the day Joyce
      Kananu, 18, vows never to forget until the end of her life.
      It is the day the unexpected struck. The painful experience
      Kananu endured while the dirty hands of that sweating woman
      clinching a piece of rusted razor blade mercilessly mutilated
      her symbol of womanhood is etched in her mind.</p>

      <p>I had gone to visit my auntie, Susan Njau, who stays in
      Murera village, Baibariu sub-location of Ndoleli division in
      Nyambebe hills. Since I don't go to school, having dropped
      out in class three because of fee problems after my mother
      separated with my father, I had plenty of time at our home in
      Uthiiru Gaiti, many kilometres from Maua town, Meru-North
      district.</p>

      <p>"After I had settled at my aunt's place, she sent me to
      the market. Since I was a regular visitor to the region, I
      knew some women. I met some on my way to the market.</p>

      <p>"I greeted them, but they insisted I come in their
      compound and greet them by hand. Since I did not suspect
      anything fishy, I proceded to greet them by hand, though
      protesting that I was in a hurry."</p>

      <p>One woman called Karauki asked her to enter her house,
      which was open, and have some food. She initially hesitated,
      citing elapsing time, but finally they succeeded in
      prevailing upon her to enter and have some food.</p>

      <p>She entered Karauki's hut and she heaped food on her
      palms. Suddenly, Karauki and four other women flung the door
      closed.</p>

      <p>Singing circumcision songs and ululating, they held her
      and informed her that she has done a grave sin by entering a
      house hosting a Ngutu - a circumcised woman - while she was a
      Mukenye- uncircumcised girl.</p>

      <p>Realising the messy situation she was in, she pleaded with
      them that they let her out since it is them who tricked
      her.</p>

      <p>They could not hear any of this. Beating had now started
      and stripping was progressing slowly while they poked fun at
      her anatomical features.</p>

      <p>While this continued, some women had gone to her aunt's
      place to inform her of Kananu's capture and the only way out.
      This ostensibly was circumcision.</p>

      <p>"My aunt, like I, had resolved that I will never get
      circumcised since circumcision had more harm than benefits to
      a girl's body," she said.</p>

      <p>Her aunt stubbornly refused to grant them the go-ahead to
      cut her as she learnt from the women who tripped back to the
      room where she was held hostage. Nevertheless, they resolved
      that she had to be circumcised.</p>

      <p>"By now, I was soaked in tears, consumed by fright and
      resignedly coiled on the dirty floor awaiting my fate.
      Inebriated by a local brew called Kaanga, the four women
      sought the assistance of 12 men, who forcibly held me, some
      separating my twitched legs.</p>

      <p>"When I tried to bring my knees together, one man hit me.
      This is the recovering wound they inflicted on me," Kananu
      pointed to us while sobbing.</p>

      <p>She said the pain was searing. The circumciser, drunk and
      with trembling hands, cut her clitoris slowly and with a
      thrice punctuation of hesitation to enjoy the excruciating
      pain registered on her concocted face.</p>

      <p>"I was sited on a pool of blood. The razor blade, removed
      from a basket hung on a wall, had probably been used to
      circumcise my predecessor, who was enjoying every bit of my
      painful experience.</p>

      <p>"Most disheartening, the women and the helping men would
      pause to sip mouthfuls of Kaanga while I was in pain and
      soaked in blood," she recalls.</p>

      <p>When they finished the gruelling mutilation, they told her
      to rest. By now, the women were excitedly singing. All night
      long, she had eaten nothing, except a cup of black tea that
      they cooked for her. Yes, it was sugarless. They did not care
      to bathe her, neither bothered to give her anything to cover
      herself with from the biting July cold.</p>

      <p>The knowledge that she could not avoid infections in such
      dumpy conditions nagged her tortured mind, but she thought
      she was a captive without rights. Escape was unimaginable
      because of the acute pain she was experiencing. She could
      hardly stand.</p>

      <p>The following day, her infuriated aunt went to inform the
      police at Kiutine Police Post that she had been captured and
      forcibly circumcised. Her captors got wind that the police
      had been informed of her circumcision.</p>

      <p>Because of this, Karauki asked her to tell the police that
      she circumcised her out of her own wish. When she declined,
      the woman ran away when she heard that the police were about
      to strike.</p>

      <p>"When police arrived, they arrested the woman taking care
      of us. Karauki had escaped. My mother, accompanied by Abraham
      Kamuyu M'ikirima of Nyambene Child Ministry (NCM), took me to
      the hospital, where I was given drugs that I am now
      using."</p>

      <p>Kamuyu hired a vehicle that took her home, and is
      facilitating the arrest of her circumciser.</p>

      <p>Now that she has been circumcised without her consent and
      the act cannot be reversed, she is bitter. The realisation
      that she will not be able to enjoy the sexual pleasures that
      uncircumcised women relish, and that she is among the
      circumcised women who are likely to experience delivery
      problems saddens her a lot.</p>

      <p>Kananu's experience is one among many such circumcision
      cases that are carried out in <a
      href="http://www.kenyaweb.com/regions/eastern/meru/meru.html">
      Meru District</a>. NCM Executive Director Mr Kamuyu reveals
      that 36 cases of girls' circumcision have been reported this
      year, and there are numerous others taking place
      underground.</p>

      <p>Kamuyu adds that parents in the district force their
      daughters to circumcise in order to pay for them school fees
      or get husbands. They discourage their sons from marrying
      uncircumcised girls, citing numerous outdated traditions.</p>

      <p>It took the intervention of the government and Kamuyu's
      NCM to have the father of a girl in the district called
      Regina Kaunanku pay for her school fees.</p>

      <p>The father had chased the girl away from home in 1998 for
      refusing to get circumcised, while her sister obliged so that
      her father could pay her school fees.</p>
