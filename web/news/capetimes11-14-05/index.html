            <h2>Traditional surgeons nabbed for circumcisions</h2>

            <p>By Michel Muller</p>

            <p>The police have arrested three illegal traditional
            surgeons in the Eastern Cape since late last week,
            department of health spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said on
            Saturday.</p>

            <p>"Illegal traditional surgeons caught circumcising
            underage boys will feel the full might of the law," he
            said.</p>

            <p>"We are taking a no-nonsense approach to them."</p>

            <p>'We have three helicopters and 400 4x4s on standby'.
            He said the department and the police were clamping
            down on illegal circumcisions after <span
            class="yellow">23 boys died in the June-July
            circumcisions in the Eastern Cape.</span></p>

            <p>The department had met the provincial police
            commissioner "to discuss strategies".</p>

            <p>"We are also approaching the minister of justice and
            the director of public prosecutions to make sure that
            if an illegal surgeon is arrested, he stays in jail
            until the end of the season."</p>

            <p>The penalties, in terms of the Traditional
            Circumcision Act No 6 of 2001, were one to 15 years in
            jail or a R1 000 to R15 000 fine.</p>

            <p>"Since the act came in, we have successfully
            convicted and sentenced 31 illegal traditional surgeons
            and nurses, out of 63 charged," he said.</p>

            <p>'Illegal surgeons have no place to hide' Health MEC
            Bevan Goqwana would be "busy like a bee" during the
            November-December circumcision season, "focusing for
            the whole of December on the circumcision thing".</p>

            <p>"We have three helicopters and 400 4x4s on standby,"
            he said. Kupelo said illegal surgeons would find they
            had "no place to hide".</p>

            <p>"We are taking no chances. We rush in, investigate
            and take the person to the police. We have to try by
            all means to avoid these deaths. We want to stop them
            once and for all. It is zero tolerance, we are armed to
            the teeth.</p>

            <p>"It costs a lot to treat an initiate in hospital -
            about R700 a day. From 1995, we estimate it has cost
            more than R10-million to keep initiates in
            hospital."</p>

            <p>He said the 400 medical officers would examine and
            treat the boys in the bush, and take them to hospital
            only if they were in a serious condition.</p>

            <p>There was no budget to build wards for initiates,
            and hospitals were suffering "severe shortages", he
            said.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said the department had rescued about 5 000
            boys during the June-July season.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">"(A total) of 250 would have
            died if they had not got to hospital. As it is, five of
            them lost their manhood. Their penises were amputated
            because they were gangrenous. It is very
            serious."</span></p>

            <p>He said more than 400 traditional surgeons had
            registered their practises since last year in terms of
            the act, which also requires surgeons keep records of
            the boys and get their parents' permission.</p>

            <p>"Those are the ones who came forward. We capacitated
            them and trained them in health standards and gave them
            equipment and chemicals to sterilise their
            instruments."</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Kupelo said if stringent
            hygiene was not applied, circumcision with one
            instrument of 20 to 100 boys could spread HIV and
            Aids.</span></p>

            <p>He said the department was not advocating an end to
            the tradition.</p>

            <p>"We are not custodians. We are enforcing the law.
            They must do it legally; comply with the act. If they
            follow the rules, we won't touch them."</p>
