      <h2>Most Penile Adhesions Resolve Spontaneously After
      Neonatal Circumcision</h2>

      <p>WESTPORT, Aug 03 (Reuters Health) - Penile adhesions are
      common after neonatal circumcision, but most do not require
      any intervention, according to researchers from the Cleveland
      Clinic Foundation, in Ohio.</p>

      <p>Dr. Lee E. Ponsky and colleagues looked for penile
      adhesions in all circumcised boys who presented to their
      pediatric urology clinic. In total, 254 boys were examined,
      ranging in age from 1 month to 19 years, 8 months.</p>

      <p>The prevalence of penile adhesions declined with age, the
      investigators found. All told, 71% of infants had adhesions
      compared with 28% of boys ages 1 to 5 years, 8% of those ages
      5 to 9 years and 2% of older boys. About one third of infants
      had adhesions more severe than grade 1, compared with 10% of
      boys ages 1 to 5 years and none of the boys older than 5
      years.</p>

      <p>Seven of the patients had been treated for adhesions, and
      three of these had recurrences, Dr. Ponsky and colleagues
      note.</p>

      <p>The findings indicate that most penile adhesions resolve
      spontaneously with time, the researchers write. Although the
      study did not address the reasons for spontaneous resolution,
      they point out that possible mechanisms include "an increased
      number of erections with age, penile growth, hormonal
      influence on local tissue and keratin pearl formation."</p>

      <p>Based on their findings, the Cleveland researchers advise
      against routine lysing of penile adhesions, except perhaps
      when they involve the circumcision line. "Adhesions that
      involve the circumcision line may be more likely to cause
      skin bridges," they note.</p>
