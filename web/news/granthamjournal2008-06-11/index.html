            <h2>Doctor 'botched baby's circumcision'</h2>

            <p>An Enfield doctor botched a circumcision on a Muslim
            baby, leaving him with "abnormal" looking genitals, a
            hearing has been told.<br />
            <br />
             The procedure left the five-and-a-half month old
            infant with a "two-tone" coloured penis, the <a
            href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/" target="_blank">General
            Medical Council</a> heard. Dr Anthonipillai
            Nicholas-Pillai denied unprofessional conduct when he
            appeared before the GMC in central London.<br />
            <br />
             The child's Muslim parents, who are of Somalian
            origin, took the baby and his brother, then six, to <a
            href="http://www.information-britain.co.uk/showPlace.cfm?Place_ID=52662"
             target="_blank">Bush Hill Park Medical Centre</a> in
            April 2001 to have the operation conducted for
            religious reasons.<br />
            <br />
             The panel heard how the baby's mother discovered
            abnormalities when bathing her child the morning after
            the circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             The child's father told the Fitness to Practise
            hearing: "The bandage really fell off when she put him
            in the water and she saw that it was a very abnormal
            penis. It was kind of reddish. There was still a bit of
            green but no glans."<br />
            <br />
             The couple returned to the surgery to see Dr
            Nicholas-Pillai the next day.<br />
            <br />
             After examining the baby, the doctor reassured the
            child's parents that everything was satisfactory and
            prescribed a cream for them to use on the child.
            However, the parents were dissatisfied and made several
            trips to their local GP and the Accident and Emergency
            Department of <a href="http://www.bcf.nhs.uk/"
            target="_blank">Chase Farm Hospital</a>, Enfield
            between the months of April and July. A revision
            procedure took place on July 25, 2001.<br />
            <br />
             Baby A's father said his son's penis is still two-tone
            in colour. "Physically it won't affect him but the
            colour is not there. We are not sure how it will affect
            him psychologically."<br />
            <br />
             The Bangalore-trained doctor denies charges of acting
            unprofessionally and below the standard of a reasonably
            competent medical practitioner.</p>
