      <h1>Cairo court scraps govt ban on circumcising girls</h1>

      <p>07:27 a.m. Jun 24, 1997 Eastern</p>

      <p>By Miral Fahmy</p>

      <p>CAIRO, June 24 (Reuter) - An Egyptian court championed the
      radical Islamist cause against the government on Tuesday by
      declaring null and void a ministerial ban on the ancient and
      dangerous practice of female circumcision.</p>

      <p>The verdict was a blow to human rights groups and other
      activists, who said it gave hospitals and doctors the green
      light to perpetuate the practice, often known as female
      genital mutilation for the severe form it takes.</p>

      <p>Right-wing Islamist sheikh Youssef el-Badri, a former MP
      who took Health Minister Ibrahim Sallam to court last year
      for issuing the ``un-Islamic'' ban, beamed triumphantly at
      reporters after the verdict. The court had seen the light, he
      said.</p>

      <p>``I will prostrate myself before Allah, thanking him for
      inspiring the court to take this decision. This is a return
      to Islam,'' said Badri.</p>

      <p>A veiled woman ululated and the mostly male crowd
      cheered.</p>

      <p>``Circumcision is Islamic; the court has said that the ban
      violated religious law. There's nothing which says
      circumcision is a crime but the Egyptians came along and said
      that Islam is a crime. This is a disaster.''</p>

      <p>But rights activists say the court ruling is the real
      disaster. It stems from a power struggle between opponents of
      female circumcision and doctors whose livelihood depends on
      performing the operations, they add.</p>

      <p>``I'm in shock. This is extremely painful, particularly
      after all the work we have done in trying to eradicate this
      procedure. But this ruling will not stop our campaign,'' said
      Maha Attiya, coordinator of the anti-circumcision campaign
      launched by the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights.</p>

      <p>Female circumcision, usually performed on pre-pubescent
      girls, involves cutting part or all of the clitoris and other
      genitalia. It sometimes involves sewing the vaginal opening
      or even the labia together and side-effects include
      haemorrhage, shock and sexual dysfunction.</p>

      <p>Mohammed Sayyed Tantawi, head of the prestigious al-Azhar
      Islamic institute, has said the practice is un-Islamic, but
      some clerics base their case for the the practice on an
      unauthenticated saying of the Prophet Mohammad, which appears
      to favour trimming the clitoris.</p>

      <p>Women's rights activists estimate around 6,000 girls a day
      across the world are subjected to female circumcision.
      According to a government study performed earlier this year,
      97 percent of 14,779 Egyptian women polled had been
      circumcised.</p>

      <p>``It's a way of controlling the bodies of women,'' said Dr
      Siham Abdel Salam of the non-governmental Egyptian Society
      for Population and Development. ``The human body as it is now
      is not a disease. It's how God created it.''</p>

      <p>``It's our religion,'' said Badri. ``We pray, we do
      fasting, we do circumcision. For 14 centuries of Islam, our
      mothers and grandmothers have performed this operation. Those
      who are not circumcised get AIDS easily.''</p>

      <p>Although the court threw out the ban, it did not rule out
      regulating female circumcision operations, saying that they
      must be made illegal by law and not just by decree.</p>

      <p>But the verdict follows a series of other rulings which
      have helped gain ground for Islamists seeking to transform
      Egypt into their strict version of a Moslem state.</p>

      <p>Last year, a Cairo court ruled that a happily married
      professor must divorce his wife because his writings proved
      he was an apostate. Professor Nasr Abu Zeid and his wife are
      living outside Egypt because under Islamic law apostasy is
      punishable by death.</p>

      <p>Islamists also successfully banned an internationally
      acclaimed film they said chronicled the life of the prophet
      Joseph. The depiction of prophets is also taboo.</p>

      <p>The government can appeal against the ruling, made by a
      junior administrative court in Cairo.</p>
