            <h2>Peeling back the facts on the cruelest cut of
            all</h2>

            <p>Snippets of information wafting into Japan suggest
            that it may be about time to cut out the long-held
            belief that circumcision is vital for men's health, one
            of the country's top urologists tells Shukan Gendai
            (10/1).</p>

            <p>Phimosis is the word used to describe the condition
            where the foreskin can't be pulled back over the top of
            the glans, and it's long been a topic of discussion in
            Japan's weeklies. Common belief here has it that the
            problem can easily be solved through circumcision, but
            growing numbers of Japanese physicians are arguing that
            it's no longer necessary to inflict the "cruelest cut
            of all" to solve the condition.</p>

            <p>"It's a big mistake to have made phimosis such a
            problem in the first place. Medically, there's
            absolutely nothing wrong at all," Eiji Ishikawa, head
            of the Ishikawa Clinic and one of Japan's most
            prominent urologists, tells Shukan Gendai. <span
            class="yellow">"Actually, phimosis is more like the
            natural condition and there're more health problems
            involved when lopping off the foreskin. Western views
            on this condition have changed drastically over the
            past 30 years."</span></p>

            <p>There are two types of phimosis. One where the
            foreskin can be peeled back under certain conditions
            and the other where it remains like a hood no matter
            what happens. In the latter case, circumcision is the
            only answer, but for the vast majority of cases --
            Ishikawa says only about seven in every 10,000 cases
            require surgery -- it should be left alone. Even so,
            demand for operations -- effectively circumcisions
            performed on boys and men instead of babies -- remains
            extremely high in Japan.</p>

            <p>"We get loads of mothers coming into the clinic
            asking for their sons to be snipped. They say things
            like 'It looks awful,' 'He'll be ashamed to grow up and
            still look like this,' 'It's unclean,' and 'All the
            other moms from daycare say they can peel their sons'
            back,'" Ishikawa says, adding that most of his patients
            are now middle-aged instead of the younger men who once
            sought the procedure. "Up until recently, grown adults
            seeking circumcision had largely been in their 20s and
            30s. Most of them had just found a girlfriend and were
            terrified that they would be exposed for being unable
            to expose the tip of their penis. Now, though, most of
            the people seeking help are already married. I've even
            had one guy who said he wanted his foreskin cut off
            because he was embarrassed that other members of his
            golf club would be able to see it."</p>

            <p>Circumcision has a millennia-old history, with even
            Egyptian mummies from 4,000 years BC showing that they
            had undergone the cut. Apart from religious regions,
            the main reason it remains practiced today is because
            of archaic beliefs carried over from Victorian
            times.</p>

            <p>"It's mainly about preventing masturbation. The
            belief was that circumcised men masturbated less. In
            19th century Europe and the United States, masturbation
            was blamed for a whole variety of ailments such as
            memory loss, laziness, tuberculosis, heart disease,
            paralysis and attention disorder," Ishikawa tells
            Shukan Gendai. But the urologist argues that, from a
            medical viewpoint, circumcision can be dangerous.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Cutting off the skin at the tip
            can destroy nerve endings that are every bit as
            sensitive as places like the fingers and the tip of the
            tongue," he says.Ishikawa argues that it has become
            common now in some countries for circumcised men to try
            and regenerate their foreskins.</span></p>

            <p>Other experts aren't convinced that attitudes can
            change so easily.</p>

            <p>"Phimosis in Japan is probably a lot more mental
            than physical," Hideo Yamanaka, head of the Toranomon
            Hibiya Clinic in Tokyo, says. "I had one guy in his 70s
            ask me for a circumcision because he couldn't stand the
            idea of somebody seeing he had phimosis even after he'd
            died."</p>

            <p>Ishikawa reluctantly agrees.</p>

            <p>"Japanese men's phimosis phobia has fairly deep
            roots," he tells Shukan Gendai. "Some people have even
            been driven into depression by it. In those cases, I
            think it's probably a better idea to circumcise." (By
