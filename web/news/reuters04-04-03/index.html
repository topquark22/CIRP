            <p><i>Last Updated: 2003-04-04 1:00:16 -0400 (Reuters
            Health)</i></p>

            <p>LONDON (Reuters Health) - The <a
            href="http://www.bma.org.uk/" target="_blank">British
            Medical Association</a> (BMA) issued new circumcision
            <a href="/library/statements/bma2003/">guidelines</a>
            on Friday in an effort to help doctors negotiate the
            ethics of what it calls an increasingly controversial
            area.</p>

            <p>The guidance says there is significant disagreement
            about whether circumcision is beneficial, harmful or
            neutral when it comes to boys' health, and that parents
            have the right to make choices about what is in their
            child's best interest.</p>

            <p>Circumcision for medical purposes is rarely
            controversial, the BMA says, but it points out that the
            <a href="http://www.baps.org.uk/"
            target="_blank">British Association of Paediatric
            Surgeons</a> advises that there is rarely a clinical
            need for the procedure.</p>

            <p>In the case of non-therapeutic circumcision for
            religious or cultural reasons, the ethical situation is
            less straightforward.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">"Circumcision of male babies
            and children at the request of their parents is an
            increasingly controversial area and strongly opposing
            views about circumcision are found within society and
            within the BMA's membership,"</span> the document
            says.</p>

            <p>"The medical harms or benefits have not been
            unequivocally proven except to the extent that there
            are clear risks of harm if the procedure is done
            inexpertly."</p>

            <p>It is legal to perform non-therapeutic circumcision
            so long as it is done competently, is thought to be in
            the child's best interests and valid consent has been
            obtained, the BMA says.</p>

            <p>Boys old enough to express a view should be involved
            in the decision about being circumcised, but if they
            are not old enough, then both parents should agree.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">"If a child presents with only
            one parent, the doctor must make every effort to
            contact the other parent in order to seek
            consent,"</span> the guidelines say.</p>

            <p>Doctors who have a conscientious objection are under
            no obligation to comply with a request to circumcise a
            child. They should explain this to the child and his
            parents, the BMA concludes.</p>
