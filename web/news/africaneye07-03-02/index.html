            <p><b>Riot Hlatshwayo</b></p>

            <p>Polokwane - Altogether 630 initiates, including some
            as young as eight, have been rescued from bogus
            initiation schools in Limpopo in the past week and
            taken to various hospitals.</p>

            <p>MEC in the office of <a
            href="http://www.gov.za/profiles/ramatlhodi.htm"
            target="blank">Premier Ngoako Ramatlhodi</a>, Catherine
            Mabuza, accompanied emergency ambulance services and
            police in armoured vehicles on Tuesday and closed down
            six more schools in the Waterberg district in the
            Mokopane area.</p>

            <p>"The government transported 300 initiates in
            ambulances from the schools to local hospitals," said
            Mabuza's spokesperson Lucky Nchabeleng.</p>

            <p>Nine schools were also closed in the Tzaneen and
            Vhembe area last week for operating without government
            authorisation and 330 initiates were taken to
            hospital.</p>

            <p>The clampdown on initiation schools follows the
            death of 19-year-old Mazka Kgatla who bled to death
            after being circumcised at Mokgolobotho village
            initiation school near Tzaneen last week.</p>

            <p>Nchabeleng has warned that more illegal initiation
            schools may be closed down this week.</p>

            <p>"The clampdown will continue until the government
            has closed down all illegal schools in the province,"
            he said.</p>

            <p>He said that in terms of the initiation schools
            regulation act, these schools need to be authorised by
            the government and have to be linked to a nearby
            hospital or a clinic.</p>

            <p>"Health officials inspect the schools and ensure
            that circumcision is done under hygienic conditions,"
            Nchabeleng said. - African Eye News Service</p>
