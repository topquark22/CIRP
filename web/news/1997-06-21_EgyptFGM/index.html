      <p>08:38 a.m. Jun 21, 1997 Eastern</p>

      <p>CAIRO, June 21 (Reuter) - Egyptian prosecutors issued a
      warrant on Saturday for the arrest of a Cairo doctor after an
      11-year-old girl died under anaesthesia for a circumcision he
      was about to perform.</p>

      <p>Amal Sayyed Bayyoumi went into a coma after receiving the
      anaesthetic in the doctor's clinic on Friday and died shortly
      afterwards, judicial sources said.</p>

      <p>Her mother had taken her to the doctor, Abdelwahhab
      Mohamed Abdelwahhab, for the operation, which remains common
      for girls in Egypt despite the government's attempts to stamp
      it out.</p>

      <p>Last year at least three Egyptian girls were reported to
      have died during circumcision, also known as female genital
      mutilation for the severe form it often takes.</p>

      <p>The judicial sources said the doctor was wanted for
      questioning on possible manslaughter charges. The mother had
      agreed to pay the doctor 60 pounds ($18), they added.</p>

      <p><i>$1 - 3.395 pounds</i></p>
