            <h2>Parents in court over son's circumcision</h2>

            <p>By Cherryh Cluckey<br />
             The Examiner</p>

            <p>A Lee's Summit mother is fighting to prevent her
            3-year-old son's father from having the boy
            circumcised.</p>

            <p>"Several studies have shown that getting it done
            during the phallic state of development is dangerous
            psychologically to the child," said Camille Azar. "They
            see it as castration."</p>

            <p>The boy's father, Ray Jagoda of Leawood, Kan.,
            disagrees. "It's actually better because he will be
            with a doctor under anesthesia," said Jagoda, who has
            full custody of Ethan. "He won't feel any pain."</p>

            <p>Azar was denied an order to protect a child from
            medical harm from the Jackson County Circuit Court and
            was then denied a writ of prohibition from the <a
            href="http://www.courts.mo.gov/appellate/index.nsf/4C7529CAEA2586AD86256480004ECAEC/489D5FC426EC9BB0862568B0006E8115?OpenDocument"
            target="_blank">Court of Appeals</a>.</p>

            <p>She petitioned The <a
            href="http://www.courts.mo.gov/sup/index.nsf"
            target="_blank">Missouri Supreme Court</a>
            Wednesday.</p>

            <p>Jackson County Circuit Judge <a
            href="http://www.16thcircuit.org/Divisions/division.asp?div=31"
            target="_blank">Christine Sill-Rogers</a> gave Jagoda
            full custody of Ethan in May; Azar gets supervised
            visits. They had been sharing custody, but Azar
            previously had full custody.</p>
            Jagoda said Azar is only trying to get attention and
            suffers from mental diseases, which contributed to the
            judge giving him custody of their son.<br />
            <br />
             

            <p>Court documents state Azar suffers from high levels
            of anxiety, nervousness, anger, hostility,
            suspiciousness, and uncooperativeness.</p>

            <p>Azar said she doesn't want Ethan to have anything
            taken away that may be valuable and doesn't want him to
            feel any pain. "We need to wait until he's older and
            let him make the decision for himself," she said.</p>

            <p>The parents saw a doctor at <a
            href="http://www.childrens-mercy.org/"
            target="_blank">Children's Mercy Hospital</a> on Monday
            who said he would not perform the procedure until the
            parents came to an agreement, Azar said.</p>
            "He was wise enough to know the child could pay a
            terrible price," she said.<br />
            <br />
             

            <p>Azar's lawyer, <a
            href="http://www.fedbar.org/padir/OwensD.html"
            target="_blank">Dennis Owens</a>, said it could take a
            few days to a couple of weeks for the Missouri Supreme
            Court to make a ruling.</p>
