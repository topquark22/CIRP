            <h2>Parents of initiation boys face arrest</h2>
            <hr color="brown" />

            <p>Eastern Cape [Province] Health MEC Bevan Goqwana has
            pledged to have the parents of boys killed or maimed
            during circumcisions arrested along with negligent
            traditional surgeons and nurses.</p>

            <p>His department would take the lead in laying
            criminal charges against those responsible for botched
            circumcisions "if parents fail to act", he said.</p>

            <p>Goqwana said, after a visit to candidate initiates
            at Umtata Hospital with provincial initiation programme
            co-ordinator Zweliphakamile Dweba, that all those in
            the hospital had been beaten at initiation schools and
            were bleeding from open wounds when admitted.</p>

            <p>One of the boys will have both legs amputated after
            he was beaten up, allegedly by his traditional nurse
            (amakhankatha).</p>

            <p>The youngest candidate in the hospital at present is
            a 12-year-old boy suffering from gangrene and there are
            at least nine other boys aged 16 and 17 years, while
            the law states that boys younger than 18 may only be
            circumcised in exceptional cases.</p>

            <p>Goqwana lambasted lax parents for the growing number
            of deaths and injuries, saying they had to take
            responsibility for their children.</p>

            <p>Laying the blame at the door of parents, he said:
            "These boys and their parents do not know the law or
            are ignorant and these boys themselves are afraid to
            report to their parents on the bad treatment they
            receive.</p>

            <p><span>"We have taken a decision that the parents of
            these boys are also going to be arrested, together with
            the surgeons and nurses," Goqwana promised.</span></p>

            <p>A special ward for initiation candidates was opened
            at the hospital as the numbers increased daily.</p>

            <p>Dweba was also going to hold meetings with police in
            the area to inform them about the law governing the
            custom.</p>
