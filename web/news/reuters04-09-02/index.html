      <h2>Safe Haven Opens for Women in Kenya</h2>
      Tue Apr 9, 3:25 AM ET 

      <p>By MATTHEW J. ROSENBERG,<br />
       Associated Press Writer</p>

      <p>In the heart of Kenya, Mary Solio found refuge from a
      forced marriage but not from female circumcision&mdash;two
      cultural traditions that some women in the Maasai tribe are
      working to change.</p>

      <p>Most of the 61 Maasai girls who arrived last week at the
      V-Day Safe House for Girls came for a short course on the
      consequences of female circumcision.</p>

      <p>But 14 of them, including 16-year-old Solio, have sought
      refuge in the haven that was formally opened Monday by Eve
      Ensler, author of "The Vagina Monologues," the widely
      produced play about women and their bodies.</p>

      <p>A year ago, Solio's parents forced her to undergo
      circumcision, a Maasai right of passage. Within weeks she was
      married to a man more than three times her age, another
      common Maasai tradition. Four months later, she fled into the
      forest, alone and&mdash;though she didn't know it at the
      time&mdash;pregnant.</p>

      <p>She spent the next seven months at a girls school outside
      this small dusty town, about 70 miles west of Nairobi,
      fighting off attempts by her husband and family to force her
      home. Two weeks ago, her baby was born.</p>

      <p>Now she lives at the safe house, where her baby will be
      cared for while she attends school.</p>

      <p>The project was launched by Agnes Pareyio, a 45-year-old
      Maasai women who began visiting villages throughout
      southwestern Kenya a decade ago to educate women about the
      dangers of female circumcision.</p>

      <p>As a member of a local village council, Pareyio noticed
      that many girls were dropping out of school in their early
      teens and discovered it was because of circumcision and
      marriage.</p>

      <p>"When the girls get circumcised, they are considered
      women, they can't go to school anymore," she said. "... If
      they are married, they must stay home and take care of their
      husbands."</p>

      <p>In Maasai circumcision, the clitoris is removed, usually
      without anesthesia. Some women bled to death during the
      procedure, and <a href="/library/disease/HIV/brady1/">others
      were infected with the HIV virus that causes AIDS</a>,
      because the razor blades are unclean, Pareyio said.</p>

      <p>She set out with a large plastic model of a vagina to
      educate to older women and their daughters about the dangers
      of female circumcision.</p>

      <p>Ensler met Pareyio on a trip to Kenya two years ago and
      said it was clear the Maasai woman's "pure will was changing
      this culture ... freeing women."</p>

      <p>Ensler began financing Pareyio's campaign, first buying
      her a vehicle so she could visit more villages, then
      providing the $65,000 for the safe haven&mdash;two cinder
      block buildings with rooms for the girls, offices and a
      cafeteria. Another is in the works.</p>

      <p>"We don't want to be some outsiders coming in here and
      telling people what to do, how to behave," said Ensler. "The
      only way things really change is when people from that
      culture work to change it."</p>

      <p>An estimated 130 million women, most of them in Africa,
      have been subjected to ritual genital cutting. The number is
      believed to grow by up to 2 million each year. The procedure
      ranges from clipping or burning the clitoris to cutting off
      all the outer labia and sewing closed the remaining tissue,
      leaving only a tiny opening.</p>

      <p>The practice is illegal in 18 countries, nine of them in
      Africa. It was outlawed in Kenya earlier this year but is
      still widespread.</p>

      <p>Although figures are not available on the number of Kenyan
      Maasai women circumcised each year, Pareyio says she has seen
      attitudes begin to change among the tribe, which has herded
      cattle in East Africa for generations.</p>

      <p>"Circumcision is very much part of Maasai culture, it will
      not change in a quick amount of time." Pareyio said. "But
      look here today, we have 60 girls who will not be
      circumcised, who will not be forced into marriage. That is a
      change."</p>
