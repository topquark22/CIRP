            <h2>CIRCUMCISE WARNING TO PARENTS</h2>

            <p><b>by Anita Quigley</b></p>

            <p>AUSTRALIA could face a wave of litigation unless
            circumcision is banned, a leading academic said
            yesterday.</p>

            <p>The president of children's welfare group <a
            href="http://www.ozchild.com.au/" target="_blank">Oz
            Child</a>, Dr. Neville Turner claims male circumcision
            is a breach of human rights and leaves parents and
            doctors liable to be sued.</p>

            <p>Dr. Turner, who is also a professor of law at <a
            href="http://www.monash.edu.au/" target="_blank">Monash
            University</a>, describes the once routine procedure as
            ``unnecessary, painful, dangerous and barbarous.''</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Doctors and nurses who perform circumcision
            on infants relying on the consent of parents are taking
            a grave risk&rdquo;, he said.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;If it is ultimately declared to be a void
            consent, then it will have constituted an assault, and
            they could be civilly and criminally liable.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Dr. Turner said the procedure was contrary to
            article 24 (3) of the <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-convention/">
            United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
            Child</a>.</p>

            <p>He has called for immediate Australia-wide
            legislation banning it.</p>

            <p>Dr. Turner says traditional practices should not be
            observed.</p>

            <p>Male circumcision is still commonly practiced by
            Muslim and Jewish communities.</p>

            <p>National Medicare figures showed 15,000
            circumcisions were performed on boys under six months
            during 1993-94.</p>

            <p>On top of this, 400 Jewish circumcisions were
            conducted outside the hospital system in Melbourne in
            1994.</p>

            <p>Dr. Turner said there was evidence that many men
            suffered negative psychological effects as a result of
            being circumcised.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I think doctors are leaving themselves wide
            open for legal action to be taken against them,&rdquo;
            he said.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I'm not suggesting people should rush off to
            court, but parental consent will not be a
            justification.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.ama.com.au/"
            target="_blank">Australia Medical Association</a>'s
            ethics committee chairman, Dr. Keith Woollard, said
            there was no doubt male circumcision was a growing
            legal and ethical problem.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Having looked at both sides of the argument,
            my own view is that there is not sufficient evidence to
            justify it as a routine surgical procedure on otherwise
            healthy people,&rdquo; he said.</p>

            <p>But Dr. Woollard cautions the debate &rdquo;must not
            degenerate into some sort of criticism of Jewish and
            Muslim faiths.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>About 40 per cent of baby boys were circumcised in
            Australia in 1980.</p>

            <p>Today, less than 20 per cent are circumcised.</p>
