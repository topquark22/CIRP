      <h2>Circumcisions no longer necessary: Sask. doctors</h2>

      <p><b>Anne Kyle</b><br />
       Regina Leader Post</p>

      <p>REGINA (CP) - Routine circumcisions on baby boys is an
      unnecessary medical procedure, the <a
      href="http://www.quadrant.net/cpss/">College of Physicians
      and Surgeons of Saskatchewan</a> said Wednesday.</p>

      <p>"For almost <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/cps1975/">2&frac12;
      decades</a> now the <a href="http://www.cps.ca/">Canadian
      Pediatric Society</a> has pointed out there really is no
      research evidence to suggest benefit from the procedure that
      outweighs the risks of performing the procedure," said
      college registrar Dr. Dennis Kendel.</p>

      <p>The college has issued a <a href="http://www.intact.ca/saskmemo.html">memo to doctors</a> urging them to
      discuss the issue with parents and to effectively convey the
      message it is not a recommended procedure.</p>

      <p>Kendel also pointed out the the incidence of infant male
      circumcision in Saskatchewan "is very high compared to some
      other jurisdictions in the country."</p>

      <p><a
      href="http://www.gov.sk.ca/topic-picklists/?05">Provincial
      Health Department</a> figures for 2000-2001 indicate 27.6 per
      cent of infant males were circumcised in Saskatchewan
      compared to 1.5 per cent in Nova Scotia and .6 per cent in
      Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>

      <p>"It is quite a remarkable difference," said Kendel, who
      added a lot of doctors take a neutral position and do
      strictly whatever the parents prefer.</p>

      <p>Kendel said parents often make the decision about their
      child relative to whether the father is circumcised.</p>

      <p>In August 1996 the provincial Health Department deinsured
      the procedure in part because it recognized there were
      relatively few medical indications to support it. <a
      href="http://www.gov.on.ca/health/english/program/ohip/ohip_mn.html">
      The Ontario Health Insurance Plan</a> delisted circumcisions
      last June.</p>

      <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics, the largest pediatrics
      group in the U.S. and Canada, said in a March 1999 <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">report</a> that the
      medical benefits of circumcision aren't compelling enough to
      recommend the procedure routinely.</p>

      <p>"It really isn't good medical practice to perform a
      procedure where there is no evidence of expected benefits and
      there are some real risks," Kendel said.</p>

      <p>"We will begin the process by making sure physicians
      involved in providing that service or influencing the service
      are themselves accurately informed and we will be encouraging
      them to be sure they accurately convey this information to
      parents who may be considering this procedure,'' he said.</p>
