    <h2>N.D. woman challenges male circumcision</h2>
    IN DEPTH:<br />
    Reconsidering<br />
    circumcision<br />
     By Maura Lerner<br />
    Star Tribune Staff Writer 

    <p>For years, Jody McLaughlin of Minot, N.D., has been
    crusading to stop circumcision of baby boys. In her view, it's
    an unnecessary and harmful medical procedure v that's imposed
    on helpless infants against their will. But try as she might,
    she couldn't persuade her state's legislators to take up her
    cause.</p>

    <p>So now, with the help of a Minnesota lawyer, she's trying to
    get around the politicians: She's challenging a recent North
    Dakota law that bans female genital mutilation, saying it is
    unconstitutional because it doesn't protect boys. Today the
    battle moves to a hearing before the U.S. Court of Appeals in
    St. Paul, and her lawyer has vowed to challenge similar laws in
    Minnesota and Congress.</p>

    <p>"We cannot protect one gender against something and not
    protect the other," said McLaughlin, 46, an activist who
    publishes a natural childbirth magazine called the Compleat
    Mother.</p>

    <p>McLaughlin and her lawyer, Zenas Baer of Hawley, Minn., are
    trying to force the public to take a fresh look at an emotional
    issue that touches on law, medicine and religious freedom. Male
    circumcision-- removal of the penis' foreskin--is both a
    medical procedure and a 4,000 year-old religious practice
    sacred to Muslims and Jews.</p>

    <p>It's far more common in the United States than elsewhere,
    largely because of notions that it's a healthy practice.
    Nationwide, more than 60 percent of newborn boys are
    circumcised (about the same percentage as in 1979, but down
    from a high of 95 percent in the 1960s), according to goverment
    statistics. But only a few percent of boys in Europe and Asia
    are circumcised.</p>

    <p>U.S. doctors have debated the benefits and risks for
    decades. For the most part they have considered circumcision
    cosmetic surgery, neither necessary nor harmful. This year--for
    the fourth time in 22 years--the American Academy of Pediatrics
    is reconsidering its neutral position in light of new evidence
    that circumcision could help prevent urinary tract infections
    and sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

    <p>A moral equivalent?</p>

    <p>But activists are trying to put male circumcision in a new
    light by comparing it to female genital mutilation. Sometimes
    known as female circumcision, it is a widely condemned ritual
    common in Africa and the Middle East, done to curb women's
    sexual desire.</p>

    <p>"What's good for the girl is good for the boy," Baer said.
    "In both instances, you have the removal of otherwise healthy
    genital tissue for a purely social, religious or cultural
    reason,"</p>

    <p>Activists argue that circumcision cuts off some of the
    male's most sexually sensitive tissue and exposes babies to the
    threat of unnecessary complications, such as infections. But
    they also say there's great resistance to change.</p>

    <p>"What man wants to admit that the best part of his penis is
    thrown into a trash can?" asked Marilyn Milos, a nurse who runs
    the National Organization of Circumcision Information Resource
    Centers in San Anselmo, Calif. "What mother wants to admit that
    her precious baby's been harmed needlessly? What doctor wants
    to admit he's got blood on his hands?"</p>

    <p>Even some activists against female mutilation see a
    parallel.</p>

    <p>"I'm also sympathetic to their goals, frankly," said Dr.
    Nahib Toubia, whose New York-based group, the Research Action
    and Information Network for Bodily Integrity of Women,
    campaigns against female circumcison. "A health professional
    should never touch a child and remove some normal body
    organ."</p>

    <p>But others say it's unfair to compare male circumcision to
    female genital mutilation. "It is an oppressive practice for
    females," said Rabbi Jonathan Ginsburg, of Temple of Aaron in
    St. Paul and coordinator of the Minnesota Rabbinical
    Association. "The male circumcision . . . we've been doing for
    4,000 years, and we're fine. There's not a single Jewish guy
    who complains about it."</p>

    <p>McLaughlin, who has two grown daughters, tried and failed to
    convince the North Dakota Legislature that the two rituals are
    linked. She and Duane Voskuil, a philosophy professor in
    Bismarck, N.D., drafted a law to ban genital alterations in
    both boys and girls. But when legislators refused to sponsor
    it, she said, they rewrote it to mention girls only. "We knew
    at the time that this bill would be unconstitutional, but it
    passed both houses unanimously," she said.</p>

    <p>They challenged own law.</p>

    <p>Then she and Voskuil joined with Donna Fishbeck, who had a
    newborn son, to challenge the law that McLaughlin and Voskuil
    had written. The North Dakota attorney general's office fought
    back. "The Legislature did not intend to criminalize neonatal
    male circumcision," Doug Bahr, an assistant attorney general,
    argued.</p>

    <p>The anticircumcision activists lost the first round in
    October when a federal judge in Bismarck threw out the case,
    saying the plaintiffs had no legal standing to challenge the
    law.</p>

    <p>But Judge Patrick Conmy wan't entirely unsympathetic. "This
    may very well be a worthwhile goal," he wrote, but "the
    plaintiffs accomplish nothing by this action." If they won, he
    said, they'd merely invalidate the protection for girls. "This
    battle is one for the education of new parents and for the
    legislatures of this [country]-not the courts."</p>

    <p>Although today's court hearing is only on the North Dakota
    law, Baer says he plans to use this as a steppingstone to
    challenge a similar 1994 Minnesota law and a federal law on
    female mutilation that took effect in March.</p>

    <p>These days doctors find themselves walking a fine line,
    especially when parents ask for advice. "As pediatricians we're
    sort of neutral to the idea," said Dr. Mary Meland, a Health
    Partners pediatrician in Bloomington. "But the fact is, there
    are some high quality studies showing there is some medical
    benefit."</p>

    <p>More than 25 years ago, the American Academy of Pediatrics
    declared there were no valid medical reasons for routine
    circumcision. That changed, somewhat, in 1989 after studies
    indicated that circumcision reduced the rate of infant urinary
    tract infections and penile cancer. But those are rare
    conditions, and the group recommended that parents weigh the
    facts and make their own decisions.</p>

    <p>This year the group's task force is evaluating more evidence
    of possible benefits, including reduced risk of sexually
    transmitted diseases. "People feel it's really time to revisit
    and reconsider," said University of North Carolina pediatrician
    Carole Lannon, task force chairwoman.</p>

    <p>Critics dismiss the benefits as myths and say they don't
    outweigh the risks, including bleeding, pain and, in extremely
    rare cases, death.</p>

    <p>But Dr. Howard Stang, a Health Partners pediatrician in
    White Bear Lake, says studies have shown that it's tough to
    talk parents out of the procedure. "In America, it's such an
    ingrained type of practice, it basically comes down to a gut
    feeling," said Stang, whose research helped encourage the
    widespread use of anesthesia during circumcisions.</p>

    <p>"I don't spend a lot of my time trying to talk parents out
    of it," he said. "But I also applaud them for deciding not to
    circumcise their baby. I tell them that's fine, too."</p>
