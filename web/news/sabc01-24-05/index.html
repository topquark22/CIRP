            <h2>Special courts for circumcision offences</h2>
            January 24, 2005, 18:00 

            <p>The Eastern Cape health department is considering a
            multi-pronged approach to deal with botched
            circumcisions, including special courts and arranging
            psychological treatment.</p>

            <p>"We will liaise with all the state law enforcement
            agencies in a bid to have special courts established to
            deal with traditional circumcision offences during this
            year's June/December circumcision seasons," said Sizwe
            Kupelo, the departmental spokesperson in a statement
            today. Kupelo said those who complied with legislation
            governing the custom in the Eastern Cape would be
            further "capacitated" with training and recognition of
            their practices, while those who continued to disregard
            the act would be "severely punished".</p>

            <p>He said departmental officials were conducting
            monitoring and evaluation in order to determine the
            baseline challenges and improve data collection.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said the active approach taken by the
            department two years ago had borne fruit, with the
            closing down of illegal initiation schools leading to
            fewer circumcision casualties.</p>

            <p>He said by hiring additional 4x4 vehicles for
            monitoring, the number of circumcision-related
            fatalities dropped from 33 in 2003 to eight last
            season, with another 77 initiates having genital
            amputations. <span class="yellow">Since 1995, 300 boys
            had died from circumcision-related complications and
            another 6 000 hospitalised.</span> Last season 198
            initiates were admitted to various hospitals, dropping
            from more than 400 the year before. He said the
            department was now arranging for psychological
            treatment to initiates who were hospitalised, following
            two separate incidents where traumatised initiates
            committed suicide fearing victimisation. - Sapa</p>
