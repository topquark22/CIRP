            Tuesday, 09-Jul-2002 6:10AM Story from AFP<br />
             Copyright 2002 by Agence France-Presse 

            <p>STOCKHOLM, July 9 (AFP) - Swedish police are
            investigating four cases of possible female
            circumcision that could lead to the first indictments
            since the practice was banned in Sweden 20 years ago,
            Swedish Radio said Tuesday.</p>

            <p>A prosecutor has been appointed to investigate the
            four cases in the southwestern city of Gothenburg, the
            radio reported. No other details of the cases were
            available.</p>

            <p>Sweden passed a ban on female genital mutilation in
            1982, but not a single case has been brought to trial
            in the 20 years since.</p>

            <p>According to the radio, many families who wanted the
            procedure carried out circumvented the law by having it
            done outside Sweden. As a result, the law was amended
            in 1999 to stipulate that parents could be charged in
            Sweden regardless of where the procedure was done.</p>

            <p>Parents or guardians face a maximum sentence of four
            years, but if the crime is considered aggravated --
            that is, if the girl's life is put in danger or if
            serious illness ensues -- the sentence can be as high
            as 10 years in prison.</p>

            <p>"The most difficult part of uncovering (cases of)
            female circumcision is that it is often within family
            and people don't want to talk about these things,"
            police commissioner Haakan Frank told Swedish
            Radio.</p>

            <p>The practice, which is common in a number of African
            countries, can consist of clitoridectomy (removal of
            the clitoris), excision (removal of the outer labia)
            and infibulation (the partial stitching together of the
            labia, often after the removal of the clitoris).</p>

            <p>The most common reasons given for the practice,
            which is often defended strongly by older women, are
            that it is an important rite of passage for girls to
            womenhood and that it prevents women from being
            promiscuous.</p>

            <p>Others, mainly men, defend the practice arguing that
            it is African tradition and should be preserved.</p>
