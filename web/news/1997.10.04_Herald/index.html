          <h2>DOCTORS WARNED ON SNIP RISKS</h2>

          <p><b>By Honey Webb</b></p>
        </div>

        <p>Doctors who performed circumcision on infant boys were
        at risk of negligence claims if they failed to inform
        parents of all possible side effects, an academic has
        warned.</p>

        <p>In a <a
        href="/library/legal/haberfield/">paper</a>
        presented as part of the <a target="_blank"
        href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/special/alta/">Australasian
        Law Teachers Association</a> Conference in Sydney
        yesterday, Mr Les Haberfield, of the <a
        href="http://www.rmit.edu.au/" target="_blank">Royal
        Melbourne Institute of Technology</a>, said recent court
        rulings on the duty of doctors to inform patients of risks
        of medical procedures could also be applied to
        circumcision.</p>

        <p>These risks could include pain, unsightly appearance,
        damage to the shaft, damage to the urethra, hemorrhage,
        infections, amputation or, rarely, death, he said.</p>

        <p>In 1992, the <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/">High
        Court</a> ruled that surgeons and doctors must advise
        patients of all material risks of operations and treatments
        or face action for negligence if a patient suffered an
        undisclosed side effect.</p>

        <p>Applying that rule, Mr Haberfield said if a circumcision
        went wrong and it could be established that the doctor had
        not informed the parents of the full range of risks, that
        doctor could be found negligent.</p>

        <p>The Australian College of Paediatrics released a <a
        href="/library/statements/acp1996/">statement</a> in 1996,
        saying discussion with parents about potential health
        benefits and risks of circumcision was essential and
        up-to-date, unbiased written material should be made
        available on the issue.</p>
