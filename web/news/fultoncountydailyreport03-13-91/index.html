       <i>Behind the Northside Baby Case Settlement, March 13,
      1991</i><br />
       By Ann Woolner, Fulton County Daily Report 

      <p><font size="5">U</font>ntil a mediator stepped in,
      settlement seemed remote in a case involving a newborn's
      severely botched circumcision at <a
      href="http://www.northside.com/" target="_blank">Northside
      Hospital</a>, plaintiffs' lawyers say.</p>

      <p>Lawyers had been unable to reach a settlement during two
      years of on-and-off negotiations, so they decided to take
      their best evidence to a mediator in Florida, where one of
      the plaintiffs' counsel practices. About 20 people-lawyers
      and their clients-spent Valentine's Day presenting the case
      to the mediator Joan H Bickerstaff of Melbourne, Fla.</p>

      <p>"We were far, far apart prior to mediation," says one of
      the plaintiffs' lawyers, John L Kennedy of Atlanta's <a
      href="http://www.tksp.com/" target="_blank">Thomas, Kennedy,
      Sampson, Edwards &amp; Patterson</a>.</p>

      <p>Within a month, the parties had struck a settlement in the
      5-year-old case. The total package has a present day value of
      roughly $3.7 million, but will be stretched out throughout
      the boy's life. Based on a 65-year life span, the package
      would eventually pay $22.8 million to the child and his
      parents.</p>

      <p>The settlement calls for a $1.1 million immediate payment
      to the child, plus an annuity that makes monthly payments
      that would reach $20.6 million by the time the boy turns 65.
      Under the terms of the settlement, $13.7 million is
      guaranteed to the boy or his estate over the next 30 years.
      Beyond that, he would receive $11,000 a month for as long as
      he lives, according to the settlement papers.</p>

      <p>Also, his parents receive $1 million now, plus a
      structured settlement with a present day value of about
      $200,000.</p>

      <p>Thomas G. Sampson says the plaintiffs' lawyers took the
      case on a contingency basis, but he would not disclose
      details of the arrangement.</p>

      <p>In addition to the payments from this suit, the child and
      his family were given $1.2 million to settle their complaint
      against the physician, according to another of their lawyers,
      Willie E. Gary of Stuart, Fla.</p>

      <p>The new settlement ends litigation that started in <a
      href="http://www.fultoncourt.org/" target="_blank">Fulton
      Superior court</a> soon after hospital personnel used
      allegedly improper equipment to circumcise two newborns on
      Aug.22, 1985.</p>

      <p>The electrocautery machine normally used to circumcise
      infants was out of thermocautery tips, so hospital personnel
      substituted an electrosurgical machine, which the plaintiffs
      allege is not appropriate for neonatal circumcisions. They
      claimed the use of the equipment without following proper
      procedure violated hospital policy, and that personnel were
      not properly trained in its use.</p>

      <p>Both babies were severely burned. The other one, who sued
      and settled under the name "Baby Doe," was so damaged that a
      sex change operation was performed, according to one of the
      child's lawyers, Henry D. Green Jr. of Atlanta's Sullivan,
      Hall, Booth &amp; Smith.</p>

      <p>The parents of that infant, whose identity has not been
      revealed, settled in 1985 or 1986 for an undisclosed sum,
      says Green.</p>

      <p>In the just-settled case, the child's penis was
      "substantially, substantially burned," but not as badly as
      the other infant, according to Sampson. Still, "He lost a
      significant portion of his penis as a result."</p>

      <p>The youngster has undergone reconstructive surgery, and
      more procedures will be attempted as he gets older, Sampson
      says. However, "There's no guarantee in terms of how
      effective any of this surgery will be," he says.</p>

      <p>The plaintiffs' Atlanta lawyers split the work with Gary
      of Gary, Williams &amp; Parenti of Stuart, Fla., near West
      Palm Beach. The family hired Gary, a medical malpractice and
      personal injury lawyer, after reading about him in Ebony
      magazine, he says. Gary handied the damages issues while
      Thomas, Kennedy focused on liability, according to
      Sampson.</p>

      <p>On the defense side were Sidney F. Wheeler and Joseph
      Watkins of Long, Weinberg, Ansley and Wheeler, who
      represented the hospital; and Frederick W. Ajax Jr. and John
      A. Howard of Fortson and White, who represented the
      manufacturer of the equipment, Valley Lab Inc. Under the
      terms of the settlement, the manufacturer pays nothing.</p>

      <p>Watkins declined to discuss the case. Ajax confirmed that
      he had been involved in mediation and that his client was not
      contributing to any settlement.</p>

      <p>Kennedy says the case took this long to resolve in part
      because the plaintiffs' team took it over after the
      plaintiffs' previous lawyer had reached a settlement with the
      physician.</p>

      <p>"Prior to the time we got involved, the doctor settled,"
      says Kennedy. This left an "empty chair" for the hospital to
      blame, says Kennedy. "The hospital felt like there was
      liability, but it was not on them. So we had to go the whole
      nine yards with discovery."</p>

      <p>In addition, a pending motion for summary judgment by the
      manufacturer slowed the pace, according to Sampson.</p>

      <p>But the breakthrough came when "all parties agreed to
      bring the matter to a settlement through the mediation
      process," says Sampson.</p>

      <p>He says before mediation, "It was a consensus to settle
      the case, but we were still apart" on figures.</p>

      <p>They agreed to do it in Florida, where mediation is more
      common. Besides, says Gary, "I wanted them all to come to me.
      You kind of feel like you have a better handle on things on
      your own turf," he says.</p>

      <p>At the mediation session, the lawyers described the
      evidence to support their contentions, including some
      videotaped testimony.</p>

      <p>The mediator then spoke privately with each of the
      parties' lawyers, trying to move them closer together. She
      never came up with a figure, according to Kennedy and
      Sampson, but merely acted as a catalyst to budge the parties
      off their set positions.</p>

      <p>"The mediation process really provided the atmosphere for
      the settlement of the case," says Sampson.</p>
