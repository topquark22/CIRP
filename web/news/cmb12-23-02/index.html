            <h2>Medical Board of California Arrests Santa Clarita
            Resident for Unlicensed Practice of Medicine</h2>

            <p class="text">SACRAMENTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS
            WIRE)--Dec. 23, 2002--The Medical Board of California's
            Operation Safe Medicine (OSM), in conjunction with the
            Federal Bureau of Investigation, served a search
            warrant on December 19, 2002 at the Santa Clarita
            residence of an unlicensed person, Todd Cameron
            Bertrang, for agreeing to perform female circumcisions.
            The procedure is an extremely painful, traumatizing
            mutilation of females that leaves them permanently
            disfigured. He also performs a similar procedure on
            males. He was charged with violating Business and
            Professions Code <a
            href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/bpc/2050%2D2079.html"
             target="_blank">section 2053</a>, a felony, by risking
            great bodily harm, serious injury or death by
            practicing medicine without a license. Bertrang was
            arrested and booked into Santa Clarita Los Angeles
            Sheriff's Department and will appear in court on
            January 21, 2003.</p>

            <p class="text">The Medical Board of California
            continues to analyze evidence obtained during the
            execution of the search warrant. The Board's Chief of
            Enforcement Dave Thornton said, "The mission of the
            Medical Board is consumer protection. Stopping the
            unlicensed practice of medicine in California is a high
            priority with the Medical Board. We encourage anyone
            with information regarding additional victims of Todd
            Bertrang, or any other criminal activity connected to
            Bertrang, to contact the Medical Board's Cerritos
            Office at (562) 860- 2819."</p>

            <p class="text">The case was referred to the Medical
            Board by a physician from Northern California who
            received information that Bertrang was performing
            clitoridectomies on women in Southern California. The
            FBI, who had received a similar complaint, also was
            investigating Bertrang. A joint investigation with the
            FBI resulted in a search warrant being obtained for the
            Santa Clarita residence, along with an arrest warrant
            for Bertrang. The investigation has revealed that
            Bertrang attracted potential patients through Web sites
            and may have performed various unlicensed procedures
            that include male and female circumcisions at his
            residence since 1997. These are procedures that can
            result in serious injury to patients who are not in a
            medical setting.</p>

            <p class="text">This arrest is the tenth in 2002 by
            investigators of Operation Safe Medicine, a special
            unit of the Medical Board composed of trained
            investigators who seek to protect a significant portion
            of the population by reducing access to individuals who
            are unlicensed and a danger to the public when they
            attempt medical treatment. OSM commenced in January
            2001, and works closely with local and federal law
            enforcement agencies. The staff of investigators target
            the known areas where the unlicensed practice of
            medicine flourishes in Orange County and the greater
            Los Angeles area. The investigators also work other
            areas of the state as needed and provide training to
            other Medical Board enforcement staff in how to spot
            and respond to suspected illegal practices.</p>

            <p class="text">OSM is part of the Medical Board's
            efforts to steer consumers away from unlicensed
            practitioners, whose treatment of patients has resulted
            in harm and even death in Southern California. The
            Board encourages the public to confirm they are
            receiving healthcare from licensed individuals by
            calling its Consumer Information Line at (916) 263-2382
            or visiting its Web site at <a

            target="_blank">www.medbd.ca.gov</a>.</p>

            <p>The Medical Board of California is the state agency
            responsible for licensing and regulating physicians in
            this state.</p>
