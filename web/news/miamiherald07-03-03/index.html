            <h2>PAYING FOR CIRCUMCISION<br />
             Medicaid won't cover elective procedures</h2>

            <p><b>BY ELINOR J. BRECHER</b><br />
             <a
            href="mailto:ebrecher@herald.com">ebrecher@herald.com</a></p>

            <p>Florida Medicaid patients who want their newborn
            boys circumcised will have to pay for it themselves
            unless it's done right after delivery and is billed as
            part of that process.</p>

            <p>Medicaid will still pay for the procedure --
            surgical removal of the foreskin -- at any time if a
            doctor deems it medically necessary, usually due to
            infection, injury or abnormality that impairs
            function.</p>

            <p>The rule change went into effect Tuesday and was
            passed by the Legislature as a cost-cutting
            measure.</p>

            <p>Out-of-pocket, an elective circumcision might cost
            between $400-$1,000, depending on the age of the child,
            according to an informal survey of South Florida
            pediatric surgeons, urologists and obstetricians.</p>

            <p>Newborns don't need anesthesia; older children do,
            increasing the cost of the procedure.</p>

            <p>The lower end of the scale is about what South
            Florida <i>mohels</i> -- practitioners, usually rabbis,
            who perform the procedure ritually on 8-day-old Jewish
            boys -- are paid.</p>

            <p>Muslims also ritually circumcise, but later in a
            child's life.</p>

            <p>Medicaid is a state program that pays some medical
            expenses for the poor. Florida is the 11th state to
            drop elective circumcision coverage.</p>

            <p>The rule is designed to save the state $2.3 million
            a year.</p>

            <p>That's what 14,420 circumcisions cost in 2001-2002,
            including $122,656 for 677 circumcisions in Broward
            County and $106,630 for 659 in Miami-Dade, according to
            state Medicaid records.</p>

            <p>It's unclear how many procedures were done as part
            of the delivery or some time thereafter. Department
            records show that Medicaid covered 12,585 circumcisions
            of babies less than a year old and 384 for children 1-2
            years old. The remainder were done on Medicaid
            recipients of all ages, up to 79.</p>

            <p>The records also do not provide a breakdown of how
            many circumcisions were elective or medically
            necessary.</p>

            <p>Circumcision, a procedure dating back about 4,000
            years, became popular in the mid-1800s, when it was
            thought to promote better hygiene and deter
            masturbation.</p>

            <p>It was once nearly universal in the United States
            but began to decrease in popularity after the American
            Academy of Pediatrics declared in <a
            href="/library/statements/aap/#a1971">1971</a> that it
            held no health benefits.</p>

            <p>Nationwide, according to the <a
            href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/"
            target="_blank">National Center for Health
            Statistics</a>, about 60 percent of baby boys undergo
            the procedure, which some doctors consider unsafe and
            anti-circumcision activists consider an emotionally
            damaging mutilation.</p>

            <p>Its advocates, however, say that it's a prudent
            hygiene measure that reduces the risk of urinary-tract
            infection.</p>

            <p>Four years ago the American Academy of Pediatrics
            recommended against routine circumcision because the
            potential medical benefits, including a decreased risk
            of urinary-track infections and penile cancer, were not
            significant.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.ajcongress.org/"
            target="_blank">American Jewish Congress</a>, which
            monitors church/state matters, took no position on the
            Florida legislation.</p>

            <p>''We don't think that per se this decision is
            something we'd oppose,'' said chief information officer
            David Twerksy, from his New York office. ``But there's
            no question there's a move among some in the medical
            community to outlaw it [so] if this budgetary decision
            would presage an anti-circumcision move, we'd express
            vigorous opposition.''</p>

            <p>South Florida <i>mohel</i> Michael Andron says it
            takes him about 10 seconds to perform the procedure
            during a <i>brit milah</i>: circumcision ceremony. It
            takes doctors in hospitals 10 minutes, he says, because
            they use different tools.</p>

            <p>Religious circumcisions were never covered under
            state Medicaid guidelines.</p>

            <p>Ronald Goldman, who has written two books decrying
            the procedure, doesn't advocate outlawing circumcision
            but hopes it will die out as Americans become convinced
            there's no benefit to it.</p>

            <p>Executive director of the Boston-based <a
            href="http://www.circumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Circumcision Resource Center</a>,
            Goldman notes that 80 percent of the world's population
            doesn't practice circumcision.</p>
