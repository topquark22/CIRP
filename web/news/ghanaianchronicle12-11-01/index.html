      <h2>Human Rights Violations: CHRAJ Commissioner Calls for
      Tougher Action</h2>

      <p><b>Thello B. Garblah &amp; Abdul Hakim Ahmed</b></p>

      <p>The Commissioner of Human Rights and Administrative
      Justice (<a
      href="http://hrw.org/reports/2001/africa/ghana/ghana.html">CHRAJ</a>)
      Mr. Emile Short has called on the Inspector General of Police
      and Attorney General to strictly enforce laws criminalizing
      <b>female genital mutilation</b> and all other forms of
      customary servitude, such as the infamous trokosi system, in
      which vestal virgins, are held in slavery in atonement for
      alleged transgressions of their family members.</p>

      <p>Giving an appraisal on 'The state of human rights in Ghana
      2001' at a press conference yesterday to mark the 53rd Human
      Rights Day celebration in Accra, Mr. Short lamented that
      since the law criminalizing the Trokosi system was enacted in
      1998, not a single prosecution has taken place, even though a
      large number of women and children still remain in
      bondage.</p>

      <p>The Commission therefore called on the government to
      ensure that the legislative enactments criminalizing these
      practices are enforced.</p>

      <p>Mr. Short further deplored the inhumane treatment meted
      out to women and girls through the practice of widowhood
      rites, ritual servitude, female genital mutilation and other
      cultural and traditional practices, which tend to have
      devastating consequences on the victims, and condemned in no
      uncertain terms the recent alleged forced circumcision of
      five girls at Gboa, near Banda Ahenkro (Banda traditional
      area).</p>

      <p>Considering the theme for this year's celebration
      "Consolidating Democracy Through the Advancement of Women 's
      and Children's Rights," Mr. Short expressed disgust at the
      international trade of women and girls who stand the risk of
      unwanted pregnancies, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases
      and other forms of violence.</p>

      <p>He, however, reaffirmed his support for the Attorney
      General and Minister of Justice on his proposed Anti-Human
      Trafficking Unit within the ECOWAS region and for the
      requisite legislation and legal framework to sanction harsher
      punishments for internationally organized criminal groups
      involved in trafficking.</p>

      <p>Touching on the conditions in Ghana's prisons and the
      plight of the detained and other vulnerable persons, the
      Commissioner bewailed the conditions in the prisons, noting
      they woefully fall short of the UN Standard Rules for the
      treatment of prisoners.</p>

      <p>He identified the imposition of custodial sentences for
      minor offences, the inability of the court to expedite trial
      of suspects who have been remanded in prison custody, the
      incidence of incarceration of juveniles into adult prison,
      the conviction and committal into prison of nursing mothers
      and pregnant women, among others, as the problems that beset
      the country's justice system.</p>

      <p>Mr. Short, however, applauded the government for commuting
      to life imprisonment the sentences of some condemned
      prisoners.</p>

      <p>The Commission also expressed its concern about the
      increasing violation of human rights of Ghanaian workers by
      employers, including foreign nationals and expatriates, some
      of whom have subjected some of their employees to undignified
      treatment.</p>

      <p>He urged all victims of any inhuman and degrading
      treatment by their employers to lodge complaints with the
      commission.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the UN Secretary General, Dr. Kofi Annan, in a
      message read on his behalf by the UNDP Resident
      Representative, Dr. Edward Fawundu, warned that widespread
      violations of human rights in any state are a danger that
      there is conflict is on the horizon.</p>

      <p>He said if only nations can heed this early warning and
      take early action to uphold human rights, then can they save
      the people of that state. Dr. Annan reiterated his call for a
      united action against terrorism, stating that it has a
      universal human right dimension.</p>

      <p>He therefore urged all to work harder than ever to defeat
      racism and discrimination.</p>
