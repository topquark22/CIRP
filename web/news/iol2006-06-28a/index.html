            <p>Another circumcision initiate has died in Libode in
            the Eastern Cape, bringing the tally to eight in two
            weeks since the start of the winter initiation season,
            the provincial health department said on
            Wednesday.<br />
            <br />
             Spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said the boy was found dead
            at an initiation school at Sbangweni village in Libode
            just after 2am on Wednesday morning.<br />
            <br />
             The exact cause of death was not yet known.<br />
            <br />
             He said the boys often die of infection, gangrene or
            sepsis. He said the boys steal chickens from villages
            (to pay the "surgeons") and go to these schools, where
            they stand in a queue to be circumcised.<br />
            <br />
             "Our worry, is that apart from dying, there is a high
            possibility that the boys would end up contracting
            HIV," said Kupelo.<br />
            <br />
             On Monday, another boy died following a botched
            circumcision. Another boy, from Ngqeleni near Mthatha,
            faces possible amputation.<br />
            <br />
             "These boys are dying but are not supposed to die,"
            said Kupelo, urging the community not to wait until the
            eleventh hour before reporting suspicious
            practices.<br />
            <br />
             He said seven illegal surgeons have been arrested. Two
            were released due to a technicality, but could possibly
            be recharged.<br />
            <br />
             One of the two was being sought in connection with the
            death of the Port Shepstone boy, said Kupelo. -
