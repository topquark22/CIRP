            chancers' racket</h2>

            <p>THOZI ka MANYISANA</p>

            <p>RACKETEERING <i>iingcibi</i> (traditional surgeons)
            have been accused of corrupting the traditional rite by
            charging huge fees of up to R1 000 just for "the
            cut".</p>

            <p>Health department circumcision co-ordinator
            Zweliphakamile Dweba said at a provincial circumcision
            review in King William's Town that the rite was being
            turned into a business after it became evident that
            <i>iingcibi</i>, themselves circumcised as recently as
            June, saw the custom as a way to pocket a quick
            buck.</p>

            <p>The review was attended by some 50 traditional
            nurses, surgeons and health department officials.</p>

            <p>Dweba said the price of the previously cheap
            exercise had now sky-rocketed.</p>

            <p>An <i>ingcibi</i> from Mount Ayliff, who spoke on
            condition of anonymity, confirmed that they charged
            between R850 and R1 000 a cut.</p>

            <p>He said the custom had changed from the way it used
            to be carried out before.</p>

            <p>"In the good old days," he said, a traditional
            surgeon would not be the traditional nurse at the same
            time. But thanks to greed, that has changed as iingcibi
            are "doing multi jobs because they want multi
            money".</p>

            <p>The already expensive operation fee excluded all
            other expenses, like the goat or sheep to be
            slaughtered as part of the custom. Necessities like
            groceries have to be catered for by the initiate's
            parents.</p>

            <p>An initiate must also fork out an additional R250 a
            month for attending a traditional circumcision
            school.</p>

            <p>The surgeons have also been accused of keeping the
            circumcised youths as their prisoners until the
            families pay their grossly inflated bills.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the provincial health department, already
            under pressure because of the high number of deaths and
            maimings resulting from botched circumcisions, has
            introduced a new stainless-steel blade to ensure the
            cuts are done hygienically.</p>

            <p>The blade is supplied to traditional surgeons free
            of charge and is meant to be cleaned after each cut is
            done.</p>

            <p>During the review, however, one health worker said
            he was reluctant to supply the department's alternative
            circumcision instruments to the surgeons in his
            region.</p>

            <p>He said practitioners were doing brisk business and
            giving them free instruments would be fuelling the
            "evil deed".</p>

            <p>"They are making money out of this."</p>

            <p>He said problems with the traditional Xhosa custom
            were also caused by the sudden interest shown by other
            tribes like the AmaBhaca and AmaXesibe , who were not
            previously undergoing the rite. - ECN Weekend</p>
