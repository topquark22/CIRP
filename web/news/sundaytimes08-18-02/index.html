            <h2>Cut Me Out, Says Gospel Star</h2>

            <p>by Lesley Mofokeng</p>

            <p>GOSPEL star Lundi Tyamara has enraged
            traditionalists by announcing that he will not undergo
            the Xhosa circumcision ceremony.</p>

            <p>But the 23-year-old star has won support for his
            stand from other prominent men, who revealed this week
            that they too had refused to submit to tradition.</p>

            <p>They include soccer star Brian Baloyi, DJ Glen Lewis
            and jazz star Selaelo Selota.</p>

            <p>Tyamara insisted this week that his lifestyle did
            not allow for the tradition which entails young men
            being circumcised and remaining in isolation with other
            initiates for some three weeks, at the end of which
            they are considered to be men.</p>

            <p>He said was too busy earning a living to take time
            out for the ceremony. He also feared for his health and
            safety at an initiation school. He insisted that he did
            practise other Xhosa traditions. "I do not disrespect
            my culture."</p>

            <p>Baloyi, Bafana Bafana and Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper,
            said he sympathised with Tyamara. He revealed that he
            did not undergo circumcision as required in Shangaan
            tradition because of soccer commitments. He was already
            playing for the Kaizer Chiefs junior side as a
            teenager.</p>

            <p>"Honestly, I never had time to go to the bush
            although lots of my friends in Alexandra went. But I
            had to make a choice between that and soccer. I chose
            soccer," he said.</p>

            <p>"I feel that people have to face reality and
            acknowledge that some things can't be done like our
            elders did in the past, because of today's living
            conditions," he said.</p>

            <p>Metro FM and club DJ Lewis said: "I know my father
            had a problem with me not going to the bush, but it
            went away. <span>People are dying in the bush
            anyway.</span>"</p>

            <p>Retired boxing champion Baby Jake Matlala said he
            had also not undergone the tradition as required in
            Pedi custom, but had opted for a quicker solution by
            going to hospital.</p>

            <p>"I support circumcision when it's done in the
            hospital. <span>The dangers that go with initiation
            schools have really turned us against the idea,"</span>
            he said.</p>

            <p>Award-winning jazz musician and producer Selota said
            he too had not undergone the circumcision ceremony.</p>

            <p><span>"What's the use of going to the mountain and
            claiming to practise a culture that is already
            eroded?</span> The world has become Westernised and
            there is no platform to practise what you have been
            taught at the initiation school," he said.</p>

            <p>Tyamara has also gathered some heavyweight
            detractors.</p>

            <p>Dr Mathole Motshekga, former Gauteng premier and now
            head of the Kara Heritage Institute, which specialises
            in African culture, said there was no basis for Tyamara
            to refuse to undergo the tradition.</p>

            <p>"There are basic rules of life that have to be
            followed and deviating from them leads to serious
            problems like moral degeneration.</p>

            <p>"Our children don't go to circumcision schools, they
            watch American films, and that's why we have so much
            moral degeneration. Initiation cannot be rejected in
            the name of modernity," he said.</p>

            <p>Chief Phathekile Holomisa, chairman of the
            organisation of traditional leaders, Contralesa, said:
            "It's his democratic right not to go, but he will
            always be considered a boy, even when he is old and
            grey. He will scandalise any woman he will marry
            because a woman cannot marry a boy," he said.</p>

            <p>"Lundi is not a man to me, he is an inkwenkwe (young
            boy)," said Yfm DJ and Celebrity Big Brother housemate
            Thomas "Bad Boy T" Msengana, who underwent the ceremony
            when he was 20 in Langa township outside Cape Town.</p>

            <p>"This is one thing we cannot afford to let go. If
            this dies, what else would we have?"</p>

            <p>SABC1 continuity presenter Brian Ndevu warned
            Tyamara that he would have problems in future if he
            refused to honour the obligation.</p>

            <p>"That could have serious consequences. This is a
            rite of passage to manhood for every Xhosa man," he
            said, adding: "By not going there you can never enter
            the circles of Xhosa men."</p>
