            <h4>Tried to hide error from parents</h4>
            Tue Jul 18 2006 

            <p><b>By Jen Skerritt</b></p>

            <p>A Winnipeg doctor, who didn't check a newborn's
            identification before <a target="_blank"
            href="/news/canadacom11-18-05/">a circumcision was
            performed on the wrong baby</a> at <a
            href="http://www.sbgh.mb.ca/" target="_blank">St.
            Boniface General Hospital</a>, later duped the baby's
            parents into believing the operation wasn't performed
            until after they gave consent, a <a
            href="http://www.cpsm.mb.ca/" target="_blank">College
            of Physicians and Surgeons</a> investigation has
            concluded.</p>

            <p>Dr. Matthew Howard Lazar failed to check the
            identification of a newborn baby boy before <span
            class="yellow">his trainee performed surgery</span> to
            remove the child's foreskin on Nov. 8, 2005. The baby's
            parents had not signed a consent form, and the mother
            later told the College she was still "undecided" about
            the surgery because of the pain.</p>

            <p>And even though the surgery had already been done,
            Lazar still discussed the pros and cons of circumcision
            with the baby's parents at a meeting at which the
            parents signed a consent form.</p>

            <p>After performing a circumcision on another patient,
            Lazar then carried their baby, who had earlier been
            wrongfully circumcised, into his parents' arms, telling
            them the surgery was a success.</p>

            <p>Later the same evening, after hospital
            administration found out about the mistake and ordered
            Lazar to meet with the parents and apologize, the
            doctor didn't tell the parents a trainee, and not he,
            had performed the procedure.</p>

            <p>According to a written report by the college's
            investigation committee, that final omission, which the
            parents only learned about the next day, left them
            feeling "betrayed", questioning whether they had been
            told "the whole truth of what had occurred", and
            believing the doctor's apology "was insincere".</p>

            <p>Dr. Bill Pope, the college's registrar, said Lazar's
            actions have left him with <a
            href="http://www.cpsm.mb.ca/core_functions/complaints/discipline/censures/2006/06/38189_0606090930-888"
             target="_blank">a permanent blemish on his record</a>
            and he has been ordered to pay the $4,676.30 cost of
            the investigation.</p>

            <p>"It's not a fine, but the cost of doing a censure
            process," Pope said yesterday.</p>

            <p>"It is a public discipline and it goes on the public
            record."</p>

            <p>Pope said the censure will have to be reported if
            Lazar applies to practice elsewhere.</p>

            <p>Lazar could not be reached for comment.</p>

            <p>Pope said the college's investigation only looked
            into the role of the physician in the matter and not
            into whether other hospital personnel brought the wrong
            child into the procedure room in the first place.</p>

            <p>Shortly after the incident, <a
            href="http://www.sbgh.mb.ca/">St. Boniface General
            Hospital</a> suspended circumcisions of newborn boys
            and since then it has decided not to reinstate the
            procedure.</p>

            <p>A spokeswoman for the hospital said they have taken
            steps to make sure such a mix-up doesn't happen for any
            other procedures. It involves double-checking patient
            information and ensuring that the consent be signed and
            noted on the child's chart. A spokeswoman for the <a
            href="http://www.wrha.mb.ca/" target="_blank">Winnipeg
            Regional Health Authority</a> said Health Sciences
            Centre does not perform circumcisions.</p>

            <p>Prof. Arthur Schafer, an ethics consultant in
            pediatrics at the <a href="http://www.hsc.mb.ca/"
            target="_blank">Health Sciences Centre</a>, said St.
            Boniface should be looking at whether they have proper
            safeguards in place to ensure any kind of medical
            procedure is not performed on the wrong patient and
            investigating why none of Lazar's colleagues checked
            patient ID.</p>

            <p>Schafer also said Lazar's initial refusal to take
            responsibility for his mistake illustrates the culture
            of "concealment" in medicine. With the threat of
            lawsuits and losing their insurance, Schafer said most
            doctors would have likely tried to cover up their error
            just as Lazar did.</p>

            <p>"There isn't an adequate culture of openness and
            disclosure and mostly it's generated by a fear of
            lawsuits," he said. "He did what most of his colleagues
            would have done and he got caught."</p>
