             The Forum - 12/19/2002</p>

            <p>Lawyers for Fargo's <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Hospital</a> want their
            client dropped from a circumcision trial before it
            heads to court.</p>

            <p>Wednesday, attorney <a
            href="http://www.vogellaw.com/fsl5cs/XMLAttorneyProfile.asp?guid=I1D0AB9301DD211B28BAB4D00E205CACF&amp;ind_wld_id=1286278"
             target="_blank">Jane Voglewede</a> asked East Central
            District Judge <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/Rothe-Seeger.htm"
             target="_blank">Cynthia Rothe-Seeger</a> to order the
            change.</p>

            <p>The move, if ordered, would leave <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734"
             target="_blank">Dr. Sunita Kantak</a> of MeritCare the
            sole defendant in the case.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.zbaer.com/anita.htm"
            target="_blank">Anita Flatt</a> of Hawley, Minn., is
            suing the doctor and hospital, claiming she and her
            husband, James, weren't told complete and accurate
            details about removing the foreskin from their son's
            penis.</p>

            <p>Anita Flatt signed a consent form for circumcision,
            but hospital staff didn't describe the benefits or
            risks of the procedure, the lawsuit says.</p>

            <p>The procedure provides no medical benefit, argues
            their attorney, <a
            href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a>. Rothe-Seeger set
            several deadlines for lawyers to submit written
            requests and share information.</p>

            <p>Once lawyers submit their motions, Rothe-Seeger will
            oversee a final motion hearing before ruling on several
            legal issues.</p>

            <p>Jury selection begins Feb. 3 in what Baer says is
            the nation's first trial of its kind. Baer calls
            circumcision a "barbaric" practice and claims the
            hospital's doctors should have provided more
            information before the Flatts consented to the
            procedure.</p>

            <p>Kantak circumcised their son, now 5, one day after
            he was born.</p>

            <p>If the couple had known more about the procedure,
            they would have chosen not to do it, Baer said.</p>

            <p>The hospital contends Anita Flatt was given
            information about circumcision and gave doctors her
            consent to perform the procedure.</p>

            <p>"This information educates parents about
            circumcision and allows them to make an informed choice
            that factors in their own personal beliefs and
            preferences," hospital spokeswoman Carrie Johnson said
            earlier this week.</p>

            <p>In court Wednesday, Voglewede said the hospital
            wasn't served with the lawsuit.</p>

            <p>She denied comment after the hearing, avoiding
            questions about her request to drop the hospital from
            the suit.</p>

            <p>However, Baer said he opposes dropping the hospital
            from the lawsuit.</p>

            <p>MeritCare was served with the suit, he said.</p>

            <p>In another twist, Rothe-Seeger said she may divide
            issues in the case to separate liability and damage
            claims.</p>

            <p>The judge also told Baer to submit questions he'd
            ask potential jurors if they were questioned
            individually and offer alternative ways to learn about
            their beliefs and family history.</p>
