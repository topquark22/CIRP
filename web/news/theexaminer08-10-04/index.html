            <h2>Circumcision completed, despite mom's
            opposition</h2>

            <p><small>By Cherryh Cluckey<br />
             The Examiner</small></p>

            <p>Three-year-old Ethan Azar is recovering well from
            his recent circumcision, said his father, Ray
            Jagoda.</p>

            <p>"It was quick and done under anesthesia," he
            said.</p>

            <p>A doctor performed the procedure last week despite
            opposition from the boy's mother.</p>

            <p>Camile Azar, Independence, was denied an order to
            protect a child from medical harm from the <a
            href="http://www.16thcircuit.org/"
            target="_blank">Jackson County Circuit Court</a>
            several weeks ago and was then denied a writ of
            prohibition from the <a
            href="http://www.courts.mo.gov/appellate/index.nsf/4C7529CAEA2586AD86256480004ECAEC/489D5FC426EC9BB0862568B0006E8115?OpenDocument"
             target="_blank">Court of Appeals</a>.</p>

            <p>She petitioned the <a
            href="http://www.courts.mo.gov/sup/index.nsf"
            target="_blank">Missouri Supreme Court</a> to intervene
            in July. The court was to determine whether the circuit
            court should listen to the case instead of dismissing
            it.</p>

            <p>However, Jagoda went ahead with the surgery.</p>

            <p>"It was for religious reasons and we found it was
            medically necessary," he said. "...Or Ethan would have
            had future problems if we didn't do it."</p>

            <p>Camile Azar disagreed.</p>

            <p>"That's not true," she said. "Saying it was
            medically justified is a fabrication to justify what he
            did."</p>

            <p>Jagoda would not reveal where the surgery was done
            or who performed it, conditions the doctor had
            requested.</p>

            <p>Camile Azar said she is angry for her son.</p>

            <p>"He will not be able to function normally the way
            nature intended," she said. "There were experts who
            tried to talk (to Jagoda about the negative side of
            circumcision). Two were even world experts, but he
            refused."</p>

            <p>Jagoda said he was under no legal obligation to wait
            for the circumcision.</p>

            <p>"I just had to find someone who had not been
            intimidated by Camille," he said.</p>

            <p>Jackson County Circuit Judge <a
            href="http://www.16thcircuit.org/Divisions/division.asp?div=31">
            Christine Sill-Rogers</a> gave Jagoda full custody of
            Ethan in May; Azar gets supervised visits. They had
            been sharing custody, but Azar previously had full
            custody.</p>
