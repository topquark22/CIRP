      <h3>An Ontario doctor is crusading to have circumcision
      criminalized&mdash;just like female genital mutilation</h3>
      By Alison DeLory 

      <p>If the only way to stop routine circumcision of male
      infants is to make it illegal, then Dr. Arif Bhimji is
      willing to fight to have the procedure criminalized.</p>

      <p>Dr. Bhimji is part of the Association for Genital
      Integrity, a Canadian group advocating that section 268 of
      the Criminal Code of Canada&mdash;which bans female genital
      mutilation&mdash;be amended to include a ban on circumcision. To
      not do so, says Dr. Bhimji, is sexual discrimination.</p>

      <p>"We're challenging the law so it offers equal protection
      to males and females," says Dr. Bhimji, adding he feels a
      moral and ethical obligation to protect one of the most
      vulnerable sectors of society&mdash;male infants.</p>

      <p>In Canada, under <a
      href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/36369.html"
      target="_blank">section 268</a>, doctors who perform female
      genital mutilation (FGM) are breaking the law and could face
      prison terms of up to 14 years. But Dr. Bhimji says certain
      forms of FGM, those involving "mere nicks of the clitoris,"
      are less physically and psychologically damaging than
      circumcision. "If we say these are abhorrent, why say it's OK
      for males?" asks Dr. Bhimji, who says he objects equally to
      female and male genital mutilation (a term he uses
      interchangeably with circumcision).</p>

      <p>About 30 individuals and groups make up the <a
      href="http://www.courtchallenge.com/"
      target="_blank">Association for Genital Integrity</a>. They
      share the belief that it is unethical to remove a normal body
      part from a non-consenting individual.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.cps.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian
      Pediatric Society</a> also recommends circumcision of
      newborns should not be performed, citing lack of medical
      evidence to support the procedure. Dr. Bhimji feels doctors,
      as medical practitioners, should follow the recommendation.
      But, he says, doctors take a paternalistic attitude toward
      circumcisions, and many remain ill-informed about the
      foreskin's anatomy and functionality.</p>

      <p>"When I was in med school in 1988 (Dr. Bhimji graduated
      from the <a href="http://www.usask.ca/"
      target="_blank">University of Saskatchewan</a> in 1989 and
      now practises primarily occupational medicine in Concord,
      Ont.), I was told 'Circumcision is healthy; circumcision is
      cleaner,' " says Dr. Bhimji. It wasn't until years later when
      a patient asked him about circumcision that Dr. Bhimji began
      his research. Saying he found no strong evidence to support
      circumcision, but plenty of evidence to suggest the foreskin
      is a sensual, innervated organ and that infants suffer pain
      during the procedure, he began speaking out against
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>"We have a medical obligation to do what's in the
      patient's best interest and to do no harm. The propensity for
      harm (due to complications from the surgery) is greater than
      the health benefit."</p>

      <p>The Association for Genital Integrity doesn't want a total
      ban on circumcision, and would support it in cases of
      phimosis or balanitis. But Dr. Bhimji states as a medically
      required procedure, it would only be performed in less than
      10% of male births. Estimates put the current rate of
      circumcision at about 25% of infant males in Canada.</p>

      <p>He also speaks cautiously about the role of circumcision
      in religion, cognizant that certain groups, especially Jews
      and Muslims, consider it a sacred rite. "It's not a religious
      argument. It's a medical issue," says Dr. Bhimji. "In
      Canadian society, religion has its limitations. Muslims say
      if you have a thief, chop off his hand. Do we allow that to
      continue?" asks Dr. Bhimji, himself a Muslim. "Let's deal
      with it on an evidence-based level. Is it an ethical,
      medically necessary procedure for non-consenting adults?
      No."</p>

      <p>The association applied to the <a
      href="http://www.ccppcj.ca/" target="_blank">Court Challenges
      Program</a>, a special fund that helps groups wanting to
      bring language and equality rights cases before the courts,
      for assistance. It was denied. As part of its response, in a
      letter dated March 30, the Court Challenges Program said the
      applicants "did not demonstrate that section 236 of the
      Criminal Code provides inadequate protection to male infants
      from aggravated assaults involving male genitalia."</p>

      <p>But the association is launching an appeal and if again
      unsuccessful, Dr. Bhimji says members will raise the
      necessary funds (about $47,000, he estimates) on their own.
      It has launched an aggressive letter-writing campaign (see <a
      href="http://www.courtchallenge.com/"
      target="_blank">www.courtchallenge.com</a>) targeting
      government, regulatory bodies, academic and human rights
      groups and others. The responses it has received have been
      polite but non- committal. According to Dr. Bhimji: "No one
      is willing to answer the basic question being put forward as
      to whether it is ethical to remove a body part" from an
      infant.</p>

      <p>He wishes the provincial licensing bodies would take a
      clear position on the issue, but says they refuse. He's asked
      the provincial ministries of health to force the medical
      colleges to take a leadership position on circumcision, but
      they haven't done so.</p>

      <p>Which leaves Dr. Bhimji and the association with no choice
      but to challenge the Criminal Code. "It would be ideal not to
      go to court," says Dr. Bhimji, who's nonetheless willing to
      take his battle to the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/"
      target="_blank">Supreme Court of Canada</a> if he must.</p>
