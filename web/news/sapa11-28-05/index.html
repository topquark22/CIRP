            <h2>Boy dies at circumcision school</h2>
            November 28 2005 at 01:18AM 

            <p>Mthatha - One boy has died and eight others were
            admitted to Mthatha general hospital after they fell
            ill at a circumcision school in the area, the Eastern
            Cape health department said on Monday.</p>

            <p>"When we got there on Sunday night one of the boys
            had already died. Two are in a critical condition and
            the others are stable," spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said.
            They are aged between 18 and 20.</p>

            <p>Health department officials went to investigate the
            school at Link village outside Mthatha after being
            informed by community members of possible problems.</p>
            " 

            <p>It's a legal school. The man in charge is
            registered, but failed to report on time that the boys
            were sick. There is a possibility that he will be
            charged with negligence," Kupelo said. Police have
            opened an inquest docket.</p>

            <p>'There is a possibility that he will be charged with
            negligence' It was the first death since the start of
            the circumcision season two weeks ago.</p>

            <p>In a separate incident, police and health officials
            would on Monday continue their search for a group of 19
            boys believed to be part of an illegal initiation
            school hiding in the bush near Flagstaff.</p>

            <p>"Police and community members spent the whole day on
            Saturday searching for the boys. They started the
            search at 10am using a helicopter. It was called off at
            3.45pm due to bad weather. One of the boys is reported
            to be in ill health."</p>

            <p>Kupelo said that since Friday last week six people
            had been arrested in different parts of the province
            for "unlawful circumcisions".</p>

            <p>The department appealed to community members to take
            responsibility for the schools in their area and to
            report problems.</p>

            <p>"We want it to be a communal thing. During the
            June/July season 23 boys died in the bush." About half
            those deaths were in the Libode area, east of
            Mthatha.</p>

            <p>Of the 23 who had died, 15 succumbed to illnesses
            such as meningitis and pneumonia. At least five boys
            had their genitals amputated following botched
            circumcisions.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said boys going to circumcision schools
            needed to be sent for medical check-ups to make sure
            they were in good health before undergoing the
            ritual.</p>

            <p>"They are exposed to bad weather conditions and to
            dehydration. According to the traditional way the boys
            are denied water for the first eight days. If they are
            not healthy enough there is definitely a risk."</p>

            <p>Those in the province requiring assistance or
            wanting to report illegal schools could call the
            circumcision health line on 08000-323-64.</p>
