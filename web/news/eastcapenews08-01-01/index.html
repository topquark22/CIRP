      <p>Five out of about 25 Xhosa initiates admitted to East
      London's Cecilia Makiwane hospital with circumcision injuries
      last month died in hospital, according to a young specialist
      doctor.</p>

      <p>The doctor, whose identity is being withheld to protect
      her, said at least ten percent of initiates admitted returned
      home without a penis or just a stump to urinate with and had
      little chance of leading a normal sex life.</p>

      <p>However, the doctor said because they still had
      testosterone- producing testicles and still experienced a sex
      drive, they experienced severe psychological stress when
      rejoining their community.</p>

      <p>More than half of those who recovered, would experience
      difficulty in regaining their sexuality as a result of their
      injuries.</p>

      <p>The initiates often arrived at the hospital in an
      emaciated and dehydrated condition.</p>

      <p>"They come in with a low blood count, or their kidneys
      have given in, they have cerebral oedema, or are very thin,
      or have a low protein count."</p>

      <p>"Some recover quickly, some just die with very little
      sepsis. It seems their organs just pack in."</p>

      <p>"It is very scary to see fit young men come in emaciated,
      sick, with their skin falling off, sick, sick, sick."</p>

      <p>A senior nurse, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
      communities responded negatively to young men who were
      mutilated by botched circumcisions.</p>

      <p>"They are ostracised and called names, especially by their
      peer group."</p>

      <p>"Many have breakdowns."</p>

      <p>The doctor, who did not want to criticize the custom,
      said: "It can be done properly. Circumcisions have happened
      in the past without being botched, so there must be a
      way."</p>
