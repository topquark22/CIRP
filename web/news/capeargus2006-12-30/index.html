            'Mysterious' Initiation Death</h2>

            <p>Myolisi Gophe<br />
             Cape Town</p>

            <p>Instead of celebrating as their son's successful
            matric marks were published this week, a Gugulethu
            family was mourning him after he died during an
            initiation ceremony.</p>

            <p>Lunga Nocanda, 18, who matriculated from <a
            href="http://www.hermanushigh.org/"
            target="_blank">Hermanus High School</a>, died "under
            mysterious circumstances" at an initiation school in
            Paarl on December 18 - the only known casualty of a
            botched circumcision ritual in the Western Cape this
            season.</p>

            <p>Another initiate was admitted to the <a
            href="http://www.capegateway.gov.za/eng/directories/facilities/6444/20378"
             target="_blank">GF Jooste Hospital</a> with a septic
            wound, but was treated and discharged the following
            day, according to a sister at the hospital.</p>

            <p>After years of problems, the number of botched
            initiations throughout South Africa dropped
            dramatically this year, including in Cape Town.</p>

            <p>Last year one person died in Cape Town and 10 more
            were admitted to hospitals.</p>

            <p>Cultural groups believe the decrease can be
            attributed to awareness campaigns by themselves and the
            Department of Sport and Cultural Affairs.</p>

            <p>Public hearings have been held around the Metro to
            seek solutions to the problem and the government is in
            the process of setting up an Initiation Unit, so the
            rituals can be better controlled.</p>

            <p>Mandla Yeki, spokesman for the Department of Sport
            and Cultural Affairs, said lack of training, poor
            discipline, drug and alcohol abuse by traditional
            nurses had been raised at the hearings and the new unit
            would look into ways of providing proper training.</p>

            <p>He hoped the unit would be established before the
            winter initiation season, which begins in May.</p>

            <p>But it comes too late to save Lunga, who was
            planning to study business management at the <a
            href="http://www.cput.ac.za/" target="_blank">Cape
            Peninsula University of Technology</a>.</p>

            <p>His cousin Thandi Nocanda said the family was upset
            because they did not believe the initiation school was
            telling them the truth.</p>

            <p>"They said he had stomach pains and a headache but
            the post-mortem results show he died of dehydration,
            hunger and had been beaten," she said.</p>

            <p>Police are investigating.</p>
