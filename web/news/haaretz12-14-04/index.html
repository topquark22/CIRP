            <h2>Rabbi ordered to pay NIS 1.18 million for botched
            circumcision</h2>

            <p>By Yuval Azoulay, Haaretz Correspondent</p>

            <p>The Rishon Letzion Magistrate's Court on Tuesday
            ordered the former rabbi of the Gan Yavneh local
            council to pay a child and his parents NIS 1.18 million
            in damages after the child was left severely disfigured
            when he was circumcised by the rabbi.</p>

            <p>The rabbi, Mehumar Tzubari, performed the religious
            ceremony on the child in April 1995. A few hours after
            the ceremony, the mother realized that the tip of the
            child's penis was blacked and called the rabbi. He
            checked the area, applied iodine ointment and told the
            mother not to worry and that "everything will be
            fine."</p>

            <p>After several days in the hospital, doctors
            diagnosed gangrene in the penis tip. The penis tip was
            lost, the penis became trapped within the skin
            enveloping it. Two years later, the infant underwent
            surgery at Schneider Children's Hospital to release the
            penis, replace the missing skin and give the penis a
            healthier appearance. The operation failed.</p>

            <p>In August 2000, the infant was operated on in the
            United States by Dr. Gerald Jordan, a world renowned
            expert on reconstructive surgery. According to the
            child's parents, the operation failed to restore the
            penis to normal since the reconstructed tip does not
            enable an erection to be maintained during
            intercourse.</p>

            <p>The parents filed suit against the rabbi, the Gan
            Yavneh religious council, the Gan Yavneh local council
            and the Religious Affairs Ministry. The deputy
            president of the Rishon Letzion Magistrate's Court,
            Judge Dalia Gannot, rejected the suits against the
            public bodies, but found in favor of the suit against
            the rabbi.</p>

            <p>During the trial, it emerged that Tzubari was not
            qualified to work as a mohel (the religious official
            who carries out a circumcision).</p>

            <p>The judge ordered Tzubari to pay NIS 850,000 of the
            NIS 1.18 million in damages for the family's past and
            future suffering, and to compensate the parents for the
            cost of psychiatric treatment for their son.</p>
