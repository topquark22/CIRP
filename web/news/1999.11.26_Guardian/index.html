              <h2>Muslim father loses court battle</h2>
            </center>

            <p>A Muslim father yesterday lost his legal battle to
            have his son, five, ritually circumcised against his
            mother's wishes.</p>

            <p>The court of appeal <a
            href="/library/legal/Re_J/2000.html">ruled</a> that,
            although under islamic law the boy was born a Muslim,
            "a newborn child does not share the conceptions of the
            parents", and the appeal was dismissed.</p>

            <p>The father, 27, a Muslim of Turkish origin and the
            English mother have been battling over the child's
            future since 1996. Both live in the Manchester
            area.</p>

            <p>Lindsey Kushner QC, for the father, had told the
            court that as a Muslim the father had a duty to ensure
            his son was circumcised.</p>

            <p>Lord Justice Thorpe said the boy lived in his
            mother's household, and his only real contact with
            Islam was when he visited his father, who did not
            attend mosque or mix in Muslim circles.</p>

            <p>The judge said it was not in the best interests of
            the child to be circumcised, with its risk of pain and
            psychological damage which the boy would find hard to
            understand.</p>

            <p>He said the boy might be traumatised by the
            operation. "The operation and the period leading up to
            it was also likely to be highly stressful to the
            mother."</p>

            <p>The father had appealed against a high court ruling
            in April, the first time a court had decided wether a
            child should be circumcised when on parent was opposed
            to it.</p>

            <p>Mr Justice Wall who turned down the father's
            application, said the mother, 29, met the father in on
            holiday in Turkey in 1992 and married him a few months
            later.</p>

            <p>Lord Justice Thorpe said the father claimed that the
            mother had given assurances that any male child would
            be circumcised. But he said a court should not agree to
            the operation when one parent disagreed, unless the
            boy's welfare would benefit.</p>

              <h2>Ruling stops boy, 5, being circumcised</h2>
            </center>

            <p>A high court judge <a
            href="/library/legal/Re_J/">ruled</a> yesterday that a
            boy aged five should not be circumcised against his
            mother's wishes.</p>

            <p>Mr Justice Wall said in London that the welfare of
            the child, identified only as J, was the paramount
            consideration. when parents disagreed over the
            procedure.</p>

            <p>Rejecting an application by the child's father for
            the operation to go ahead, he said ritual circumcision,
            for religious or social reasons, was lawful. Only when
            the parents disagreed was it for the court to decide
            the matter. He said the father, 27, who is of Turkish
            origin, was not a practising Muslim, and the mother,
            29, the primary carer, was a non- practising Christian.
            They separated in 1986 and were divorced, with the
            father granted reasonable contact.</p>

            <p>The judge said it was plain the mother had neither
            knowledge of Islam nor any interest in acquiring it.
            J's only real contact with Islam would be through his
            father, who lives in England and does not mix in Muslim
            circles.</p>

            <p>He ruled that, as there was no medical indication
            that J required circumcision, on balance it was not in
            his interests to be circumcised against his mother's
            wishes. In his judgment, the disadvantages of this
            effectively irreversible surgical intervention. In J's
            case outweighed the benefits.</p>

            <p>He made an order preventing the father arranging for
            the child to be circumcised without the permission of
            the high court. He granted the father leave to
            appeal.</p>
