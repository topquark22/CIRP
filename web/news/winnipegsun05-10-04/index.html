            <h2>Sad end to boy/girl life</h2>

            <h3>Subject of gender experiment</h3>

            <p>By KATIE CHALMERS, STAFF REPORTER</p>

            <p>A Winnipeg man who was born a boy but raised as a
            girl in a famous nurture-versus-nature experiment has
            died at the age of 38. David Reimer, who shared his
            story in the pages of a book and on the TV show Oprah,
            took his own life last Tuesday.</p>

            <p>His mother, Janet Reimer, said she believes her son
            would still be here today had it not been for the
            devastating gender study that led to much emotional
            hardship.</p>

            <p>"He managed to have so much courage," Janet told
            <i>The Sun</i> yesterday. "I think he felt he had no
            options. It just kept building up and building up."</p>

            <p>After a botched circumcision as a toddler, David
            became the subject of an experiment dubbed the
            John/Joan case in the '60s and '70s.</p>

            <p>Janet said she still harbours anger toward a
            Baltimore doctor who convinced her and her husband,
            Ron, to give female hormones to their son and raise him
            as a daughter, Brenda. Kids were cruel to Brenda
            growing up in Winnipeg.</p>

            <p>"They wouldn't let him use the boys' washroom or the
            girls. He had to go in the back alley," Janet
            recalled.</p>

            <p>MATCHED CONTROL SUBJECT</p>

            <p>This gender transformation was widely reported as a
            success and proof that children are not by nature
            feminine or masculine but through nurture are
            socialized to become girls or boys. David's identical
            twin brother, Brian, offered researchers a matched
            control subject.</p>

            <p>But when David discovered the truth about his past
            during his teenage years, he rebelled and resumed his
            male identity, eventually marrying and becoming a
            stepfather to three children.</p>

            <p>In 2000, author John Colapinto wrote <i>As Nature
            Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl</i>,
            providing David an opportunity to tell the real story.
            It was difficult but David wanted to save other
            children from a similar fate, his mother said.</p>

            <p>MEDIA SWIRL</p>

            <p>While he had spoken anonymously in the past, David
            was launched into a media swirl after Colapinto's book
            was published, starting with an appearance on Oprah in
            February 2000.</p>

            <p>"I thought the Reimers were just the most dignified,
            fantastic people on that program," Colapinto told
            <i>The Sun</i> at the time.</p>

            <p>"I think in a way these wonderful working-class
            people from Winnipeg just kind of stepped onto the
            world stage on Oprah and were a lesson to us all in
            dignity and survival and openness and courage."</p>

            <p>David recently slumped into a depression after
            losing his job and separating from his wife.</p>

            <p>He was also still grieving the death of his twin
            brother two years earlier, their mother said. A cause
            of death was never confirmed but Janet suspects it
            might have been an overdose of medication which Brian
            required to treat schizophrenia.</p>

            <p>Daily, David would visit his brother's grave,
            placing fresh flowers and pulling weeds to keep it
            tidy.</p>

            <p>Just last week, David told his parents that things
            would get better soon but they never imagined he was
            planning to commit suicide.</p>

            <p>Janet said she'll remember her son as "the most
            generous, loving soul that ever lived."</p>

            <p>"He liked music. He liked jokes. He was a very funny
            guy," said Janet, who spent Mother's Day grieving the
            loss of her son. "He was so generous. He gave all he
            had."</p>

            <p>The funeral is today at 2 p.m. at Klassen Funeral
            Chapel.</p>
