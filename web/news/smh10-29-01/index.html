      <p class="byline"><b>By Julie Robotham, Medical
      Writer</b></p>

      <p>Thanks to Frederick Ehrlich, some 3,000 foreskins are no
      more.</p>

      <p>That is the number of circumcisions the prolific Professor
      Ehrlich estimates he has performed - mostly as a surgeon, but
      several hundred in his capacity as mohel, a Jewish ritual
      circumciser.</p>

      <p>With his eyesight failing, Professor Ehrlich is no longer
      routinely removing the loose skin covering from the tip of
      the penis of infant boys. But he has performed the operation
      on his own family, including grandsons Eitan, who had the
      operation last year, and Noah.</p>

      <p>Professor Ehrlich, with colleagues around the world, is
      preparing to defend the procedure that has become a <a
      href="/library/legal/smith/">children's rights</a>
      battleground - hotly contested between cultural leaders,
      doctors and the men's movement.</p>

      <p>Australia's peak pediatricians' body is reviewing its <a
      href="/library/statements/acp1996/">circumcision policy</a>,
      while internationally the trend against circumcision
      continues to gain ground. <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/news/sapa10-01-01/">Sweden recently
      became the first country to outlaw it</a>, to the fury of
      Jewish and Muslim groups.</p>

      <p>"The reason why pediatric surgeons tend to be
      anti-circumcision and [doctors who treat adults] are for it
      is that the benefit to the infant is not apparent," Professor
      Ehrlich said.</p>

      <p>But circumcision in infancy could protect adults from
      health problems, said a United States-based urologist, Dr
      Samuel Kunin, who joined Professor Ehrlich last night in East
      Sydney for a debate convened by the Australian Jewish Medical
      Foundation.</p>

      <p>Uncircumcised men with diabetes "have problems with
      chronic infection and <a href="/library/sex_function/">sexual
      dysfunction</a>", Dr Kunin said.</p>

      <p>In addition, several studies had concluded circumcised men
      were at lower risk of <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/">urinary tract
      infections</a>, <a
      href="/library/disease/HIV/vanhowe4/">HIV/AIDS</a> and <a
      href="/library/disease/cancer/">cancer of the penis</a>.</p>

      <p>About one in 10 Australian male infants is now
      circumcised, down from more than half in the 1960s. Medicare
      paid for 15,415 infant circumcisions last year, and 2,798 on
      boys up to 10 - usually due to medical problems.</p>

      <p>But George Williams, a pediatrician at the <a
      href="http://www.nch.edu.au/">Children's Hospital at
      Westmead</a>, said circumcision carried too great a risk of
      complications for it to be justified for healthy infants.</p>

      <p>"In Australia we have a death every five years from
      circumcision. Bleeding affects one in 300, infections one in
      300," said Dr Williams, who spoke on the other side of the
      debate.</p>

      <p>Botched operations could lead to further complications.
      Scarring could occur, and the penis could not grow properly
      if too much skin was removed, causing painful bending. "A
      child has a right to his own body. This is an elective
      mutilating procedure."</p>

      <p>The president of the pediatrics and child health division
      of the <a href="http://www.racp.edu.au/">Royal Australasian
      College of Physicians</a>, Dr Jill Sewell, said it was
      unlikely the group's revised policy would come out clearly
      for or against circumcision when it is finalised early next
      year.</p>

      <p>"On the whole it's not a necessary procedure even though
      there's some evidence it may protect against things later in
      life," she said. "It's an area where unless the evidence is
      very clear we haven't got the right to say anything
      definitive."</p>

      <p>Although anti-circumcision groups argued it was the
      child's right to remain intact, Dr Sewell said it could be
      argued there was a "right of the child to be the same as
      other children in that culture. If you drive these things
      underground you often increase the medical risks associated
      with them."</p>
