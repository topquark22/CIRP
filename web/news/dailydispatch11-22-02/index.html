            <p><b>By Madoda Dyonana</b></p>

            <p>UMTATA -- <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/structure/profile/goqwana.htm"
             target="_blank">Health MEC Bevan Goqwana</a> yesterday
            asked for charges to be brought against a local
            traditional surgeon after the death of two minors,
            following botched circumcisions at Waterfalls village
            near here.</p>

            <p>Goqwana said the suspect allegedly circumcised Zola
            Mjamba,16, and Sifiso Kobo, 17. Zola died on Tuesday
            and Sifiso on Thursday. Their deaths were allegedly as
            a result of complications arising from the ritual.</p>

            <p>Goqwana alleged the traditional surgeon acted
            without parental consent and failed to comply with
            departmental policy.</p>

            <p>"We're angered by the news and will work very hard
            to ensure that the perpetrator is brought to book and
            would also like to send a strong message that the
            department will not tolerate such behaviour," said
            Goqwana.</p>

            <p>He urged people to respect the tradition and comply
            with the departmental policy to avoid any further loss
            of life.</p>

            <p>Police spokesperson Superintendent Nondumiso Jafta
            could only confirm Mjamba's death, saying the police
            were still investigating. No arrest has been made.</p>

            <p>Provincial House of Traditional Leaders member
            Prince Xhanti Sigcawu expressed shock at the deaths,
            saying his organisation was against people disregarding
            the law.</p>

            <p>He called on the authorities to arrest the
            perpetrator and ensure the rule of law.</p>

            <p>"I also call upon our traditional leaders to focus
            their energies on the circumcision period and sensitise
            people on the importance of preserving the
            culture."</p>
