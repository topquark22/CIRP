            <h4>Doctors re-examine issues surrounding painful
            procedure</h4>

            <p>Sandra McCulloch<br />
             Times Colonist</p>

            <p>Friday, February 20, 2004</p>

            <p>It was once considered a minor operation that caused
            male infants no pain and reduced health risks.</p>

            <p>"I did circumcisions as an intern -- the kid
            screamed for a bit, you put a soother in his mouth and
            that was it," said Dr. Peter Seland, a urologist and
            deputy-registrar with the <a
            href="http://www.cpsbc.bc.ca/" target="_blank">B.C.
            College of Physicians and Surgeons</a>.</p>

            <p>That was 40 years ago and a time when infant males
            were routinely circumcised.</p>

            <p>Circumcision is the surgical removal of the sleeve
            of skin and tissue that normally covers the head of the
            penis.</p>

            <p>A generation ago, anesthesia wasn't used and parents
            were assured that infants couldn't feel pain.</p>

            <p>Now Seland says he feels terrible -- because we now
            know that circumcision causes pain in the short- and
            long-term.</p>

            <p>"It didn't cross your mind you were causing
            long-term harm," Seland said a in telephone interview
            from Vancouver on Wednesday.</p>

            <p>He has recently chaired an ethics committee that
            examined issues surrounding circumcision for the
            college.</p>

            <p>The issue came to the forefront recently with the
            release of a coroner's report on the <a
            href="/news/theprovince08-29-02/">death</a> of a Vernon
            infant circumcised at <a
            href="http://www.penticton.ca/eds/hospital/page1.html"
            target="_blank">Penticton General Hospital</a> in
            August 2002.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Coroner Chico Newell urged
            hospitals to inform parents that any amount of bleeding
            is bad -- an infant can die from losing just one ounce
            of blood.</span></p>

            <p>Newell said the parents of one-month-old Ryhliegh
            McWillis weren't properly informed about danger signals
            to watch for in post-operative care.</p>

            <p>The province doesn't keep track of the number of
            circumcisions done each year. But the <a
            href="http://www.cvihr.bc.ca/"
            target="_blank">Vancouver Island Health Region</a> says
            the procedure is becoming rarer at <a
            href="http://vvv.com/home/bmwong/vepa/vgh.htm">Victoria
            General Hospital</a>.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">This past year, only 15 of
            1,414 male infants born at VGH were circumcised, or
            about one per cent.</span> That's less than a third of
            the number done four years ago -- 47.</p>

            <p>Circumcision is now uncommon except in Jewish or
            Muslim communities, said Seland.</p>

            <p>"It varies significantly in regions. (Circumcisions)
            are more common in the Interior."</p>

            <p>A draft of the ethics' committee report will be
            before the college next month, he said. The report
            examines the history of male circumcision and its role
            in cultural and ethnic circles. It outlines the
            proposed medical benefits and evidence of risks.</p>

            <p>"What we're attempting to do with this document is
            have physicians and parents weigh the medical and
            ethical issues that are there and find their own
            balance and make their own choices," Seland said.</p>

            <p>However, we now know circumcision is far from
            painless for the infant. The evidence is now
            "overwhelming" that circumcision is extremely painful,
            said Seland.</p>

            <p>"When I was doing circumcisions in 1964, I shrugged
            off the issue of pain," he said.</p>

            <p>At that time, half of all infant boys were
            circumcised. The mindset of parents then was "like
            daddy, like son."</p>

            <p>After examining the so-called benefits and risks of
            circumcision, Seland said the bottom line is that
            circumcision doesn't particularly help or harm an
            infant.</p>

            <p>"Having looked at the pros and cons, it appears to
            be more or less at an even balance."</p>

            <p>The emotional issues surrounding circumcision are
            far more complex, Seland said.</p>

            <p>"It's a very polarized area within the community,"
            he said.</p>

            <p>The decline of popularity of the procedure is due to
            doctors presenting parents with the real risks and
            limited benefits, he said.</p>

            <p>Seland said the pain issue "is a very important
            aspect."</p>
