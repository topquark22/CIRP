            <h4><i>A procedure once done as a matter of course has
            suddenly become your first major parenting
            decision</i></h4>
            <img src="par_mobile.jpg" width="250" height="295"

            <p>I have two older brothers. They were married within
            a year of each another and, a few years later, prepared
            for the arrivals of their first children together.
            Ultrasound photos revealed tiny penises that through
            two trimesters brought the family nothing but joy. But
            then it came time for the little decisions expectant
            parents need to make, such as whether to cut off the
            skin at the end of the penis. One brother thought
n            nothing of this decision. <i>Of course</i> he would
            circumcise. He was an American, wasn't he? The other
            brother, though, did some research and decided that,
            despite the fact that circumcision had been the
            accepted practice in our gentile family for at least
            four generations, it was wrong -- our penises had been
            cruelly mutilated, and it wasn't going to happen to his
            son. Suffice it to say, there was somewhat less joy
            after that.</p>

            <table width="160" align="left" summary="hygiene">
              <tr>
                <td class="s">
                  <br />

                  <h4 class="side">Under the Hood</h4>

                  <p class="sidebar">Chances are that if you're
                  reading this, you're circumcised. Chances are
                  also roughly 50-50 that your son will be
                  uncircumcised if current trends hold. And if
                  you're circumcised, chances are you have no idea
                  how to care for an uncircumcised penis. Don't
                  fret. Care for your intact infant son is, in
                  fact, quite simple and goes something like this:
                  Feed him, clothe him, and sit back and let him
                  dangle in peace. Unlike a newly circumcised
                  penis, which requires all the dressings and
                  ointments of any wound, the intact member
                  requires nothing more than a bath every couple of
                  days. For a number of years the foreskin and the
                  head actually remain fused together, so don't jab
                  Q-tips or other foreign objects under the hood,
                  and, just as important, do not pull back the
                  foreskin; it will become retractable on its own,
                  usually by age five (but sometimes not until
                  after puberty). When this happens, you should
                  show -- or, if you're squeamish, tell -- your son
                  how to clean himself. The foreskin should be
                  pulled back and the skin folds and penis head
                  washed with soap and water. And if your son asks
                  why his looks different from yours, tell him that
                  back when you were a defenseless newborn, doctors
                  hacked off part of your penis. That should shut
                  him up.<br />

            <p>My family reflected a growing national debate. A
            practice that until recently was a nearly universal
            custom in this country, as pervasive as driving on the
            right side of the road, has become much more of an open
            question. Although the surgery is still a standard part
            of the hospital delivery process, 12 states have
            officially designated circumcision an elective
            procedure and eliminated Medicaid funding for it. In
            California and Maine, some private insurers followed
            Medicaid's lead, resulting in out-of-pocket costs of
            $100 to $500 that have led many parents to instruct
            doctors to skip the procedure altogether. And in a
            lawsuit that legal experts say could be a sign of
            things to come, a 19-year-old boy has settled with a
            New York hospital, claiming the staff never should have
            gone to his mother while she was still groggy from the
            anesthetic and asked her to consent to having a normal
            part of his body lopped off. In my self-appointed role
            as family referee, I clicked on some anticircumcision
            websites.</p>

            <p>I quickly learned that a <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/taylor/">quarter
            to a half of my penis's skin</a> was removed shortly
            after birth, probably with very little or no
            anesthetic, and that some people liken this to having
            your lips or eyelids removed and then having to walk
            around with your gums or eyeballs exposed to the
            elements. Without the natural covering of the intact
            foreskin, nerves die and the glans, or head of the
            penis, gradually becomes calloused from all that
            chafing by coarse underwear. And that's counting only
            the nerves that are left: "40,000 nerve endings," by
            one website's count, follow the discarded prepuce into
            the trash.</p>

            <p>It was this last part, about a missing pleasure
            center, that finally caused me to put in a call to
            Marilyn Milos, director of the National Organization of
            Circumcision Information Resource Centers. (Get it? <a
            href="http://www.nocirc.org/">NOCIRC</a>.) Shortly into
            our conversation, she asked me to tickle the back of my
            hand. Okay. "Now turn your hand over and do the same to
            your palm. Feel the difference?" she asked excitedly,
            as the tingling shot up my arm. "Those are the
            Meissner's corpuscles at work. Nowhere are they more
            concentrated than in the ring at the opening of the
            foreskin that rolls back during an erection."</p>

            <p>I thought for a moment about all that sensation
            formerly packed into my penis and now . . . gone.
            "Shit."</p>

            <p>"Yeah, I know," she said.</p>

            <p>While the U.S. is the only industrialized country
            that performs routine circumcision, the surgery goes
            back thousands of years. Egyptians likely did it for
            hygienic purposes: Removing the folds of foreskin
            prevented sand from getting in and causing irritation.
            Jews did it, and still do, because Abraham said that
            God said so. And 19th-century Americans started doing
            it because doctors said it would prevent masturbation.
            In 1888, when about 15 percent of the U.S. population
            was circumcised, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, the cereal
            tycoon, wrote, "The operation should be performed by a
            surgeon without administering an anesthetic, as the
            pain attending the operation will have a salutary
            effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected
            with the idea of punishment." As prevalent a "problem"
            as masturbation was, however, circumcision didn't
            become widespread until after World War II, when more
            people were born in hospitals and the health-care
            system began searching for new sources of revenue.
            Freudian theories (which have largely fallen out of
            favor) about the importance of little boys sharing the
            same penis identifications as their fathers deepened
            the movement's hold throughout the sixties and
            seventies. By 1980, the circumcision rate in this
            country reached a peak of 85 percent. Ten years later,
            though, it had tailed off to 61 percent, and by <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statistics/bollinger2003/">
            2001 is estimated to have been at 55 percent</a>-- just
            five points above what groups like NOCIRC predict could
            be the circumcision tipping point.</p>

            <p>It's important to note, of course, that there are
            plenty of experts who insist there is a negligible
            difference in sensation between a circumcised and an
            uncircumcised penis. In fact, most of the debate goes
            this way, with one side saying something so completely
            opposite from the other that one wonders why there
            isn't hard scientific evidence to close the case. For
            instance, intactivists, as the anticircumcisers like to
            be called, make the claim that smegma, the goo produced
            by the inner mucosal membrane of an uncircumcised
            penis, performs a <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/STD/fleiss3/">
            natural immunological function</a>. The pro-circs, as
            they're known, come back with findings that smegma is
            not only not beneficial but is actually carcinogenic.
            One thing everyone agrees on is that smegma is a scary
            word and that the substance, if not cleaned out daily,
            stinks and will no doubt deter oral sex. Similar rifts
            swirl around urinary-tract infections and sexually
            transmitted diseases.</p>

            <p>There are other disputes, some more clear-cut than
            others. In the case of circumcision and pain, all
            doctors now agree that some type of anesthetic should
            be used and that infant pain, just a decade ago
            believed to be nonexistent or highly muted, is actually
            as vivid, or more so, than that of adults. (If going
            with the surgery, parents should ask for two shots each
            of ventral and dorsal Lidocaine to be administered at
            the base of the penis.) Then there are the medical
            risks inherent in any such routine surgery. Dr. George
            Denniston, president of <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>, says
            that more often than you'd like to believe, doctors
            clip off too much and that the result is a "buried
            penis," a penis head that just makes it out of the
            pelvic fat. Instances of actual botched surgeries are
            rare, however, and the calibrated clamps that doctors
            use make it difficult to overclip to a grotesque
            degree.</p>

            <p>Finally, there are the larger social issues of
            female preference and -- "What the hell is that?!"--
            teasing. Poll after poll has shown that most American
            women prefer the streamlined penis. It looks better,
            they say. But it's also true that most of them were
            born before the big eighties numerical drop-off that
            has already made elementary and junior high school
            locker rooms much more foreskin-friendly. And as more
            people get used to seeing uncircumcised penises, women
            may find they like the turtlenecked, naturally lubed
            model <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/ohara/">even
            better</a>.</p>

            <p>"Circumcision is not essential to a child's
            well-being at birth, even though it does have
            [potential] medical benefits," concluded a recent <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/">statement</a>
            from the American Academy of Pediatrics, which has the
            feel of a bottom line on the subject. "These benefits
            are not compelling enough to warrant the AAP to
            recommend routine newborn circumcision." All the
            medical and social reasons for whether or not to
            perform a circumcision, in other words, are essentially
            a wash. And, increasingly, doctors are shifting the
            responsibility for weighing the pros and cons squarely
            onto parents.</p>

            <p>After the births of their two sons, my brothers
            buried the hatchet. Pictures of larvae and jokes about
            creative uses of leftover foreskin accompanied
            congratulatory remarks, and within months the two
            babies were sharing baths and yanking on each other's
            weenies like any loving cousins. Still, at one point I
            had to ask my pro-circ brother how, after being exposed
            to everything my intactivist brother fed him during
            their argument, he could circumcise his own son.
            "Look," he wrote me, "I was circumcised, and it was
            perfectly fine for me. Besides, we all remember the
            poor kid in high school who was uncircumcised. I didn't
            want my son to have another thing to worry about, even
            if only for the few years before the uncircumcised kids
            take over." I sent an e-mail out to both brothers
            declaring that, with a 50-50 world out there, both boys
            will be just fine. The brothers agreed. I signed off
            and took a moment to tickle my palms and pray that when
            my time comes, I'll have a baby girl.</p>
