$35,000</font></h2>

<hr size="1" color="black">
<p>A judge awarded $35,000 Monday to a woman who claimed her former
husband conspired 29 years ago to circumcise her without her
consent.</p>

<p>In the same ruling, Judge Pro Tempore John Perry Jr. assessed
the woman, Mary Ann Turner, the costs of a 1996 mistrial in the
case. Perry didn't say how much that would be.</p>

<p>He also said the inadmissibility of a piece of evidence forced
him to conclude Turner didn't have knowledge of the surgical
procedure.</p>

<p>Turner sued her former husband, local anesthesiologist Dr. Alan
Ostrowe, claiming he conspired with the late Dr. Anthony Leggio to
remove the skin covering her clitoris during other routine surgery
at <a href="http://www.womans.com/">Woman's Hospital</a> in
1972.</p>

<p>She said she didn't find out about the procedure until 1988,
when another physician who was at the operation told her about
it.</p>

<p>Ostrowe contended his wife agreed to the operation as a possible
way to overcome problems she was having with intercourse.</p>

<p>He claimed she filed suit only after he threatened to cut off
alimony payments.</p>

<p>In 1996, the case went to trial before a jury.</p>

<p>A judge halted the trial after Turner testified that a doctor
who assisted in the surgery told her that Ostrowe kept her knocked
out following the procedure because Ostrowe "had places to go,
people to be with" and didn't want her to know.</p>

<p>State District Judge Bob Downing said the testimony bordered on
revealing accusations of adultery that both sides had ruled off
limits before the trial began. Downing declared a mistrial, saying
he wasn't going to have "a National Enquirer trial."</p>

<p>The case was tried again this year solely before a judge.</p>

<p>In his ruling, Perry said the case boiled down to one issue --
whether Ostrowe participated in a scheme to have an unauthorized
surgical procedure performed on his wife without her consent, or
whether Turner was a knowing and willing participant.</p>

<p>Perry said he found it "difficult to imagine someone in her
situation, immediately following the birth of her third child, in
her early 30s, would have ever consented to such a bizarre
procedure."</p>

<p>He also said a doctor's handwritten notes of a telephone
conversation with another doctor who treated Turner indicate she
didn't learn about the procedure for the first time in 1988.</p>

<p>However, those notes are inadmissible because of hearsay rules,
Perry said. Hearsay is evidence that is based on what another
person has told a witness.</p>

<p>Witnesses testified that Turner "was stunned and extremely upset
when she allegedly learned for the first time in 1988 what
occurred," Perry wrote.</p>

<p>Experts testified that Turner's hospital record showed she was
given high doses of medication, Perry said. They also testified
that the consent form was suspect, he said in his ruling.</p>

<p>The ruling concludes by saying some people might feel a higher
award is justifiable under the circumstances. But he added that he
is concerned about the implications of the couple's divorce and
Turner's motives in the case.</p>

<p>"It is time to conclude this matter and allow these parties to
reconstruct their lives in a productive way without being burdened
further with this litigation," he said.</p>

<p>Attorneys for Turner and Ostrowe couldn't be reached for comment
late Monday.</p>
