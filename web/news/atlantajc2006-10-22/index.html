            <p>A father stands accused of the unthinkable: brutally
            cutting his daughter's genitals.</p>

            <p>The girl was only 2.</p>

            <p>Monday, activists from all over the world will be
            focused on a <a
            href="http://www.co.gwinnett.ga.us/cgi-bin/gwincty/egov/ep/home.do"
             target="_blank">Gwinnett County</a> <a
            href="http://www.gwinnettcourts.com/courts/supcourt.htm"
             target="_blank">courtroom</a> as Khalid Adem, accused
            of cruelty to a child and aggravated battery for
            allegedly circumcising his daughter, goes on trial.</p>

            <table align="left" width="192" summary="photo">
              <tr>
                <td><img src="atlantajc2006-10-22.jpg" width="170"
                height="232" alt="Khalid Adem" /><br />
                 Khalid Adem is accused of circumcising his
                2-year-old daughter with scissors</td>

                <td width="20">&nbsp;</td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Adem, 30, was <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/ajc03-02-04/"
            target="_blank">charged</a> with aggravated battery and
            cruelty to children more than three years ago and, if
            convicted, could face 40 years in prison. He was born
            in Ethiopia, where circumcision is a common procedure
            for young girls.</p>

            <p>Adem's trial may be a landmark case for health and
            human rights activists fighting against the African
            custom they call genital mutilation. But for those
            close to the victim, this trial is about vindication
            and healing for a little girl who was forced to endure
            unbearable pain.</p>

            <p>"When I saw that child I saw myself. I could see the
            pain in her eyes," said Soraya Mire, a filmmaker and
            activist who was circumcised when she was 13 in
            Somalia. Mire is known for her 1994 documentary "<a
            href="http://librarymedia.org/health/Titles/fireeyes.htm"
             target="_blank">Fire Eyes</a>" in which she chronicled
            her struggles after having the procedure.</p>

            <p>Mire, who now lives in Los Angeles, was asked by
            Gwinnett authorities to counsel the victim in 2003 when
            it was discovered that she had been circumcised.</p>

            <p>"She hugged me, and I just burst into tears," Mire
            said. "Since that day, I've been obsessed with finding
            out who did this to that child."</p>

            <p>Police say Adem circumcised his daughter with
            scissors in his Duluth apartment, while someone else
            held the girl's legs.</p>

            <p>Authorities said the circumcision occurred sometime
            in 2001 but the mother didn't discover it until two
            years later. The mother told police she learned about
            it while arguing with Adem about female circumcision.
            The mother told police that she told Adem she didn't
            want that to happen to their daughter, but Adem implied
            the circumcision had already occurred.</p>

            <p>The mother went to a doctor who confirmed that the
            girl had been circumcised. The girl then told Gwinnett
            authorities that her father had done it. He was
            arrested in March 2003.</p>

            <p>Adem has said through his defense attorney <a
            href="http://pview.findlaw.com/view/1643606_1"
            target="_blank">W. Mark Hill</a> that he was innocent.
            Hill said the allegations stem from a bitter divorce
            and custody battle the couple was going through at the
            time. Hill has said the family of the girl's mother,
            Fortunate Adem, also is from Africa and could have
            performed the circumcision.</p>

            <p><b>Georgia law changed</b></p>

            <p>The African practice of female circumcision has been
            denounced for decades by health and human rights
            activists. In some areas in Africa, it is considered a
            coming-of-age ritual.</p>

            <p>Opponents claim the procedure, which may involve the
            removal of the clitoris or all of the external
            genitalia, is extremely painful, medically unnecessary
            and unsafe. It is illegal in the United States and has
            been condemned by the United Nations.</p>

            <p>The centuries-old practice is performed for many
            reasons, including to curtail sex drive and preserve
            virginity. It also is a prerequisite for marriage in
            some cultures, experts say.</p>

            <p>After Adem was arrested, activists and educators
            flocked to metro Atlanta to denounce genital
            mutilation. <a href="/news/ajc07-18-03/"
            target="_blank">A four-day conference on the practice
            sponsored by international women's rights group
            Equality Now was held in Atlanta three months after his
            arrest</a>. The conference was originally supposed to
            be in Nairobi, Kenya, but was moved to Atlanta because
            of the national interest following Adem's arrest, said
            Taina Bien-Aime, executive director of <a
            href="http://www.equalitynow.org/"
            target="_blank">Equality Now</a>.</p>

            <p>It is difficult to document the number of female
            circumcision prosecutions in the United States.
            Although Congress passed a law in 1996, many states
            still do not have their own laws forbidding the
            practice. But experts who follow the issue say arrests
            for female circumcision are rare.</p>

            <p>"To our knowledge, this was the first documented
            case of [female circumcision] in the United States,"
            said Bien-Aime, whose organization, which has offices
            in New York, London and Africa, has been following the
            issue since 1992. "We will be monitoring the trial and
            hope that it will help bring awareness to the
            issue."</p>

            <p>Adem's arrest also had an impact on Georgia law. In
            2003, there was no state law in Georgia that addressed
            female circumcision. That's why Adem was charged with
            aggravated battery and cruelty to children.</p>

            <p>After her ex-husband's arrest, Fortunate Adem worked
            with Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver (D-Decatur) to get a law
            passed outlawing female circumcision. The law was
            enacted in May 2005.</p>

            <p>If Khalid Adem had been arrested after the new law
            was in place, he could have faced an additional 20
            years for the genital mutilation charge.</p>

            <p>Fortunate Adem refused to comment for this article
            but has said her daughter suffered severe pain since
            the circumcision.</p>

            <p>"Her whole life has been changed," she said. "She is
            going to be traumatized psychologically. Parts of her
            body have been taken away from her without her consent.
            They need to look at this child the same way they would
            if she had been raped."</p>

            <p><b>Father claims innocence</b></p>

            <p>Hill will handle the defense case and plans to call
            eight to 10 witnesses. He said he is trying to get
            three of Adem's sisters to Gwinnett from Ethiopia to
            testify that they had not been circumcised.</p>

            <p>Another key piece of evidence will be the taped
            interview of the victim in which she told Gwinnett
            authorities that Adem cut her with scissors. It's
            unknown whether the girl, now 7, will be called to
            testify.</p>

            <p>Gwinnett Assistant <a
            href="http://www.co.gwinnett.ga.us/cgi-bin/gwincty/egov/ep/gcbrowse.do?channelId=-536881916&amp;channelPage=%2Fep%2Fchannel%2Fdefault.jsp&amp;pageTypeId=536880236"
             target="_blank">District Attorney</a> Marty First will
            handle the prosecution's case. First declined to
            comment or give any details about the case.</p>

            <p>"I will try this case in the courtroom, not in the
            media," First said.</p>

            <p>While much has been heard from Fortunate Adem
            through her efforts in changing Georgia law, this will
            be the first time that Khalid Adem will publicly tell
            his side of the story.</p>

            <p>He will testify and proclaim his innocence, Hill
            said.</p>

            <p>Adem bonded out of jail a week after he was arrested
            and continues to work as a clerk at the same Snellville
            gas station he did before his arrest, Hill said.</p>

            <p>Hill said there are major problems with the
            prosecution's case and that Adem was arrested primarily
            on the word of the then-2-year-old girl who could have
            been coached by a mother desperate to get custody.
            Another problem in the case, Hill said, is that the
            alleged circumcision, which took place in 2001, wasn't
            discovered or reported to police until two years
            later.</p>

            <p>"What mother would not know that this has happened
            to their daughter for two years?" he said.</p>

            <p>Hill said the couple's history of problems also led
            him to question the prosecution's charges.</p>

            <p>Khalid Adem immigrated to the United States from
            Ethiopia when he was 16, Hill said. Fortunate Adem
            moved to this country from South Africa when she was 6,
            according to court documents. The two met at Georgia
            Perimeter College in Clarkston. The couple was married,
            and their daughter was born on Sept. 8, 1999. The
            couple had a contentious marriage and was divorced by
            August 2003.</p>

            <p>Fortunate Adem was awarded full custody of the
            child. Adem was not granted visitation rights.</p>

            <p>The trial is expected to last about two weeks. Jury
            selection will begin Monday morning.</p>

            <p>Mire, who plans to follow the trial, said this case
            is about finding the truth for the little girl she once
            held and cried for.</p>

            <p>"My main focus is the girl," Mire said. "I hope that
            she gets everything that she needs. I am a survivor of
            this. I know the pain that she is still going to feel.
            It is brutal and terrible. I wouldn't wish this on my
            worst enemy."</p>
