            <p>A conversation with lawyer Zenas Baer, champion of
            all tomorrow's foreskins</p>

            <p>by <font color="navy"><b>Mike
            Mosedale</b></font></p>

            <p class="text">By the standards of small-town lawyers,
            <a href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a> has done it all. In a
            two-decade career working out of his hometown of Hawley
            (pop. 1655) in northwestern Minnesota, Baer has
            represented accused murderers, Native American
            governments, the <a
            href="http://www.hawley.govoffice.com/"
            target="_blank">City of Hawley</a>, and, in one
            notorious case, a defendant in Minnesota's only
            recorded casino heist. Despite the breadth of
            experience, the 51-year-old Baer seems destined to be
            remembered for what has been a relatively minor
            component of his practice: a quixotic, dogged, and
            wholly unsuccessful legal crusade against the most
            common surgical procedure performed in the U.S. today,
            the circumcision of infant boys.</p>

            <p class="text"><a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/1996.12.05_StPaul/">A
            federal judge court rejected Baer's first "anti-circ"
            lawsuit back in 1996</a>. In that case, Baer sought to
            have a North Dakota law barring female genital
            mutilation declared unconstitutional. (The law had been
            enacted to protect the daughters of African and Middle
            Eastern immigrants from ritual cutting of the
            clitoris.) Why? Because preserving the "genital
            integrity" of girls without affording the same
            protection to boys, in Baer's view, violates the equal
            protection clause of the Constitution. A federal judge,
            and a federal appeals court, disagreed.</p>

            <p class="text">Not dissuaded, Baer took a different
            tack in his latest anti-circ effort. In that lawsuit,
            he argued that a doctor and hospital in Fargo should be
            held liable for failing to fully inform the parents of
            Josiah Flatt about the risks and consequences of
            circumcision. While the boy suffered no serious
            complications from his circumcision and his parents
            signed a standard consent form, Baer maintains that the
            removal of the foreskin will lead inevitably to reduced
            sexual sensation later in life.</p>

            <p class="text">After a 10-day trial, a jury found the
            doctor not liable; <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/theforum02-14-03/">a
            judge earlier dropped the hospital from the case</a>.
            Despite the setbacks, the earnest and plainspoken Baer
            was optimistic last week, when City Pages talked to him
            about his prospects on appeal, the anti-circ movement,
            and the reasons an ancient religious ritual has become
            an ingrained feature of modern American medicine.</p>

            <p class="text"><b>City Pages:</b> How did you become
            interested in the issue of, as you say, "genital
            integrity"?</p>

            <p class="text"><b>Zenas Baer:</b> I was approached by
            some folks in 1995. They were looking for an attorney
            to challenge a North Dakota statute which made it a
            felony to alter female genitalia if the female was
            under the age of 18, but provided no protection for
            male genitalia. I did some reading on the issue and I
            concluded that circumcision is a very barbaric
            procedure perpetuated by a medical community that has
            no medical reason to continue it.</p>

            <p class="text">Usually before a medical doctor will do
            surgery, they'll have a diagnosis. A ruptured appendix.
            A broken bone. A gallbladder. There is always a
            diagnosis. With circumcision, what is the diagnosis? A
            normal, healthy newborn male. If you don't have that
            diagnosis, then you can't do a circumcision. Why the
            hell are doctors fiddling with a normal, healthy
            newborn male? To make him more perfect? That's the
            bizarre thing about it.</p>

            <p class="text"><b>CP:</b> In your current case, your
            plaintiff, Josiah Flatt, underwent a normal
            circumcision that, by all accounts, was not botched.
            Where is the harm?</p>

            <p class="text"><b>Baer:</b> The harm is the loss of
            the most erogenous tissue of the human body--a bundle
            of nerves, blood vessels, and tissue that was amputated
            without medical reason or medical benefit. And to say
            this is a normal circumcision is a little bit
            misleading. What happened was, when they did the
            circumcision it was asymmetric. A flap of foreskin
            re-adhered to the glans penis. On the left side, there
            was an extra fold of skin that was grown together with
            the glans. When [Josiah's parents] noticed that, they
            started asking questions: Is it going to impact
            function? Is he going to have to have another surgery?
            They started doing some research, and they concluded
            that if they knew the risks, they would have never
            consented.</p>

            <p class="text"><b>CP:</b> How big is the
            anti-circumcision movement? Is it making headway?</p>

            <p class="text"><b>Baer:</b> It's hard for me to judge
            the anti-circumcision movement. I don't belong to any
            anti-circumcision organizations, so I can't really
            judge the size. But I will make this observation: On
            the West Coast, only 40 percent of the baby boys born
            are being cut. That would suggest that on the West
            Coast you either have much more enlightened parents, an
            immigrant population that doesn't come from a cutting
            culture, or a medical community that takes seriously
            their obligation "First, do no harm." As the rate of
            circumcision falls, you will naturally have a greater
            number of people involved in the no-circ movement. Just
            by making that choice, they are involved, whether they
            know it or not.</p>

            <p class="text"><b>CP:</b> Do you think circumcision
            will ever become rare in the U.S?</p>

            <p class="text"><b>Baer:</b> I think there is a chance
            it will become little more than an anomaly. The
            justifications used today for circumcision are as
            specious as those justifications used at the turn of
            the century, when it was claimed that circumcision
            cures alcoholism, promiscuity, eczema, club foot, and
            scoliosis.</p>

            <p class="text"><b>CP:</b> How much money do American
            hospitals make from circumcision?</p>

            <p class="text"><b>Baer:</b> That's a good question. I
            think the AAP [American Academy of Pediatrics] <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/">statement</a>
            says it is from $170 million to $250 million
            [annually]. That figure is subject to much debate
            because it only identifies doctors' fees. It does not
            include the hospital charges, nor the additional
            hospital stay required as a result of the circumcision.
            I have heard that $500 million to a billion a year is
            being generated by this procedure. <i>In the U.S.</i>
            And if you look at circumcision, it really is only
            practiced in the U.S. Assume for a moment that in the
            next 10 minutes, 100 babies are born worldwide. Only
            three of those babies will be circumcised, and two out
            of those three will be from the United States.</p>

            <p class="text"><b>CP:</b> What are the most
            interesting responses you have received for your
            anti-circumcision efforts, both positive and
            negative?</p>

            <p class="text"><b>Baer:</b> The people who comment
            fall into two categories. Some don't understand the
            issue, and think that it is just a way for me as a
            lawyer to gain notoriety and try to get some money.
            I've had hate e-mails from Florida and other places on
            the East Coast that call me a gold-digging lawyer, and
            holding up this suit as exhibit A on the need for tort
            reform. The other people say, "My God, I didn't know
            that's what we're doing to kids. If people only knew,
            it would not continue." Most of the response has been
            very positive. I got an e-mail the other day with the
            subject heading, "Zenas, my hero."</p>

            <p class="text"><b>CP:</b> Are you circumcised?</p>

            <p class="text"><b>Baer:</b> Yep.</p>
