            <h2>Oregon Legal Battle Ignites Debate on
            Circumcision</h2>
            By Staff Reporter of the Sun<br />
            September 18, 2007 

            <p>A legal battle between divorced parents in Oregon
            about the circumcision of their 12-year-old son is fast
            becoming a flash point between critics of the procedure
            and those who endorse it on medical and religious
            grounds.<br />
            <a href="http://www.familylawattorney1.com/"
            target="_blank">James Boldt</a>, a recent convert to
            Judaism, wants his son, who is also said to be
            converting, circumcised. Mr. Boldt's ex-wife, Lia, has
            objected. Lower courts sided with Mr. Boldt, who has
            full custody of his son. However, the <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/index.htm"
             target="_blank">Oregon Supreme Court</a> has agreed to
            hear arguments in the dispute in November.<br />
            <br />
            Four Jewish organizations, the <a
            href="http://www.ajc.org/" target="_blank">American
            Jewish Committee</a>, the <a
            href="http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=homepage"
             target="_blank">American Jewish Congress</a>, the <a
            href="http://www.adl.org/"
            target="_blank">Anti-Defamation League</a>, and the <a
            href="http://www.ou.org/" target="_blank">Orthodox
            Union</a>, have joined together in an amicus curiae
            brief supporting the father's right to proceed over the
            mother's objections.<br />
            <br />
            "It is of particular importance to amici that American
            Jews be free to practice circumcision because
            circumcision is and has been one of the most
            fundamental and sacred parts of the Jewish religion,"
            the groups wrote. "Enabling the circumcision of a
            child, whether as part of a religious conversion or for
            medical reasons, cannot as a matter of law indicate any
            infirmity in a parent's ability to function as a
            parent. Moreover, any decision to single out
            circumcision as a basis for questioning the fitness of
            the custodial parent would violate the First
            Amendment's guarantee of freedom of religion."<br />
            <br />
            Ms. Boldt is being backed by a Seattle-based group, <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org"
            target="_blank">Doctors Against Circumcision</a>, which
            contends that the procedure is unnecessary and amounts
            to abuse.<br />
            <br />
            "Parents are free to practice their religion and to
            have religious beliefs, but they are not free to change
            the physical body of their child at will," the
            anti-circumcision group's executive director, John
            Geisheker, told The New York Sun.<br />
            <br />
            Mr. Boldt contends that his son wants to have the
            circumcision done. However, Mr. Geisheker said it is
            impossible to know whether the son's choice is being
            made freely.<br />
            <br />
            In <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/pdf/2007-04BoldtReview.pdf"
             target="_blank">court papers</a>, Mr. Geisheker's
            group has argued that male circumcision should not be
            permitted on constitutional grounds because many states
            have passed laws banning female genital mutilation.
            Though studies have shown less incidence of sexually
            transmitted disease in circumcised men, Mr. Geisheker
            contends that circumcision is "non-therapeutic." He
            said it is akin to an increasingly trendy procedure
            where women have the appearance of their vaginas
            altered.<br />
            <br />
            "Would you allow your 12-year-old daughter to have her
            labia trimmed for cosmetic reasons?" he asked.<br />
            <br />
            The Jewish groups warned that a decision blocking the
            circumcision would encourage litigation over all sorts
            of medical procedures for children. "Surely a parent
            has the same authority to have a child's vision
            corrected or a birthmark on his face removed even if
            those procedures are also elective and even if the
            other parent objects," they wrote. "The <a
            href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,,2015266,00.html"
             target="_blank">Jewish experience with
            circumcision</a> has shown that it is a safe and simple
            procedure with few complications."</p>
