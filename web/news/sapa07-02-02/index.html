            <h2>13 initiates in Umtata hospital</h2>

            <p>Umtata - Another mutilated initiation candidate has
            been admitted to the Umtata General Hospital in the
            Eastern Cape, bringing the total admitted since the
            weekend to 13.</p>

            <p>The hospital's acting chief medical superintendent,
            Dr Zola Dabula, said the condition of all the
            post-circumcision initiation candidates was "very
            stable".</p>

            <p>Dabula said they were suffering from minor genital
            infections - the result of unhygienic practices - and
            were being kept in a holding ward.</p>

            <p>However, Dabula said there were another four
            teenagers - who had been in hospital for about a week -
            being kept in a separate ward.</p>

            <p>Their condition was stable, but more serious, he
            said. Three of them had acute dehydration while <span
            class="yellow">the fourth lost his penis when it fell
            off because of gangrene.</span></p>

            <p>Dabula said that boys whose penises fell off after
            circumcision had to live with a urinary catheter and a
            bag for about a year before penile reconstructive
            surgery could be done.</p>

            <p>Speaking of the boys' life after surgery, Dabula
            said: "It's not a normal life as such - they can
            urinate, but they are compromised in their sexual
            activity."</p>

            <p>The Eastern Cape government last year passed
            legislation to regulate circumcision practices, making
            initiation school surgeons liable to six- to 10-year
            prison sentences if they broke the law.</p>

            <p><b>Corrupt, cruel places, says doc</b></p>

            <p>The province also launched an education and
            awareness programme aimed at encouraging people to have
            their circumcision done in hospitals.</p>

            <p>Dabula said: "I must say that previously... we had
            very serious problems with circumcision in this area.
            <span class="yellow">Last year, in December, we lost
            two patients.</span> But, right now, we haven't lost
            anyone... I give credit to our educational process.</p>

            <p>"We have created a system in which people who would
            like to be circumcised medically come to us. We
            circumcise them and afterwards they go and finish their
            initiation into manhood in the bush."</p>

            <p>But Dabula also said that initiation schools today
            were corrupt and cruel places that were, in no way,
            representative of African traditions.</p>

            <p>"Previously, the surgeon, who was chosen by the
            family, was an experienced person who had undergone
            supervisional work.</p>

            <p>"Then, experienced people looked after the wound.
            They were called amakhankatha. Nowadays, amakhankatha
            are not experienced.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">"The problem with the today's
            schools is that they are more than anything a place of
            vengeance. People who got beaten to a pulp in their day
            are there to inflict upon others the treatment they
            got," said Dabula.</span></p>
