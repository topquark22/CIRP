            <h2>Male circumcision should be cut</h2>

            <h3>While there are laws preventing female genital
            mutilation in Denmark, there are none preventing male
            genital mutilation. Demands for action.</h3>

            <p><b>The <a href="http://www.boerneraadet.dk/"
            target="_blank">Children's Council</a> and the Chair of
            the <a href="http://www.etiskraad.dk/sw293.asp"
            target="_blank">Ethical Council</a> say it is
            objectionable and ethically indefensible that while
            there is a law preventing female genital mutilation, no
            such law exists for males.</b><br />
            <br />
             Both the Jewish, Muslim and other traditions call for
            the circumcision of males. In Denmark, the Chief Rabbi
            Bent Lexner carries out the circumcision of Jewish
            boys. Muslim circumcisions are often carried out in
            clinics or hospitals.<br />
            <br />
             <b>Religious links</b><br />
             The Children's Council Chair Charlotte Guldberg says
            the practice should be stopped.<br />
            <br />
             "There is a deep problem here. Society is in no doubt
            that the genital mutilation of girls is unacceptable -
            but we accept it with boys and have tolerated it for
            many years because it is linked to religion. It is
            gender discrimination from birth that we make a
            distinction between boys and girls," says Gulberg, who
            adds that circumscision should be banned for boys under
            15 years of age. According to tradition, young Jewish
            boys are circumcised at the age of eight days.<br />
            <br />
             <b>Voice</b><br />
             The Ethical Council does not have a general view of
            circumcision, although Chairman Peder Agger does not
            immediately reject the notion of legislation.<br />
            <br />
             "There is an ethical problem. I would prefer people to
            wait until the child is 15, thus respecting his right
            to choose and so that he knows what is going on. I
            believe that one should not undertake physical
            procedures that leave lasting scars or have lasting
            effect until a child is 15. And there should be some
            discussion as to whether the procedure should be
            ritualised in another way. In Denmark we have also
            stopped putting a child's head completely under water
            during baptism," says Agger.<br />
            <br />
             <b>Symbolic</b><br />
             In the United States there is an increasing tendency
            to carry out symbolic male circumcision by simply
            pricking the foreskin to draw blood. But in Denmark, as
            in many other countries, boys have the entire foreskin
            removed.<br />
            <br />
             <b>Covenant</b><br />
             In the religious tradition, circumcision is part of
            the covenant reported between God and Abraham. The
            relevant passage regarding Abraham is found in Genesis
            17: 9-14 and reads:<br />
            <br />
             "Then God said to Abraham, "As for you, you must keep
            my covenant, you and your descendants after you for the
            generations to come. This is my covenant with you and
            your descendants after you, the covenant you are to
            keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised. You
            are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of
            the covenant between me and you. For the generations to
            come every male among you who is eight days old must be
            circumcised, including those born in your household or
            bought with money from a foreigner--those who are not
            your offspring. Whether born in your household or
            bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My
            covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting
            covenant. Any uncircumcised male, who has not been
            circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his
            people; he has broken my covenant."<br />
            <br />
             <b>Violation</b><br />
             Nonetheless, religions cannot set themselves outside
            norms and violate a child's physical integrity
            according to <a
            href="http://jur.ku.dk/english/staff/homepages/kirstenketscher/english/"
             target="_blank">Kirsten Ketscher</a>, Professor of
            Social Law at <a href="http://www.ku.dk/English/"
            target="_blank">Copenhagen University</a>. She tells <a
            href="http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/"
            target="_blank">Kristeligt Dagblad</a> that the
            procedure should wait until a child is old enough to
            decide itself.<br />
            <br />
             <b>Reject</b><br />
             Chief Rabbi Bent Lexner, who has received special
            training in the procedure, rejects both the idea of a
            legal ban and the introduction of symbolic
            circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             "Jews have been fighting for many years to maintain
            the tradition, as it is a sign of Jewish identity. Even
            among Jewish families who do not live according to
            Jewish practice there are only very few who do not have
            their children circumcised. If you want to be part of
            the Jewish people, you have to fulfill precisely that
            rule. Getting rid of circumcision would be the same as
            removing baptism from the Christian faith," says Chief
            Rabbi Lexner.<br />
            <br />
             Imam Abdul Wahid Pedersen says that parents exert
            their decisions on children in many other issues
            also.<br />
            <br />
             "They decide what clothes children have to wear so
            they aren't bullied. And if children are to be able to
            decide, why shouldn't they be able to decide themselves
            whether to be baptised," the Imam tells Kristeligt
            Dagblad.<br />
            <br />
             There are some Christian directions and sects who
            practice circumcision. These are predominantly the
            Coptic, Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox churches.</p>
