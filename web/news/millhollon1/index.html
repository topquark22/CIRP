            <h2>Patient for heart bypass sues over
            circumcision</h2>

            <p>By MICHELLE MILLHOLLON<br />
             Advocate staff writer</p>

            <p>A man who underwent surgery for a bypass at Earl K.
            Long Medical Center has sued saying the hospital
            circumcised him without his consent.</p>

            <p>The hospital has said the circumcision was a
            necessary part of the bypass surgery, which was not
            completed because of complications.</p>

            <p>Robert Banks sued the hospital and <a
            href="http://cgi.photobooks.com/scripts/troll.cgi?dbase=tulaneweb&amp;display=Y&amp;page=2&amp;specialty=general+surgery&amp;pict_id=2400980"
             target="_blank">Dr. Mary Jo Wright</a> on Wednesday in
            <a href="http://www.ebrclerkofcourt.org/"
            target="_blank">19th Judicial Court</a>.</p>

            <p>Banks says in the suit that he woke up from surgery
            on Aug. 15, 1995, and discovered he'd been
            circumcised.</p>

            <p>His attorney, <a href="http://www.mwtlaw.net/"
            target="_blank">Alicia Hoover</a>, says no one ever
            discussed the possibility of a circumcision with
            Banks.</p>

            <p>"It's troubling," Hoover said. "I don't think anyone
            who goes in for bypass surgery would ever expect or
            anticipate (they) would wake up and find that they've
            been circumcised."</p>

            <p>But the state <a href="http://www.ag.state.la.us/"
            target="_blank">Attorney General's Office</a> has said
            in court documents that the circumcision was a
            necessary procedure.</p>

            <p>Earl K. Long Medical Center is a state hospital.</p>

            <p>The state says in documents filed in response to an
            earlier suit that a bladder catheterization to monitor
            kidney function was necessary to the bypass.</p>

            <p>A circumcision had to be performed in order to do
            the catheterization, the documents say.</p>

            <p>However, doctors had to close up Banks' chest
            without performing the bypass because of complications
            that arose during the surgery.</p>

            <p>Hoover says Banks is now too terrified to undergo
            any further surgeries.</p>

            <p>Banks first filed suit in 1996 alleging medical
            battery.</p>

            <p>The state argued he was actually alleging medical
            malpractice and needed to first go before the state
            medical review panel.</p>

            <p>State District Judge <a
            href="http://www.ebrclerkofcourt.org/misc/judges.htm">Curtis
            Calloway</a> ruled the circumcision was medical
            battery, not medical malpractice.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.la-fcca.org/"
            target="_blank">1st Circuit Court of Appeal</a> later
            reversed the ruling.</p>

            <p>The appellate court said Banks' lawsuit involved
            medical malpractice and would first have to be
            submitted to the state medical review panel.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.la-fcca.org/judges.htm"
            target="_blank">Judge Brady Fitzsimmons</a> dissented,
            saying the surgical team could have awakened Banks and
            gotten his permission for the circumcision.</p>

            <p>Hoover said Thursday that the state medical review
            panel concluded malpractice had not been committed.
            That decision cleared the way for Banks to proceed with
            a lawsuit.</p>

            <p>Barry Toups, a state assistant attorney general,
            said the circumcision was neither medical battery nor
            medical malpractice.</p>
