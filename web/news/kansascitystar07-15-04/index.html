            <h2>Mother seeks high court order to block
            circumcision</h2>

            <p>By STEVE ROCK<br />
            The Kansas City Star</p>

            <p>A Lee's Summit woman is asking the <a
            href="http://www.courts.mo.gov/sup/index.nsf"
            target="_blank">Missouri Supreme Court</a> to prevent
            the "unneeded and irreparable'' circumcision of her
            almost 3-year-old son.</p>

            <p>The attorney for Camille Azar filed a petition for a
            writ of prohibition Wednesday with the Supreme Court,
            effectively asking the state's highest court to reverse
            a decision made in <a
            href="http://www.16thcircuit.org/"
            target="_blank">Jackson County Circuit Court</a>.
            Ultimately, Azar hopes to stop Ray Jagoda, the child's
            father, from having their son circumcised.</p>

            <p>The child turns 3 in September and, according to the
            petition, is "aware of his own body."</p>

            <p>"The potential for psychological harm from
            non-infant circumcisions is well established and
            great," the petition states.</p>

            <p>Michael Whitsitt, the attorney for Jagoda, said
            Wednesday he had no comment about the latest
            development in the case.</p>

            <p>Jagoda and Azar never married, and Jackson County
            Circuit <a
            href="http://www.16thcircuit.org/Divisions/division.asp?div=31">
            Judge Christine Sill-Rogers</a> granted full custody to
            Jagoda earlier this year. Azar, who was the child's
            primary caregiver until he was about 29 months old, has
            appealed that ruling.</p>

            <p>Her immediate concern, she said Wednesday, is
            preventing a circumcision that she deems unnecessary
            and potentially harmful. According to the petition
            filed with the Supreme Court, "Mr. Jagoda has indicated
            that he is determined to circumcise the child
            immediately, with or without a doctor, with or without
            anesthesia."</p>

            <p>Azar said Wednesday that, according to studies she
            has read and experts she has spoken with, her son's age
            might be the worst for a child to be circumcised.</p>

            <p>"This is the most frightening age and damaging age
            psychologically," she said. "I have to protect him.</p>

            <p>"He knows his body very well. He's aware enough to
            understand what his body is like now but not able to
            understand why part of that would be taken away. Kids
            this age see the operation as a punishment, a
            mutilation, a castration."</p>

            <p>Azar said she is generally opposed to the idea of
            circumcision. If her son were old enough to decide for
            himself, she said, she wouldn't object.</p>

            <p>So she's taking her fight to the state's highest
            court.</p>

            <p>According to legal rules, Whitsitt has 10 days to
            file suggestions and oppositions.</p>

            <p>"Circumcision would be the removal of perfectly
            healthy tissue from a person not legally competent to
            object," the petition states. "Circumcision is
            non-reversible amputation. It is the permanent
            destruction of living, non-threatening, sensitive
            tissue."</p>
