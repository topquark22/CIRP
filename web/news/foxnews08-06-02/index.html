            <h2>Routine Procedure or Child Abuse?</h2>
            by Wendy McElroy 

            <p><b>A disconcerting issue has hit the political
            radar: male circumcision. Is it a medical procedure or
            child abuse?</b></p>

            <p>As furor over <a
            href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200207310264.html"
            target="_blank">female genital mutilation</a> grows, so
            does the criticism of male circumcision.</p>

            <p>This June, Arizona eliminated Medicaid funding for
            infant circumcision, following the lead of six other
            states: California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, North
            Dakota, and Mississippi. In July, a <a
            href="http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/stories/newswire080102a.htm"
             target="_blank">North Dakota court</a> ruled that an
            adult male could sue the doctor who circumcised him
            even though the parents had consented and there was no
            "botch." <em>Flatt v. Kantak</em> became the latest in
            a series of <a
            href="http://circumvent.org/Lawsuits.htm">circumcision
            cases</a> that test the legal status of the
            procedure.</p>

            <p>Circumcision has been under attack for the last few
            years. In 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics <a
            href="http://www.aap.org/advocacy/archives/marcircum.htm"
             target="_blank">revised its guidelines</a> to state,
            "the benefits are not significant enough for the AAP to
            recommend circumcision as a routine procedure." In
            2000, the American Medical Association <a
            href="http://www.nocirc.org/position/ama2000.html"
            target="_blank">modified its policy</a> to read,
            "Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential
            medical benefits ... however, these data are not
            sufficient to recommend routine neonatal
            circumcision."</p>

            <p>Yet most male babies in <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statistics/USA/"
            target="_blank">North America</a> continue to be
            circumcised. Advocates loudly proclaim its advantages
            for men, including an HIV-protective effect for men,
            and its benefits for women---those with circumcised
            partners are said to have a reduced risk of <a
            href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/healthscience/health/women/2002-04-11-cervical.htm"
             target="_blank">cervical cancer</a>.</p>

            <p>Yet the central question keeps returning: Is the
            removal of any part of a healthy sexual organ
            justified?</p>

            <p>The passionate debate has implications far wider
            than medicine. One is equality under the law. Female
            genitalia mutilation is already a criminal act under
            Title 18 <a href="http://www.fgm.org/USCode.html"
            target="_blank">United States Code Section 116</a>,
            which reads, in part, "whoever knowingly circumcises,
            excises, or infibulates the whole or <em>any part</em>
            of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of
            another person who has not attained the age of 18 years
            shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more
            than&nbsp;five years, or both." [Emphasis added.]</p>

            <p>Procedures necessary to health are excluded.</p>

            <p>To remove any part of healthy male genitalia would
            seem to be an act parallel in law to female genital
            mutilation. Indeed, the plaintiff in <em>Flatt v.
            Kantak</em> will probably argue along these lines.</p>

            <p>What does this mean for <a
            href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture/Religion_and_Spirituality/Faiths_and_Practices/Judaism/Beliefs_and_Practices/Rites_of_Passage/Brit_Milah/"
             target="_blank">Jewish ritual circumcision</a>, called
            Brit Milah---a sign of the Jewish covenant with God?
            The U.S. Code against mutilating female genitalia makes
            no exception for religion or culture. It states, "no
            account shall be taken of the effect on the person on
            whom the operation is to be performed of any belief on
            the part of that person, or any other person, that the
            operation is required as a matter of custom or
            ritual."</p>

            <p>If variations of Islamic religion and culture do not
            justify mutilating women, then can religion justify
            non-therapeutic male circumcision? Nothing in
            international or domestic law would seem to allow the
            discriminatory banning of only female genital
            mutilation. Indeed, for decades, international law has
            come down against routine circumcision. For example,
            the U.N.'s <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-human/"
            target="_blank">Universal Declaration of Human
            Rights</a> (1948) speaks of the "human rights" involved
            in "the ethics of circumcision," which are "the rights
            to security of person, to freedom from torture and
            other cruel and unusual treatment, and to privacy."</p>

            <p>Those who claim that the mutilation of female
            genitalia cannot be likened to circumcision should read
            the many <a
            href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Law.html"
            target="_blank">anti-circumcision sites</a> that offer
            horror stories. <a
            href="http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/botch.htm"
            target="_blank">Mothers Against Circumcision</a> claim
            that these "side effects" are not uncommon and that
            circumcision has inherent and universal disadvantages,
            such as a diminishment of sexual pleasure.</p>

            <p>Circumcision is also a moral issue. The organization
            <a
            href="http://faculty.washington.edu/gcd/DOC/end.html"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>
            decries the procedure as "painful," "tragic,"
            "contra-indicated," and states "that no one has the
            right to forcibly remove sexual body parts from another
            individual." DOC claims that circumcision violates the
            physician's Golden Rule---First, Do No Harm ---as well
            as all seven principles of the A.M.A. Code of
            Ethics.</p>

            <p>These are merely some of the political and moral
            questions surrounding circumcision. For better or
            worse, the parameters of this issue may well be
            determined in the courts through lawyers' arguments and
            judges' decisions. Which brings us back to <em>Flatt v.
            Kantak</em>.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, this case muddies the discussion by
            introducing other significant issues. For example,
            since the parents consented, the case implicitly asks
            whether parents have a right to make decisions about
            their children's bodies. Or is the real issue "informed
            consent"? Do doctors need to fully reveal all the
            possible side effects of, current thinking on and
            alternatives to circumcision, so that it is no longer
            "routine"?</p>

            <p>On the other hand, if circumcision is legally shown
            to be a form of criminal harm, then the "informed
            consent" of parents may be irrelevant: doctors, nurses,
            hospitals, and mohels might be held criminally liable,
            alongside parents, for child abuse.</p>

            <p>As medical associations one-by-one refuse to support
            routine circumcision, the procedure is losing
            ground---medically, morally, politically, and legally.
            This process is being sped along by aggressive groups
            like <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/"
            target="_blank">The National Organization of
            Circumcision Information Resource Centers</a>, a
            "non-profit educational organization committed to
            securing the birthright of male and female children and
            babies to keep their sexual organs intact."</p>

            <p>The ensuing debate will help define medical ethics
            for a new generation.</p>
