            05/07/2005 11:40 - (SA) 

            <p>Cape Town - Three more boys have died as a result of
            botched circumcisions in the Eastern Cape, bringing the
            death toll over the past few weeks to 12.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/municipality/content.asp?PageID=742&amp;buster=2005%2F06%2F19+04%3A15%3A29+PM#"
             target="_blank">Provincial health department</a>
            spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said a 14-year-old from an
            illegal initiation school at Zele in the Libode area
            died on arrival at Libode's St Barnabas hospital on
            Monday evening.</p>

            <p>Two other boys died on Monday afternoon at illegal
            schools at Lutshaya village near Port St Johns, and at
            Kwagcuda in the Lusikisiki area.</p>

            <p>The traditional surgeon who ran the school where the
            14-year-old was circumcised, 53-year-old Mtshiyelwa
            Ndoda, appeared in the Libode magistrate's court on
            Tuesday morning on charges under the province's
            circumcision law.</p>

            <p>He was denied bail, and would appear again on July
            19.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said another boy had died earlier at Ndoda's
            school, and a third had to have his gangrenous penis
            amputated.</p>

            <p>Though Ndoda appeared on Tuesday only on the
            circumcision act charges, police had opened a murder
            docket. Ndoda was convicted last year of running an
            illegal initiation school and given a three-year
            suspended jail sentence.</p>

            <p><b>Rescued five boys</b></p>

            <p>Kupelo said health department officials and police
            on Monday rescued about five boys from an illegal
            school at Zandkwana village near Libode.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Three of the boys were now in a
            critical condition in hospital with gangrenous
            penises.</span></p>

            <p>Raids would continue in the Libode area on Tuesday,
            and the Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders would
            be deploying about 20 senior traditional leaders to
            Pondoland from Thursday, to talk to parents and
            traditional leaders in the areas where illegal
            circumcision was continuing.</p>

            <p>The Eastern Cape's circumcision law lays down that
            schools and traditional surgeons and nurses must all be
            registered, and that boys must be at least 18 years old
            to participate.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Libode police are investigating a murder
            charge after relatives on Tuesday reported the death of
            <b>Mzuvukile Jokwe</b>, 35, of Ngolo village, who was
            forcibly circumcised by a group of men on the night of
            June 24.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said Jokwe apparently died immediately after
            the circumcision, which appeared to be an act of
            victimisation.</p>
