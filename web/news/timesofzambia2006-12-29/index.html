            <h2>150 bags of fertiliser deal rebounds</h2>

            <p>By Times Reporter</p>

            <p>POLICE in Mpongwe have arrested an officer from the
            ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, a businessman
            and a councillor for alleged theft of 150 bags of
            fertiliser meant for the Fertilizer Support Programme
            (FSP). Copperbelt Province police chief, Antoneill
            Mutentwa, said the trio had been charged with obtaining
            goods by false pretence. The trio is detained at
            Mpongwe police station pending trial. Mr Mutentwa, who
            confirmed the arrest of the three in an interview in
            Ndola yesterday, said police impounded a truck ferrying
            the fertiliser on December 3, 2006 at 16:00 hours at
            Ibenga check-point after a tip-off from members of the
            public. &ldquo;Police received information that
            fertiliser meant for the Fertiliser Support Programme
            was diverted and was being transported to
            Luanshya,&rdquo; he said. The agricultural officer was
            alleged to have sold 30 bags of Urea worth K2.4 million
            while the businessman, who is a member of Tobombeshi
            Cooperative Society, was alleged to have sold 40 bags
            of Compound D and Urea worth K2.8 million. The
            councillor was alleged to have sold 80 bags of Compound
            D and Urea worth K3.8 million.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">In Kitwe, a 15-year-old boy of
            Nkana East township died after being circumcised. Both
            Kitwe district police chief, Dobson Siame and the
            boy&rsquo;s father, Patrick Fwalanga, confirmed the
            death of the boy. Mr Siame said the doctor who
            conducted the circumcision on the boy had been arrested
            and was in police custody. Mr Fwalanga said he decided
            to take his three sons aged 17, 15 and 10 years for
            circumcision. However, around 16:00 hours when his sons
            went home the 15-year-old boy was already weak.
            &ldquo;I can confirm that I took my three sons aged 17,
            15 and 10 for circumcision. Two, who are aged 17 and 10
            survived the circumcision, but the 15-year-old boy did
            not manage. He died on the way and was taken to the
            hospital already dead,&rdquo; Mr Fwalanga
            said.</span></p>
