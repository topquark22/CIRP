      <p>The Traditional Affairs standing committee will hold
      public hearings on the Traditional Circumcision bill
      throughout the Eastern Cape next week, the Legislature's
      assistant head of committees Oxley Ngqele said yesterday.
      (subs: fri)</p>

      <p>The aim was to get oral and written submisions from the
      public. The bill seeks to establish hygenic standards during
      the rite and to regulate the operation of circumcision
      schools.</p>

      <p>It also seeks to set a minimum age limit of 18 on
      initiates who must also undergo a pre-circumcision medical
      examination by a medical doctor. A medical certificate must
      also be issued afterwards.</p>

      <p>The bill states that traditional surgeons should be known
      to the parents of the initiate and that they must use
      instruments approved by the parents.</p>

      <p>In a bid to avoid the transmission of sexual diseases and
      Aids, the bill wants to ensure that an instrument used on one
      initiate must not be used to circumsice another. Traditional
      surgeons will also be compelled by law to use instruments
      supplied by a medical officer assigned to that area by the
      Health MEC.</p>
