      <h4>More parents deciding to forgo circumcision for newborn
      sons</h4>
      <br />
      BY <a href="mailto:tawheeler@thebeaconjournal.com">TRACY
      WHEELER</a><br />
      <i>Beacon Journal medical writer</i> 

      <p>Her parents were against her. Her in-laws were against
      her. Her husband was against her. And the medical
      establishment, if it wasn't against her, it certainly wasn't
      offering any insight.</p>

      <p>In deciding whether to circumcise her newborn son, Tina
      Lesniok was all alone. And struggling.</p>

      <p>``When I had my son, I was asking a lot of people working
      at the hospital questions about the pros and cons of
      circumcision,'' she said. ``No one could really tell me
      anything. I even asked the guy who came in to empty the trash
      can in my hospital room what he thought.</p>

      <p>``I got no information while I was pregnant. I got no
      information while I was in the hospital. I think doctors just
      assume everyone will do it.''</p>

      <p>Not Lesniok.</p>

      <p>She -- like a mounting number of parents nationwide --
      decided against tradition and societal pressures, choosing to
      forgo circumcision.</p>

      <p>In the late 1960s, about 85 percent of newborn boys
      nationwide were circumcised, according to <a
      href="http://www.hcia.com/findings/990513_circum.htm">HCIA-Sachs</a>,
      a health information firm serving the insurance industry.
      Now, the percentage has slipped to about 65 percent.</p>

      <p>And in the past year, both the <a
      href="/library/statements/ama2000/">American Medical
      Association</a> and the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">American Academy of
      Pediatrics</a> have revised their official stances, saying
      that circumcision is not medically necessary.</p>

      <p>While Lesniok's research told her that four years ago,
      family and friends said otherwise. They warned her of
      infections. They told her the other boys would make fun of
      him in the locker room. They said he should look like
      Dad.</p>

      <p>None of those arguments swayed her.</p>

      <p>``The deciding factor for me came when I was holding my
      son in my arms, knowing how much I loved him and knowing that
      I didn't want to do anything to cause him pain,'' Lesniok
      said. ``He was born perfect. He was born this way for a
      reason.''</p>

      <p><b>The `vast majority'</b></p>

      <p>By far, the practice of circumcision is most common here
      in the Midwest. In 1997 -- the most recent statistical year
      available from the <a
      href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/">National Center for Health
      Statistics</a> -- 82 percent of newborn Midwestern boys were
      circumcised. That compares with 38 percent in the West, 65
      percent in the South and 68 percent in the Northeast.</p>

      <p>As far as Akron obstetrician/gynecologist Dr. Ken Davis
      can tell, though, Akron isn't following a national trend away
      from circumcision.</p>

      <p>``I'd have to say that the proportion of patients that go
      ahead with it are the vast, vast majority,'' said Davis, who
      has performed an estimated 1,000 circumcisions in the past 20
      years. ``Most who don't have it done, in my recent
      experience, have been for cultural reasons -- Asians,
      Indians, it's something they often don't do.</p>

      <p>``Probably 99 percent do it. It's really exceptional if
      someone doesn't have it done.''</p>

      <p>Steven Hunter is hoping to change that.</p>

      <p>Six years ago, while vacationing in Venice Beach, Fla.,
      Hunter was confronted by anti-circumcision advocates.
      Suddenly, he began to fixate on an issue he had never even
      thought about before.</p>

      <p>``I was confronted with the literature and it shocked
      me,'' he said. ``I began to look at it as a personal
      violation. I was shocked to see what had been done to me as
      an infant.''</p>

      <p>He returned to Akron from vacation and he became angry,
      resenting his parents for taking away a part of him.
      Promptly, he organized the local chapter of NOCIRC, the <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/">National Organization of
      Circumcision Information Resource Centers</a>, which is based
      in the San Francisco Bay area.</p>

      <p>Last week, for the first time, the group went public,
      demonstrating in front of Akron City Hospital, holding signs
      that read ``Whose Body Whose Rights?'' and ``No Medical
      Excuse for Child Abuse!''</p>

      <p>``Children and infants are the least represented members
      of society,'' Hunter said. ``They should have the same rights
      as adults. If you did this to an adult by force, like we do
      to infants, I don't have to tell you what would happen. You'd
      be prosecuted.''</p>

      <p><b>A lifetime of loss</b></p>

      <p>Other groups have sprung up across the country to protest
      circumcision: Newborn Rights Society, NOHARMM (<a
      href="http://www.noharmm.org/">National Organization to Halt
      the Abuse and Routine Mutilation of Males</a>), DOC (Doctors
      Opposing Circumcision), NORM (<a
      href="http://www.norm.org/">National Organization for
      Restoring Men</a>), and <a
      href="http://childrightsnurses.org/">Nurses for the Rights of
      Children</a> <i>[sic]</i>, among others. Some of these --
      such as NOCIRC, NOHARMM and NORM -- go beyond the surgical
      procedure of circumcision, arguing that circumcised men are
      forced into a lifetime of loss, even if they aren't aware of
      it.</p>

      <p>Davis scoffs at these notions.</p>

      <p>``It's not a terrifically complicated issue when you come
      right down to it,'' Davis said. ``From a medical perspective,
      as far as the procedure itself goes, it's really a minor
      procedure. Removing a centimeter of skin -- it takes me about
      90 seconds. We're not talking about someone having to make a
      major decision like a heart transplant.''</p>

      <p>As for groups like NOCIRC, he said, ``I sort of put them
      in the same category as People for the Ethical Treatment of
      Animals. These are people with not enough in their lives to
      keep them busy. On top of that, it's the parents' decision;
      it's their child. ``Demonstrate the major harm. I don't think
      you can.''</p>

      <p>According to the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">American Academy of
      Pediatrics</a>, the risks of circumcision are extremely low.
      Only about 0.2 percent of circumcisions -- or 1 out of 476 --
      lead to complications. Still, Hunter and Lesniok do see harm,
      pointing to two serious complications locally. In 1994, a
      2-day-old boy's penis was severed at the tip during a botched
      circumcision at <a href="http://medinahospital.org/">Medina
      General Hospital</a>; it was later reattached. In 1998, <a
      href="http://www.noharmm.org/evansdeath.htm">a 1-month-old
      boy died from anesthesia complications</a>, during a surgery
      to correct a circumcision at <a
      href="http://www.uhrainbow.com/first2.html">Rainbow Babies
      and Children's Hospital</a> in Cleveland.</p>

      <p>``I don't think there's any justification for this,''
      Hunter said.</p>

      <p>Even without complications, he said, a healthy baby is
      being subjected to unnecessary surgery -- a surgery in which
      the infant's arms and legs are strapped down; a surgery that
      is done without anesthesia.</p>

      <p><b>`Cultural sensitivity'</b></p>

      <p>``It's not a question of the baby experiencing
      discomfort,'' argues Davis, who doesn't use anesthesia for
      newborn circumcisions. ``A big part of this comes from the
      parent. As a man, we become sensitized to the genital area.
      When there's any thought of something being done to that, we
      think, `Oh my gosh, no!'</p>

      <p>``A baby doesn't have that cultural sensitivity. It's just
      like poking the heel to draw blood. Does it really matter
      what you're poking? I don't know the answer to that. I don't
      know that anybody does. Certainly, the baby cries. But babies
      cry at many of the procedures.''</p>

      <p>However, a <a href="/library/pain/anand/">1987 study</a>
      in the New England Journal of Medicine argues that newborns,
      as well as fetuses, can feel pain, based on measurements of
      heart rate, blood pressure, motor responses, facial
      expressions and cortisol levels. A <a
      href="/library/pain/taddio2/">1997 study</a> in the British
      medical journal the Lancet argued that circumcised infants
      showed a stronger pain response to routine vaccinations than
      uncircumcised infants.</p>

      <p>And part of the American Academy of Pediatrics' <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">revised policy</a>
      includes an urging to use anesthetic for circumcision. The
      problem, Lesniok said, is that too few parents know about the
      research surrounding circumcision. No matter what a parent
      decides, she said, it should be based on an informed opinion.
      That's why she formed the Cleveland-area NOCIRC chapter after
      her son was born. ``In birthing classes, they teach you how
      to feed your baby, how to breast-feed, how to change a
      diaper, but they don't talk about circumcision,'' she said.
      ``In this country, it's so accepted. It's always been done,
      so we don't think about it, we just do it.''</p>
