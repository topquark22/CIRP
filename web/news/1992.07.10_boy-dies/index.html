        <h2>BOY IN COMA MOST OF HIS 6 YEARS DIES</h2>
        The Associated Press
      </center>
      Spartanburg, South Carolina. A boy who was in a coma for more
      than six years while a legal battle raged around him has
      died. But the legal fighting will continue. 

      <p>Allen A. Ervin was born in July 1985 and had been on life
      support since December 1985, when <span class="yellow">his
      brain was damaged from oxygen deprivation during
      circumcision.</span></p>

      <p>He died at Spartanburg Regional Medical Center on
      Wednesday, three weeks before his 7th birthday. Doctors said
      he suddenly suffered severe heart problems, his mother,
      Stacey Stroble, said.</p>

      <p>The Anesthesiologists who attended to Allen during the
      circumcision settled the case for $435,000 and agreed to
      lifetime payment of his medical bills.</p>

      <p><a

       target="_blank">Spartanburg County Probate Court</a>
      officials are overseeing the estate. Lawyer Charles Rice, who
      is in charge of investing the money, says a judge will have
      to decide who gets it.</p>

      <p>It angers Stroble, 21, who has two young daughters, that
      she may have to hire another attorney to file a claim for her
      son's estate.</p>

      <p>"The money's not my concern right now," she said. "But I
      have to pay for the funeral. I don't think that's right."</p>

      <p>Allen's medical problems began when oxygen was pushed into
      his stomach, instead of his lungs, court records showed.
      Anesthesiologists inserted a tube into the baby's stomach to
      relieve the pressure but administered three times the
      recommended dosage of a drug to slow his abnormally high
      heart rate, stopping it.</p>

      <p>He was revived 30 minutes later but never regained
      consciousness, although Stroble said Allen's eyes and head
      often followed the voices of people visiting him in his
      hospital room.</p>

      <p>The legal problems began before that, however.</p>

      <p>Stroble was 14 years old and unmarried when she gave birth
      to Allen. At the request of her mother, Maggie Ervin, a
      Family Court judge in October 1985 placed both mother and
      child in the custody of the <a
      href="http://www.state.sc.us/dss/" target="_blank">South
      Carolina Department of Social Services</a>.</p>

      <p>The custody disputes and guardianship fights went through
      seven state and federal courts, including the state Supreme
      Court and the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond,
      Virginia.</p>
