            <h2>Circumcision may lower men's risk of getting
            HIV</h2>

            <p><b>By: Ryan Boetel</b></p>

            <p>A recent study by the National Institute of Allergy
            and Infectious Diseases found that circumcision may
            reduce a man's risk of becoming infected with HIV.</p>

            <p>But that doesn't necessarily mean uncircumcised
            Nebraskans should rush into the procedure, said Pat
            Tetreault, a sexuality education coordinator for the <a
            href="http://www.unl.edu/health/"
            target="_blank">University Health Center</a>.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">"Some people look at it as a
            form of male genital mutilation," Tetreault said.
            "Others look at it as a bad thing to do to
            boys."</span></p>

            <p>Carolyn Williams, chief of Epidemiology Division of
            AIDS for <a href="http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/"
            target="_blank">NIAID</a>, said the study could have
            the largest impact on parts of the world with a high
            prevalence of HIV and a low percentage of circumcised
            men.</p>

            <p>"Circumcision is a cultural practice," Williams
            said. She said parts of the world with a high
            percentage of the population living with HIV or AIDS
            could see an improvement, but it will take time.</p>

            <p>"After there is a decline in the number if males
            living with HIV, then the number of females living with
            the virus will drop accordingly," Williams said in a
            phone interview from NIAID in Maryland.</p>

            <p>NIAID performed two studies in Africa. In Kisumu,
            Kenya, 2,784 HIV-negative men were studied, and in
            Rakai, Uganda, another 4,996 HIV-negative men were
            involved.</p>

            <p>In Kenya, the circumcised men reduced their chances
            of becoming infected with HIV by 53 percent. In Uganda,
            the decrease was 48 percent.</p>

            <p>The Kenyan males were circumcised using the "<a
            href="/library/procedure/gomco/">clamp</a>" method, and
            the Ugandan males were circumcised with the "<a
            href="http://www.aafp.org/afp/990315ap/1514.html"
            target="_blank">sleeve</a>" method.</p>

            <p>"We have done the research," Williams said. "Now we
            turn the research over to <a href="http://www.who.int"
            target="_blank">WHO</a> (World Health Organization) and
            <a href="http://www.unaids.org/en/"
            target="_blank">UNAIDS</a> (the United Nations program
            on AIDS) and let them offer guidance."</p>

            <p>In Nebraska, when it comes to looking at the risk of
            contracting HIV, <span class="yellow">circumcision "is
            normally not considered an issue,"</span> said Alberto
            Cervantes, Latino outreach manager for the Nebraska
            AIDS Project.</p>

            <p>The number of sexual partners a person has had, what
            type of sex he or she is engaging in and whether
            condoms are being used are typical factors. "But we
            never ask an individual if he is circumcised,"
            Cervantes said.</p>

            <p>Cervantes said he had heard of the study and would
            "definitely" recommend circumcision for anyone
            considering it.</p>

            <p>Tetreault said American men who are uncircumcised
            could still practice safe sex. <span
            class="yellow">Regardless if a man is circumcised,
            condoms should always be used, she said.</span></p>

            <p>She encouraged more dialogue about topics like
            circumcision.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">"Our society doesn't look at
            human sexuality very well."</span> Tetreault said.</p>
