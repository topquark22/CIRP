            S.Africa</h2>

            <p>AFP, FRIDAY, JULY 05, 2002</p>

            <p>JOHANNESBURG: The death toll of initiates in South
            Africa following circumcisions and harsh rituals now
            stands at 14, police said on Thursday.</p>

            <p>Police spokesman Nomdumiso Jafta said seven deaths
            had been reported across Eastern Cape province over the
            past few weeks from septicaemia, negligence and natural
            causes.</p>

            <p>Another six boys have died at initiation schools or
            hospitals in Heidelberg, southeast of Johannesburg,
            over the past two weeks, and one died in northern
            Limpopo province.</p>

            <p>More than 101 boys, many with septic wounds to their
            genitals, have been treated in hospitals for multiple
            injuries after being beaten and exposed naked in
            sub-freezing temperatures at the bush schools, often
            run by unqualified teachers.</p>

            <p>Teenagers have been attending the schools since the
            beginning of June for initiation rituals, seen in many
            black cultures in South Africa as the rite of passage
            to manhood.</p>

            <p>Traditional leaders have urged that a law on
            initiation schools be drafted urgently, following a
            proliferation of fly-by-night schools.</p>
