            <h4>Tali Farkash</h4>

            <h4>Growing trend not to circumcise Jewish babies less
            worrying than fact ritual has become meaningless to
            seculars</h4>

            <p>Every once in a while the dilemma arises again, when
            a new baby is born to a secular couple. The debate
            usually opens with a text message from the exhausted
            new parents reporting that &ndash; mazal tov! &ndash; a
            healthy son was born. The aunt has already decided what
            to wear, the uncle is waiting anxiously for the call
            that would inform him of where the act, or more
            precisely &ndash; the cut &ndash; is to take place, but
            so far no word &ndash; nada.<br />
            <br />
            After waiting three days, the aunt picks up the courage
            to call the new grandma to inquire what's holding
            things back. "Is the baby okay? Does he have jaundice?"
            everything is fine, the grandmother replies, but the
            couple has decided not to circumcise the baby.<br />
            <br />
            This gives the cue for the onslaught to begin. The
            cousin who's a med student sends the parents a pile of
            studies claiming that uncircumcised babies are exposed
            to various, terrible illnesses; the aunt warns the new
            mom that the child would suffer embarrassment at the
            nursery's toilet and at the communal shower in the
            army.<br />
            <br />
            But the new parents insist: Yes to a party, but no to a
            brit.<br />
            <br />
            Honestly? It's about time. Just like any other Jewish
            act &ndash; namely a mitzvah, and what&rsquo;s more a
            mitzvah that involves inflicting pain on a helpless
            eight-day-old baby &ndash; the brit milah has also arrived
            at a crossroads. And against all criticism and warnings,
            the decision to give it a pass is becoming increasingly
            trendy in Israel.</p>

            <h5>Circumcision for all the wrong reasons</h5>

            <p>"I've managed to stand up to the religious,
            overbearing establishment," is an old, familiar motto.
            Only this time, instead of getting married in Cyprus or
            holding a non-religious funeral at a kibbutz, we've
            decided to keep the boy in one piece, without
            performing "barbaric" incisions in his body. What's
            wrong with that? We have here caring, well-informed
            parents who are unwilling to swallow every nonsensical
            argument that an over-zealous circumciser tries to
            shove down their throat at the neonatal ward.<br />
            <br />
            And even I, a mitzvah observing person, don't have a
            problem with the ever-rising number of uncircumcised
            Israelis. It is beyond my powers to try and explain to
            people how much this ritual is imbued with meaning and
            speak poetically about its spiritual virtues. I don't
            see myself preaching against the dangerous decline of
            Jewish values over the Knesset podium, like many
            religious MKs.<br />
            <br />
            Unfortunately the bottom line is that it doesn't matter
            whether the boy was circumcised due to health concerns
            or because his parents wanted to make sure he'd fit in
            with the other kids in kindergarten. The moment that
            the brit has been taken out of its religious context
            and became a social act that declares one's belonging
            to a group, instead of a covenant between God and his
            children, it has lost its true and appropriate role
            &ndash; at least in my view.<br />
            <br />
             I am much more concerned by the fact that many in
            Israel feel that their Jewishness is an unwelcomed
            burden - a redundant, meaningless piece of information.
            Just a trick of the universe that has landed them in
            the bosom of an ancient, long-suffering nation. They
            therefore choose to have the brit without ceremony, or
            blessings or a minyan. Just make the cut and get it
            over with, much like the many who choose not to
            circumcise their sons at all. And it is indeed a
            circumcision, but certainly not a brit &ndash; a
            covenant.<br />
            <br />
             Choosing not to perform the brit ceremony (with or
            without circumcision) is a natural symptom for the
            alienation from the ritual's true purpose. From this
            standpoint it becomes very easy to decide to give the
            thing up entirely, because "there is no covenant
            between me and anyone up there." Sadly, no shiny party
            with a buffet, jamboree and a famous circumciser could
            stitch together this spiritual cut.<br />
            <br />
            And if you ask me, this is the cut that hurts the
            most.</p>
