            <h2>Sudan's Slaves</h2>
            By Michael Coren<br />
             Sun Media | November 25, 2003 

            <p>Women and children abducted in slave raids are roped
            by the neck or strapped to animals and then marched
            north. Along the way, many women and girls are
            repeatedly gang-raped. Children who will not be silent
            are shot on the spot. In the north, slaves are either
            kept by individual militia soldiers or sold in markets.
            Boys work as livestock herders, forced to sleep with
            the animals they care for.</p>

            <p>"Some who try to escape have their Achilles tendons
            cut to hamper their ability to run. Masters typically
            use women and girls as domestics and concubines,
            cleaning by day and serving the master sexually by
            night. Survivors report being called "Abeed" (black
            slave), enduring daily beatings, and receiving awful
            food. Masters also strip slaves of their religious and
            cultural identities, giving them Arabic names and
            forcing them to pray as Muslims."</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Thus says one leading slavery
            abolitionist group. A former slave writes of "the rape
            of girls and boys alike, the forced circumcision of
            boys and girls, often with them fully conscious and
            screaming and having to be held down by many people.
            Sodomy and sadistic torture are common. Living
            hell."</span></p>

            <p>Another says. "Families were broken up, with
            children sometimes murdered in front of their mothers
            as a warning and because they were too much trouble. We
            cried out to the West, to the countries who said they
            believed in human rights, but they were indifferent to
            our agony."</p>

            <p>Thank goodness, of course, that this is the stuff of
            a dark history that can now be comfortably condemned in
            the privilege of a civilized and complacent modernity.
            Oh, what awful times they were.</p>

            <p>Problem is, it's not some description of the ancient
            world or an example of the worst excesses of American
            slavery in the early 19th century. No, it's happening
            right now, and some of those who have escaped this evil
            have found sanctuary in Canada. They are willing to
            tell their stories, if anyone will listen.</p>

            <p>This is the reality of Sudan, a country with which
            Ottawa has good relations and a nation that is accepted
            in every major international organization, where it
            regularly votes to condemn liberal democracies. Because
            it possesses oil, many foreign governments who scream
            freedom seem to become deaf and dumb about the
            obscenity of slavery.</p>

            <p>There has been a civil war going on in Sudan for
            years, and after years of pain and struggle a peace
            treaty has been signed between the Islamic government
            in Khartoum and the black, largely Christian groups in
            the south. A referendum has been guaranteed to decide
            whether the south wants independence.</p>

            <p>The "yes" vote would be almost unanimous, but the
            Arab rulers in the north have enforced a waiting period
            of several years until this plebiscite can take
            place.</p>

            <p>One can only imagine what they will try to do in the
            time they have left.</p>

            <p>They are backed by many Muslim groups and
            governments the world over and even have supporters in
            Canada. Major newspapers have featured articles denying
            that slavery exists in Sudan. It is almost akin to
            Holocaust denial in its vile spirit. Then again,
            several Muslim states bathe in those stagnant and
            infected waters these days.</p>

            <p>This horror has taken place for two major reasons.
            The people of southern Sudan are black, and they are
            not Muslim. At a time when we hear so much about
            Islam's treatment by the world, we ought to consider
            that one of the greatest crimes of this generation has
            been committed by a Muslim fundamentalist government
            and army against a black and Christian people who want
            only their dignity.</p>

            <p>In fact, millions have been enslaved, murdered,
            mutilated and abused in this campaign, far more than
            have suffered in, for example, what are known as the
            Occupied Territories in Israel. Odd, then, that so much
            media time is given to that situation, so little to
            this.</p>

            <p>The world ought to look closely at what takes place
            in Sudan in the months and years to come. There are
            very powerful and very bad people who will resist
            ceaselessly the creation of a separate African and
            largely Christian state on the edge of the House of
            Islam.</p>

            <p>Let us hope the world does not play the role of
            hypocrite once again. The stench of the blood is
            becoming overwhelming.</p>
