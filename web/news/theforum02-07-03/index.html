            <p>The Forum - 02/07/2003</p>

            <p>When <a href="http://www.zbaer.com/anita.htm"
            target="_blank">Anita Flatt</a> gave birth to her son
            at <a href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Hospital</a> five years ago,
            she hadn't slept all day.</p>

            <p>There were complications.</p>

            <p>Her water wouldn't break and had to be pierced
            manually. She was put on pain medication, but it wasn't
            helping.</p>

            <p>Then, with her doctor out of the room, she screamed.
            Nurses rushed in and delivered her son.</p>

            <p>Later on March 6, 1997, Flatt signed a consent form
            to have her son circumcised, she told a jury Thursday
            in <a href="http://www.co.cass.nd.us/"
            target="_blank">Cass County</a> District Court.</p>

            <p>Flatt of <a href="http://www.hawley.govoffice.com/"
            target="_blank">Hawley</a>, Minn., is suing <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734"
             target="_blank">Dr. Sunita Kantak</a> and <a
            href="http://www.ci.fargo.nd.us/visitor.htm"
            target="_blank">Fargo</a>-based <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Hospital</a> claiming she and
            her husband, James, weren't told complete and accurate
            information about removing the foreskin from their
            son's penis.</p>

            <p>Flatt told the jury Thursday she had not received
            any information prior to her son's birth about the
            risks and benefits of circumcision.</p>

            <p>She says she never received the booklet MeritCare
            gives out to parents, and only talked to Kantak briefly
            about the pain involved before the procedure was
            performed.</p>

            <p>Had Flatt understood the risks involved in the
            procedure, she wouldn't have had it done, she said.</p>

            <p>Attorney <a href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a> started his examination
            by asking Flatt why she had filed the lawsuit.</p>

            <p>"He was subjected to an unnecessary surgery and he
            was harmed and he has an injury," Flatt, an attorney at
            Baer's law firm, told the jury.</p>

            <p>That injury, she claims, is the <a
            href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">loss of a healthy and
            functional foreskin</a>.</p>

            <p>The trial, which enters day five today, recessed
            with Baer still examining Flatt.</p>

            <p>Most of the focus Thursday was on the plaintiff's
            other two witnesses, <a
            href="http://www.marshfieldclinic.org/provider/detail.asp?ID=32941"
             target="_blank">Drs. Christopher Cold</a> of <a
            href="http://www.wisinfo.com/newsherald/realestate/community/profile.shtml"
             target="_blank">Marshfield</a>, Wis., and <a
            href="http://www.mgh.org/directry/docmgh/vanhowr1.html"
            target="_blank">Robert Van Howe</a> of <a
            href="http://www.mqtcty.org/"
            target="_blank">Marquette</a>, Mich.</p>

            <p>After three days of listening to them speak on the
            benefits of foreskin and barbarity of circumcision,
            defense attorneys <a
            href="http://www.vogellaw.com/fsl5cs/XMLAttorneyProfile.asp?guid=I1D0AB9301DD211B28BAB4D00E205CACF&amp;ind_wld_id=1286278"
             target="_blank">Jane Voglewede</a> and <a
            href="http://www.vogellaw.com/fsl5cs/XMLAttorneyProfile.asp?guid=I30B624CE1DD211B2A40BB0001207C554&amp;ind_wld_id=3185802"
             target="_blank">Angela Lord</a> got their chance to
            cross-examine.</p>

            <p>Both men admitted they are morally against infant
            circumcision, are not licensed to perform circumcision,
            aren't involved in getting patient informed consent for
            circumcision and have financially supported
            anti-circumcision groups.</p>

            <p>The exchanges between witnesses and defense
            attorneys were at times sharp.</p>

            <p>When Cold, whose answers to Baer's questions at
            times resembled classroom lectures, tried to answer a
            yes-no question with another question, Lord cut him
            short.</p>

            <p>"I'll ask the questions," she said.</p>

            <p>Voglewede showed the jury a letter Baer had written
            to Van Howe in 1998.</p>

            <p>It included the medical records of Flatt's child and
            asked if he thought there was the potential for a
            lawsuit.</p>

            <p>In his response, Van Howe said he thought it would
            be very "difficult to demonstrate that (Flatt's son)
            has been harmed in any way."</p>

            <p>Baer later said the letter did not specifically
            address the informed consent issue.</p>

            <p>Flatt is asking for an unspecified amount in
            damages.</p>

            <p>MeritCare officials left the courtroom without
            comment.</p>

            <p>The trial is expected to conclude next week. <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/COURT/DISTRICTS/EC.HTM"
             target="_blank">East Central District Court</a> <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/Rothe-Seeger.htm"
             target="_blank">Judge Cynthia Rothe-Seeger</a> is
            presiding over the case.</p>

            <p>"They are trying to portray it as a cabal that is
            opposed to circumcision," Baer said following the
            trial. "All we are trying to do is to protect those who
            cannot protect themselves, to keep them in tact so they
            are not abused in a ritualistic way."</p>
