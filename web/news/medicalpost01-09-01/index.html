      <h2>Weighing the foreskin's value</h2>

      <h4>New studies suggest the foreskin is more sexually
      important than once thought</h4>
      By <b>Celia Milne</b> 

      <p>Just when you thought nothing new could be said about the
      foreskin, two new studies, one in Canada and one in Britain,
      support the idea that doctors shouldn't be too hasty in
      recommending its removal.</p>

      <p>The as-yet-unpublished Canadian study looked at the
      function of the foreskin and found the tissue to be much more
      important sexually than previously thought. The <a
      href="http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/321/7264/792"
      target="_blank">British study</a>, meantime, found too many
      English boys are still being circumcised because of
      difficulties retracting the foreskin.</p>

      <p>First, the Canadian study. Inside the foreskin, a band of
      tissue has been discovered that expands and contracts like an
      accordion during erection and intercourse, triggering sexual
      reflexes.</p>

      <p>"It has a lot to do with sexual satisfaction and broader
      implications about fertility," said Dr. John R. Taylor, a
      retired pathologist in Winnipeg and lead researcher in the
      new study.</p>

      <p>Dr. Taylor and his colleagues were probably the first in
      modern times to seriously investigate the anatomy of the
      foreskin. "Descriptions of the foreskin in all the anatomy
      books read by medical students and nurses are much the same
      as 300 years ago," said Dr. Taylor.</p>

      <p>In 1996, he and his colleagues published in the British
      Journal of Urology <a href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">results
      of a detailed study of 21 adult foreskins</a> at autopsy. "No
      one could believe there was anything new in anatomy. I
      couldn't believe what I was seeing," said Dr. Taylor in a
      phone interview.</p>

      <p>What they found, and named, was the "ridged band"-unique
      tissue about half an inch wide that runs around the inside
      tip of the foreskin.</p>

      <p>"The foreskin is not just a piece of skin, but specialized
      tissue full of blood vessels and nerves," he said.</p>

      <p>He now wants to get the message out to doctors and
      patients that circumcision takes away something important.
      "Circumcision always removes a large sexually significant
      portion of the penis."</p>

      <p>Dr. Aaron Jesin, a Toronto physician and mohel who
      performs both non-ritual circumcisions in his clinic and
      Jewish ritual circumcisions in people's homes, is not sold on
      the sexual attributes of the foreskin. "To me, it is a
      difficult argument to prove," he said. "Jewish people have
      lots of sex and lots of kids."</p>

      <p>Besides, he said, how can it ever be studied, whether sex
      is better with the foreskin intact. "How do they know? It
      would be hard to put together a big enough study."</p>

      <p>Dr. Taylor has been accused of being anti-Semitic because
      he is vocal about the downside of circumcision. But he has no
      argument against circumcision done for religious reasons. It
      has been done routinely in Jewish and Muslim boys since
      ancient times when, it is believed, God commanded Abraham to
      have his offspring circumcised.</p>

      <p>"Circumcision is done in the Jewish faith for good, sound
      religious reaons," said Dr. Taylor, "and they realize it is a
      significant sacrifice." His message is directed more at
      people who aren't sure what to do.</p>

      <p>Beyond the newborn stage, parents often look to doctors
      for help when their growing boy's foreskin isn't retracting.
      Which brings us to the British study.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/321/7264/792"
      target="_blank">study</a>, published in the September 2000
      issue of the British Medical Journal, looked at circumcision
      rates and concluded too many English boys were still being
      circumcised because of a misdiagnosis of phimosis. Phimosis
      almost always resolves as boys mature, it said. Only 0.6% of
      boys with phimosis actually require circumcision, and those
      are the ones with secondary cicatrisation of the orifice.</p>

      <p>For the others, there are alternatives to try-for
      instance, topical steroids. A group of pediatric urologists
      in Barcelona found them to be an effective treatment for
      phimosis. Their <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/orsola1/">study</a> of 137
      boys with phimosis (median age five) was published in the
      August 2000 issue Urology. The study found that six months
      after initial treatment with topical steroids, 90% of the
      boys had developed an easily retractable prepuce; for the
      others, compliance had been the main problem.</p>

      <p>Dr. Paul Munk, a pediatrician in Toronto, has a <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/beauge/">low-tech
      prescription</a> to mend a tight foreskin. "Time, patience
      and basic hygiene"... as well as letting the child
      masturbate. "Phimosis does happen occasionally," he
      explained, "but by the late teens the tissue usually
      stretches and the adhesion is released."</p>

      <p>A laissez-faire attitude toward the foreskin is starting
      to catch on in many parts of the world. In Canada, the <a
      href="/library/statistics/Canada/">circumcision rate</a> is
      dropping. It now hovers around 20%, still high compared to
      England's approximately 4% and Scandinavia's 2%. The U.S.
      rate of infant circumcision is much higher at about 63%.</p>

      <p>In some countries where men are at high risk for HIV
      infection, such as in some African countries, circumcision is
      being floated as a preventive measure. A growing body of
      evidence supports the conclusion that circumcised men are at
      reduced risk of HIV infection, possibly by as much as 50%. In
      a study recently published in the journal AIDS, for instance,
      it was found circumcision was associated with a reduced rate
      of acquiring HIV infection among the study population of
      5,507 Ugandan men.</p>

      <p>The strong beneficial effect of circumcision, however, may
      be confounded by other factors. Most of the circumcised men
      in the study were Muslim, so researchers need to find out
      whether other practices of Muslims are significant
      factors.</p>

      <p>At the moment, most experts agree it is premature to
      recommend mass circumcision in high-risk populations, though
      plenty of editorials in the literature have called for just
      that.</p>

      <p>For every pro-circumcision argument, there is a
      counterview. For instance, another of the advantages of
      circumcision is that it reduces to almost nil the chance of
      developing cancer of the penis, though Dr. Jesin admitted
      this cancer is very rare. Besides, said Dennis Harrison, an
      anti-circumcision activist in Vancouver, "There are medical
      benefits to removing almost any part of the body. Cut off a
      toe and you don't get nail fungus."</p>

      <p>A third advantage to circumcision is a reduction in
      urinary tract infections in babies. A study published in the
      April 2000 edition of Pediatrics concluded that newborn
      circumcision results in a nine-fold decrease in the incidence
      of UTIs in a baby's first year and that circumcision is "a
      valuable preventive health measure, particularly in the first
      three months of life." However, said Dr. Taylor, it is short-
      sighted for parents to make a decision on that basis. "It is
      important in circumcision decisions to think well ahead, say,
      20 years," he argued.</p>

      <p>Here in Canada, circumcision has been ruled not medically
      justified. A <a
      href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm"
      target="_blank">position statement on circumcision</a>,
      released in 1996 by the Canadian Pediatric Society and
      reaffirmed this year, recommended that circumcision of
      newborns should not be routinely performed. "The overall
      evidence of the benefits and harms of circumcision is so
      evenly balanced that it does not support recommending
      circumcision as a routine procedure for newborns."</p>

      <p>Dr. Munk called circumcision "cosmetic surgery" because it
      is often done so boys can look like their fathers, and it is
      almost always privately paid for. (Manitoba is the only
      province where the procedure is covered under provincial
      insurance.)</p>

      <p>Circumcision is also an ethical and legal hot potato.
      "People have a fundamental human right not to have pain
      intentionally inflicted on them," writes <a
      href="http://www.mcgill.ca/public/releases/2000/november/somerville/"
       target="_blank">Margaret Somerville</a> in her new book, <a
      href="/library/ethics/somerville4/">The Ethical Canary</a>.
      Dr. Somerville, a lawyer and ethicist at <a
      href="http://www.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank">McGill
      University</a>, is well-known for her anti-circumcision
      views. Legally, she explained, there may be a way to prohibit
      infant male circumcision while respecting religious reasons
      for doing it.</p>

      <p>If Dr. Taylor has his say, doctors giving advice to
      parents who sit on the fence will start with the premise that
      the foreskin is a valuable part of their son's body. "In the
      equation, the value of the actual foreskin is often put at
      zero," he said. "Put a value on it. It is a structure in its
      own right."</p>
