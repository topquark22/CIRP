            <p>Johannesburg - A sixth initiate from a school in the
            Ratanda, Heidelberg, area died on Monday, according to
            news reports.</p>

            <p>Papa Mbovane (19) reportedly died of internal
            injuries at Heidelberg Hospital after he had been
            returned to an initiation school by his family on
            Wednesday last week. He had been removed from the
            school the day before.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Gauteng police searched in vain for a
            missing initiate in Heidelberg on Monday.</p>

            <p>Heidelberg detective services chief, Superintendent
            Roy Fry, said the eight-hour search was called off
            after it delivered nothing.</p>

            <p>Police earlier feared that another initiate had died
            after a youth escaped from a camp on Sunday night and
            claimed <a href="/news/thestar06-30-02/"
            target="_blank">he woke up next to a dead
            initiate</a>.</p>

            <p>The boy did not go along when the police went to the
            camp to investigate and has since disappeared.</p>

            <p>Fry said a search-and-rescue dog squad and police
            divers backed up by a helicopter combed the area for
            hours on Monday before concluding there was no
            body.</p>

            <p>Gauteng health spokesperson Simon Zwane said the
            department also visited the area on Monday, but could
            not find any new unregistered initiation schools.</p>

            <p>Charges were also dropped against an initiation
            school teacher arrested last week.</p>
