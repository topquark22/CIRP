            <p>Emma Swain<br />
            Wednesday, 2 April 2003</p>

            <p class="text"><a
            href="http://www.hunter.health.nsw.gov.au/"
            target="_blank">Hunter Health</a> has ceased routine
            neonatal circumcision within its hospitals following a
            <a href="http://www.racp.edu.au">Royal Australasian
            College of Physicians</a> recommendation.</p>

            <p class="text">In its position statement on
            circumcision, the college stated that it had revised
            its <a
            href="http://www.racp.edu.au/hpu/paed/circumcision/"
            target="_blank">policy</a> following 'critical
            literature analysis' by a working party of
            representatives from a number of professional
            organisations including paediatricians, paediatric
            surgeons, general surgeons and urologists from
            Australia and New Zealand.</p>

            <p class="text">The Royal Australasian College of
            Physicians' division of paediatrics and child health
            has concluded that where no medical indication for
            circumcision exists, the procedure is best performed
            under general anaesthetic after the age of six months
            to reduce the risks and the discomfort for the
            child.</p>

            <p class="text">Until recently, circumcision of newborn
            baby boys was available at Cessnock and Belmont
            hospitals.</p>

            <p class="text">Hunter Health Area director of child
            health services professor Trish Davidson said about 250
            babies were circumcised in the Hunter each year and the
            majority of these babies were aged under six months and
            were performed for social rather than medical
            reasons.</p>

            <p class="text"><span class="yellow">"Following the
            College of Physicians' declaration, we have acted
            quickly and prudently to stop newborn circumcisions in
            Hunter public hospitals," professor Davidson
            said.</span></p>

            <p class="text">"There are some individuals and
            cultures who favour the circumcision of male babies and
            the procedure is still available for babies more than
            six months old. Parents need to ask their GP for a
            referral to an appropriate surgeon."</p>

            <p class="text">While some health benefits have been
            claimed for circumcision, this review of the literature
            shows no evidence of benefits outweighing harm for
            circumcision as a routine procedure.</p>

            <p class="text">The complication rate of neonatal
            circumcision is reported to be about one per cent to
            five per cent and ranges from minor bleeding and
            infection to damage to the genitalia or, rarely,
            septicaemia or even death.</p>
