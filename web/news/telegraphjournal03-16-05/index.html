            <p>BY DERWIN GOWAN<br />
             Telegraph-Journal</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.cpsnb.org/"
            target="_blank">College and Physicians and Surgeons of
            New Brunswick</a> will revisit the issue of
            circumcising infant males.</p>

            <p>An item on the college's website says it received a
            request to take another look at the matter after the <a
            href="https://www.cpsbc.ca/" target="_blank">British
            Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons</a>
            published new guidelines.</p>

            <p>The British Columbia college issued its <a
            href="https://www.cpsbc.ca/cps/physician_resources/publications/resource_manual/malecircum"
             target="_blank">new policy</a> last year following a
            <a
            href="http://www.circumstitions.com/death-exsang.html"
            target="_blank">coroner's report</a> on the death of
            five-week-old Ryleigh Roman McWillis, <a
            href="/news/theprovince08-29-02/">who bled to death
            following the operation</a> in Penticton, B.C., in
            August 2002.</p>

            <p>Dr. Ed Schollenberg, registrar of New Brunswick
            college, which regulates medical practice in the
            province, says the college's council didn't like the
            wording of the new British Columbia policy.</p>

            <p>He said the New Brunswick college will await the
            outcome of a review by the <a href="http://www.cps.ca/"
            target="_blank">Canadian Paediatric Society</a>.</p>

            <p>In the meantime, New Brunswick will stick with
            society's current policy in place since 1996.</p>

            <p>Pending the outcome of its current review, the
            national paediatric society recommends against
            routinely circumcising male infants.</p>

            <p>"The overall evidence of the benefits and harms of
            circumcision is so evenly balanced it does not support
            recommending circumcision as a routine procedure for
            newborns," says the current national guideline.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>"When parents are making a decision about
              circumcision, they should be advised of the present
              state of medical knowledge about its benefits and
              harms. The decision may ultimately be based on
              personal, religious, or cultural factors."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The New Brunswick college noted "several valuable
            comments" in the new British Columbia <a
            href="https://www.cpsbc.ca/cps/physician_resources/publications/resource_manual/malecircum"
             target="_blank">policy</a>, particularly the
            suggestion to require clear informed consent from both
            parents.</p>

            <p>The new British Columbia policy states that infant
            male circumcision is "assumed to be legal if it is
            performed competently, in the child's best interest,
            and after valid consent has been obtained."</p>

            <p>However, the British Columbia guideline states that
            circumcising baby boys for non-medical reasons presents
            ethical and human rights concerns, and that "parental
            preference alone" does not justify non-therapeutic
            intervention.</p>

            <p>"You are not obliged to act upon a request to
            circumcise an infant, but you must discuss the medical
            evidence and the current thoughts in bioethics that
            dissuade you from performing this procedure. You must
            also inform the parents that they have the right to see
            another doctor."</p>

            <p>"We weren't particularly fond of the way they worded
            their policy," Dr. Schollenberg said, describing the
            British Columbia document as too "philosophical" and
            "ambiguous" with not enough practical advice for
            practising doctors.</p>

            <p>So, New Brunswick will stick with the Canadian
            Pediatric Society <a
            href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm"
             target="_blank">guideline</a> pending further
            review.</p>

            <p>"Our policy has tended to be to look to these
            national bodies . . . they're smart people, they tend
            to be a little less politically involved," Dr.
            Schollenberg said.</p>

            <p>He said circumcising infant boys for non-medical
            reasons was already falling out of fashion at the time
            that he wound up his own paediatric practice in
            Winnipeg in 1987.</p>

            <p>"It's dropped and dropped and dropped over the years
            . . . it used to be a medically insured service," he
            said.</p>

            <p>Dennis Harrison, spokesman for the <a
            href="http://www.courtchallenge.com/"
            target="_blank">Association for Genital Integrity</a>,
            a Canadian anti-circumcision lobby group, agreed in a
            telephone interview from Vancouver that the rate of
            non-therapeutic infant male circumcision is dropping in
            Canada - from 16.9 per cent of males born in Canada in
            1999 to 13.9 per cent in 2003.</p>

            <p>However, he said the national figures hide regional
            anomalies, especially on the East Coast.</p>

            <p>Citing <a
            href="http://www.courtchallenge.com/refs/yr99p-e.html"
            target="_blank">numbers</a> from the association's
            website, he said that in the most recent fiscal year,
            14.9 per cent of male New Brunswick newborns went under
            the knife compared to only 1.1 per cent in Nova
            Scotia.</p>

            <p>The contrast widens in the rest of Atlantic Canada:
            29.5 per cent on Prince Edward Island, none in
            Newfoundland and Labrador. The Quebec rate was 3.2 per
            cent.</p>

            <p>Dr. Schollenberg questions these figures.</p>

            <p>New Brunswick Medicare stopped paying for routine
            infant circumcision on Sept. 15, 1994, and Nova Scotia
            on Jan. 20, 1997. Dr. Schollenberg, questioned who is
            counting with no Medicare billing statistics.</p>

            <p>Mr. Harrison said the <a
            href="http://www.gnb.ca/0051/index-e.asp"
            target="_blank">Department of Health and Wellness</a>
            provided the New Brunswick numbers.</p>

            <p>The Nova Scotia data came from the <a
            href="http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/splash.html"
            target="_blank">Canadian Institute for Health
            Information</a> Discharge Abstract Database.</p>

            <p>Mr. Harrison said about 60 per cent of newborn
            American baby boys are circumcised. The average is in
            the 30% range in California but as high as 90 per cent
            in some midwestern states.</p>

            <p>"When it comes down to it, this is incredibly
            cultural . . . there're always differences from one
            place to another," Dr. Schollenberg said.</p>

            <p>"Social conformity seems to be at the root of it . .
            . studies have shown that the major factor is the
            attitude of the doctors," Mr. Harrison said.</p>

            <p>"At the end of the day, this is not an issue that
            has come from anyone local having a problem," Dr.
            Schollenberg said, referring to the New Brunswick
            review. "Just realize that you're dealing with a
            cultural issue, not a medical one."</p>
