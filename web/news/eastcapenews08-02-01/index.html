      <p>Parents searching for their sons who had gone to be
      circumcised finally found them in hospital and the government
      was appealling to families to get involved in the process to
      avoid this and other shocking practises, said <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/structure/department/health2/overview.htm">
      Health department</a> spokesperson Mahlubandile Mageda today.
      (subs: Thurs).</p>

      <p>Getting involved would also to curb the death and
      mutilation rate.</p>

      <p>He said: "Some parents don't know where their boys are.
      After a month they find out they're in hospital," said
      Mageda. What was happening in some areas was "a great shock".
      "I know it is a problem. We want to cap it. If we can control
      that (initiation) we will succeed in so many areas of health
      care." "You have an 11-year-old being circumcised. Where does
      that come from? That is not circumcision."</p>

      <p>Libode was a particularly bad area. "Circumcision was
      never done there previously, now everyone is being
      circumcised." "We have some guys in custody for sending boys
      out to steal a chicken in return for circumcision."</p>

      <p>"There are uncircumcised men pretending to be incgibi."
      "Thats why the Kings must be involved so they know who is
      working as an ingcibi in their area. All stake holders must
      be involved." The department was breaking new ground in
      gathering information around the initiation custom.</p>

      <p>"We are examining issues in order to develop a programme.
      There is a broad network gathering information."</p>

      <p>"Health investigators are working with local communities
      and councils, trying to get all stakeholders involved."
      "Workshops have been happening. Health investigators have
      been going to schools and conducting workshops in an effort
      to educate communities."</p>

      <p>Regarding the number of young men who returned home
      mutilated he said the department appealed to all health
      institutions to give them the best possible care they
      could.</p>

      <p>"We are really (just) starting. We need to examine the
      psychological affects of mutilation and develop a means to
      counsel them." However, he was positive that progress was
      being made. "We are better off now than we were last year or
      the year before."</p>
