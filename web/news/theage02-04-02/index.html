    <h2><font face="arial">Doctor before board over penis
    surgery</font></h2>

      size="2">Monday 4 February 2002</font></p>

      <p>A Melbourne doctor allegedly performed surgery on his
      37-year-old patient's penis without consent, telling him
      circumcision would bring him success with women, a hearing
      was told today.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.mpbofv.org.au/">Medical
      Practitioners Board of Victoria</a> is investigating Dr
      Christopher Towie for professional misconduct during a single
      consultation at a Broadmeadows clinic in May 2000.</p>

      <p>During the consultation, which went for longer than
      normal, Dr Towie allegedly told the man, now 39, that the top
      part of his foreskin was the source of his problems with
      women.</p>

      <p>A notice of the allegations being considered by the board
      hearing today reads: "You told your patient that circumcision
      would help get him girls by making his penis appear
      bigger."</p>

      <p>The precise extent of the "surgical procedure" carried out
      by the general practitioner was not revealed before the
      hearing was closed.</p>

      <p>Dr Towie allegedly interrupted the consultation to attend
      another patient, leaving the man with his "pants down and
      sexually aroused" before giving him some cream and telling
      him to masturbate.</p>

      <p>He is also accused of telling his patient that his history
      of self mutilation was normal and offering to send him to
      "places where S and M leather things happen" or organising "a
      girl for the purposes of sex".</p>

      <p>The hearing continues in camera.</p>
