            Mutilation?</h2>

            <h4>Legislation could change the future of American
            males.</h4>

            <p>(SAN DIEGO, Calif.) - Circumcision is flying to the
            front of medical and political arguments as Americans
            face the idea that we as a society may be gravely in
            error in our choice to allow doctors to complete
            circumcisions of young boys, particularly those just
            born which is the common approach in most cases.<br />
            <br />
             Experts on both sides of the argument are esteemed
            researchers, but a closer look at what circumcision
            really brings us; campaigns for Viagra and a lack of
            sexual satisfaction in men, shows that it may be among
            our worst and most cruel cultural practices.<br />
            <br />
             Talk about a subject that takes people out of their
            comfort zone. It is hard to learn that your life is not
            what it was really meant to be, that everything about
            our sexual lives is impacted by the fact that part of
            us was cut off and tossed when we were infants, without
            a voice to complain.<br />
            <br />
             Now the movement is stepping forward with legislation
            that would curb or end the practice in our hospitals.
            The MGM Bill to End Male Genital Mutilation in the U.S.
            could change the way our society treats its young
            boys.<br />
            <br />
             "The legislation that we are proposing would give boys
            the same protection from genital cutting that girls
            have enjoyed since 1997," said Matthew Hess, the
            group&rsquo;s president. "Circumcision removes
            erogenous tissue in both sexes and results in a
            measurable loss of sexual feeling. It is a traumatic
            and disfiguring surgery that should not be performed on
            children unless there is a clear, compelling, and
            immediate medical need &ndash; period."<br />
            <br />
             Hess says genital cutting of girls has been prohibited
            in the U.S. since 1997 when the Female Genital
            Mutilation Act took effect, requiring women to be
            eighteen years old before consenting to any type of
            genital surgery. The law has been credited with helping
            to keep forced female circumcision from spreading to
            the U.S. from Africa and the Middle East, where it is
            much more common.<br />
            <br />
             Boys were not included in the law, however, and as a
            result circumcision is still performed on nearly 60% of
            U.S. newborn males by physicians, religious
            practitioners, or family members.<br />
            <br />
             A Frankfurt, Germany, regional appeals court pushed
            circumcision further into the legal gray area recently
            when it found that the circumcision of an 11-year-old
            Muslim boy without his approval was an unlawful
            personal injury. And in November, the Oregon Supreme
            Court heard a case filed by the mother of a 12-year-old
            boy trying to protect him from being circumcised by his
            father for religious reasons. (Oregon Courts Have No
            Right to Force Circumcision) The court&rsquo;s decision
            on the Oregon case is pending.<br />
            <br />
             Anti-circumcision advocates say the latest blow comes
            from a Johns Hopkins University report that suggests
            men who are circumcised are at less risk of contracting
            the AID's virus. People who have studied the subject
            for years, like Marylin Milos in San Francisco with the
            National Organization of Circumcision Information
            Resource Centers, call the information into question
            and believe it is a death sentence for many.<br />
            <br />
             "People aren't going to stop getting AID's because
            they're circumcised. This gives false hope and it isn't
            responsible information for medical professionals to be
            putting out there."<br />
            <br />
             It does seem like an overly optimistic thought to
            suggest that a man could have unprotected sex with a
            person who has AID's without protection and somehow
            avoid getting sick because his foreskin is
            removed.<br />
            <br />
             The conservative press group Voices of America
            published the article about circumcision and AID's
            yesterday, this is the opening paragraph:<br />
            <br />
             "<i>Epidemiologist Ronald Gray from the Johns Hopkins
            School of Public Health led the original studies
            looking at circumcision and HIV risk. In order to
            convince skeptical men, he says they needed to know if
            men would be willing to be circumcised and what it
            would do to sexual performance and
            satisfaction.</i>"<br />
            <br />
             Perhaps the word "<i>convince</i>" says it all.
            Doctors make money from circumcising young male
            children.<br />
            <br />
             If you jump past the Biblical origination of the story
            and flash forward about 1850 years, you learn that
            Jewish people were actually scorned for their
            circumcisions in most western societies. But then a
            belief developed in England that circumcising boys
            would reduce masturbation. That is all it took, along
            with the money the practice represents for European and
            American doctors and hospitals.<br />
            <br />
             Marylin Milos cites other developments over the years
            including locker room phobia, largely eliminated now as
            most west coast states are shying away from forcing
            young students to disrobe in front of one
            another.<br />
            <br />
             This practice according to Milos, reduces the feeling
            that men experience during sex. That diminished quality
            has lifetime implications. She says it is that
            diminished feeling that leads to men seeking cures for
            erectile dysfunction.<br />
            <br />
             She says pro-circumcision advocates also released
            through medical journals decades ago, a connection
            between uncircumcised men and penile cancer, which was
            proven to be false information. Instead, she says that
            in the case of many circumcised men who contract penile
            cancer, it begins at their circumcision scar.<br />
            <br />
             This is a subject just gaining momentum in this
            country and it isn't likely to lose steam as parents
            and others become increasingly aware of a number of
            problems associated with the practice. The online
            dictionary Wikipedia clearly defines the practice of
            circumcision as mutilation.<br />
            <br />
             Wikipedia states, "Mutilation is an act or physical
            injury that degrades the appearance or function of the
            (human) body, usually without causing death."
            Circumcision is listed alongside burning and
            amputation, as a form of mutilation or maiming.</p>
