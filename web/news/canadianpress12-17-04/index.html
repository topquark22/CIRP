            circumcision</h2>
            Canadian Press 

            <p><i>Friday, December 17, 2004</i></p>

            <p>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) - The Dutch national
            health insurance will no longer pay for male
            circumcision, the Heath Ministry said Friday.</p>

            <p>The ministry decided to halt compensation following
            reports that up to 90 per cent of circumcisions are
            carried out for religious, rather than health reasons,
            as specified in Dutch law, ministry spokesman Bas Kuik
            said.</p>

            <p>Muslims and Jews routinely circumcise boys at birth.
            Around 8.5 per cent of children born in the Netherlands
            are circumcised, or about 17,000 a year. The average
            cost at birth, when there are no complications, is
            around $650 Cdn.</p>

            <p>Female circumcision - sometimes called genital
            mutilation - is outlawed in the Netherlands, and the
            government plans a law making it possible to prosecute
            parents who travel to foreign countries to have their
            daughters circumcised.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/radionetherlands10-07-04/">
            Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner said in October the
            government has no plans to outlaw male
            circumcision</a>, which is classified as a cosmetic
            surgery if not medically necessary.</p>
