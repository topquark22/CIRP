            <h2>Finland Considers Legalising Male Circumcision</h2>

            <p><br />
            <br />
             <b>Finland is considering legalising the practice of
            male circumcision. <a
            href="http://www.stm.fi/Resource.phx/eng/index.htx"
            target="_blank">The Ministry of Social Affairs and
            Health</a> is currently preparing draft legislation,
            which would make circumcision acceptable when performed
            by a doctor, according to the parents' wishes, and with
            the child's consent.</b><br />
            <br />
             According to the bill, parents can choose to perform
            the procedure on behalf of a small child. However
            difficulties may arise in cases where one parent
            opposes the circumcision. Officials hope to bring the
            bill before Parliament as early as this year.<br />
            <br />
             In Finland circumcisions are carried out for religious
            purposes by members of the Jewish, Muslim and Tartar
            communities. Estimates are that currently about 100
            operations are performed annually.<br />
            <br />
             <b>Police Investigate Two Circumcision Cases</b><br />
            <br />
             Currently the law on male circumcision is somewhat
            hazy. Information about circumcisions is passed on to
            police for further investigation. Police enquiries have
            put an end to some attempts to carry out circumcisions,
            since the procedure is treated as serious abuse.<br />
            <br />
             <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/helsinginsanomat2006-08-07/">
            In 2006, the Turku district court convicted a Muslim
            mother for circumcising her son, however she was not
            sentenced</a>. The Court of Appeal subsequently ruled
            that the mother was not guilty of abuse. The case is
            now being considered in the <a
            href="http://www.kko.fi/27080.htm"
            target="_blank">Finnish Supreme Court</a>.<br />
            <br />
             Helsinki police are currently investigating two cases
            in which male circumcisions were performed by Muslim
            and Jewish families. Both operations were performed by
            persons brought into Finland by the families, and who
            were not medical professionals.<br />
            <br />
             Police say that complications arose following the
            procedures and the babies had to be hospitalised. The
            cases will be reviewed by the prosecutor during the
            autumn. <i>YLE</i></p>
