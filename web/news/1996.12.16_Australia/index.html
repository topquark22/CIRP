            <h2>NSW: DOCTORS REQUIRED TO USE ANAESTHESIA FOR
            CIRCUMCISION</h2>
            AAP 16/12/96 09:39 

            <p>SYDNEY, Dec 16 AAP - For the first time the New
            South Wales <a
            href="http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/">Department of
            Health</a> has today told doctors throughout the state
            to use anaesthesia for male circumcision.</p>

            <p>The department, in a <a
            href="http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/fcsd/rmc/cib/circulars/1996/cir96-94.pdf"
             target="_blank">circular</a> issued earlier this
            month, said: "It is unacceptable to perform this
            procedure without appropriate anaesthesia."</p>

            <p>But department's policy does not affect those who
            carry out circumcision for religious reasons outside
            the hospital system, including people from the Jewish
            faith known as mohels.</p>

            <p>The <a
            href="http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/Parlment/Members.nsf/0/88fa112b2f8027594a25672e0002e1c2/$FILE/Corbett.pdf"
             target="_blank">Better Future for Our Children</a> MP
            in the NSW Upper House, Alan Corbett, welcomed the
            circular as the public health system's first statewide
            policy on circumcision.</p>

            <p>"Newborns and infants feel pain and, in fact, may
            feel pain more intensely than adults ... hence, any
            circumcision is an act of extreme cruelty if it is not
            performed with appropriate pain relief before, during
            and after the procedure," Mr Corbett said in a
            statement.</p>

            <p>He also called for the government to stop Medicare
            rebates for infant circumcisions unless performed for a
            medical reason.</p>

            <p>Mr Corbett said the majority of the 5,300
            circumcisions on children aged under six months were
            performed in NSW each year for no medical reason.</p>

            <p>The department's circular of December 2 endorsed an
            earlier <a href="/library/statements/acp1996/">position
            paper</a> from the Australian College of Paediatrics on
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>The paper includes the Australasian Association of
            Paediatric Surgeons' <a
            href="/library/statements/aaps/">views</a> that
            circumcision has no medical basis and should not be
            performed before the age of six months.</p>

            <p>The college's position paper said that the operation
            was generally performed with some sort of local or
            general anaesthesia.</p>

            <p>On the question of the possible benefits of the
            operation, including reduced risks of urinary tract
            infections and later cancer of the penis, the paper
            said: "At the present time it would be wrong either to
            claim that there are definite health benefits or to
            deny that they exist."</p>
