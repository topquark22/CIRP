            <p><b>Nearly 1000 people from Bulgaria's ethnic Turkish
            minority have taken part in a mass circumcision
            ceremony for young boys, a Muslim ritual that was
            suppressed during communist times.</b></p>

            <p>A procession of parents carried the boys, aged two
            to five and clad in white shirts and blue hats, through
            the mainly Muslim town of Kardjali on Saturday.</p>

            <p>A team of doctors waited at the town's main
            mosque to carry out the procedure.</p>

            <p>Mass circumcision ceremonies are organised without
            charge for poor families.</p>

            <p>Kardjali, in the southern Rhodope mountains, is the
            centre of Bulgaria's Turkish minority, which represents
            about 10% of the Balkan country's population of eight
            million.</p>

            <p>The country's Turkish Muslims previously
            suffered significant discrimination and mistreatment,
            notably in the mid-1980s, under a policy of
            Bulgarisation and cultural assimilation.</p>

            <p>As a result, a large number of Bulgarian Turks fled
            to Turkey.</p>

            <p>But most of them returned after the fall of
            communism, and in recent years they have enjoyed more
            legal protection of their cultural identity.</p>
