            <h2>Once home to faithful converts, remote village
            finds itself faithless</h2>

            <p><b>By Adam B. Ellick</b></p>

            <p>IUDINO, Russia (JTA) &mdash; Jewish traditions
            appear to be dying in Valentina Iosifovna&rsquo;s
            Siberian village.</p>

            <p>Her alcove of a kitchen no longer holds two sets of
            dishes separating meat and dairy, the blue mezuzah
            nailed to her doorway goes untouched and she
            doesn&rsquo;t know anyone who speaks a word of
            Hebrew.</p>

            <p>The death of Judaism is hardly surprising in rural
            Russia, where Soviet sympathies still run strong and
            Jewish populations rarely exceed a half dozen.</p>

            <p>But the near disappearance of Jewish life in this
            remote village known for nothing but its peculiar
            Jewish history, and where hundreds of Jews still live,
            is testament to the ominous and ubiquitous power of
            Soviet suppression.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;We have no aim here. What can we do?
            We&rsquo;re completely helpless,&rdquo; Iosifovna, 66,
            says without a flash of grief.</p>

            <p>In many respects, Iudino isn&rsquo;t all that
            different today from its inception in the 1830s, when
            locals resided in the same wooden cabins that still
            line the same dirt roads here.</p>

            <p>Vodka remains the drink of choice at the three
            village shops, as evidenced by men staggering outside
            in midafternoon. Meat is still sold only by a vendor
            who infrequently makes his rounds on a buggy selling
            bloodied bones with raw flesh.</p>

            <p>But kugel and matzah couldn&rsquo;t compete with
            vodka and meat, leaving today&rsquo;s Iudino with only
            a handful of precious remnants from its Jewish
            heyday.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no place for faith in these
            hard times. Most important is for me to live better and
            make ends meet,&rdquo; shrugs Evdokim Derevyagin, 79,
            who recalls celebrating Passover with bearded,
            religious men. &ldquo;Our grandparents would feel pity
            that Judaism&rsquo;s almost dead today, certainly. But
            we grew up in a Soviet manner, and nothing can be
            done.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Iudino was nothing but a thick birch forest until
            the 1830s, when a handful of Russian families arrived
            from Vrornizhen, near Moscow. Although much of
            Iudino&rsquo;s history remains hazy &mdash; these
            villagers are far from accurate historians &mdash; most
            say the first settlers were a combination of Czarist
            exiles and those seeking to escape serfdom, high taxes
            and limited land plots.</p>

            <p>They discovered in this placid a fish-heavy river
            and an opportunity for tax-free farming.</p>

            <p>Inspired by their isolation from Russian Orthodox
            Czarist pressures, the families converted to what they
            considered the most humane religion, Judaism, which
            they had vaguely come to know during their days in
            European Russia. Their new faith exempted them from a
            hefty church tax.</p>

            <p>Enthralled with their new settlement, the founders
            wrote to their friends and families in European Russia,
            urging them to follow. The population quickly swelled
            with Russian farmers, many of whom converted to
            Judaism.</p>

            <p>Smaller numbers of long-time Jewish families &mdash;
            anxious to escape hunger and anti-Semitism &mdash; also
            were wooed over to offer their tutelage about issues of
            religious tradition.</p>

            <p>In 1910, a Jew by birth built a prayer house where
            he served as the religious leader, teaching Hebrew and
            Jewish traditions to the 3,000 local Jews, who were
            nicknamed Saturday People.</p>

            <p>They outnumbered the 2,000 non-Jewish farmers,
            called the Milk People, who lived across the
            village.</p>

            <p>Jewish tradition thrived. <span class="yellow">A
            local law required circumcision, though dirty tools and
            a lack of expertise resulted in death 10 percent of the
            time.</span> Circumcision continued here even during
            Soviet times, when it was strictly prohibited
            elsewhere.</p>

            <p>Burial ceremonies were the most holy events in
            Iudino, and the surviving cemetery has dozens of graves
            with Stars of David. Following Jewish tradition,
            funerals took place one day after a person&rsquo;s
            death &mdash; except on Saturdays &mdash; and locals
            drank a cup of wine and ate bread with salt at the
            cemetery. They washed their hands before returning
            home.</p>

            <p>One man worked the slaughterhouse, where he prepared
            kosher meat and ensured that the Jewish side remained
            free of pigs.</p>

            <p>The most celebrated holidays were Shabbat and
            Passover. Women prepared kugel on Friday mornings and
            bathed in public baths in the evenings, and everyone
            refrained from work on Saturdays.</p>

            <p>Most families used separate plates only on Passover.
            They prepared their own matzah with wooden tools topped
            with a gear-like device that pricked holes so the bread
            wouldn&rsquo;t rise. Matzah also was dipped in honey to
            symbolize the sweetness of freedom.</p>

            <p>But this traditional lifestyle began to dissipate in
            the 1930s, when the Soviets converted the prayer house
            into a school; it was destroyed entirely in the 1980s.
            By the 1950s, intermarriage had become rampant. Today,
            residents point to a sick elderly woman as the only
            remaining Jew from birth in the city, though there are
            a few others.</p>

            <p>The last Hebrew speaker died four years ago. Locals
            say they can&rsquo;t be bothered with religion when
            they can barely survive on their $48-a-month
            pensions.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what pocket to put it
            in,&rdquo; says Iosifovna, who still bakes matzah each
            spring.</p>

            <p>Yacov Yeroshin, a blue-eyed, boot-wearing villager,
            recites Kaddish and Yizkor in Russian for any of
            Iudino&rsquo;s 2,500 residents, about half of whom are
            Jewish converts. He learns the dates of Jewish holidays
            when his cousin in Birobidzhan mails him a
            calendar.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Now we have more freedom but no possibility
            to hire a person to conduct proper ceremonies,&rdquo;
            he says. &ldquo;Financially, life here is worse after
            perestroika. A guy who studied with the rabbi in 1910
            left me his notes, so we try to follow what we
            can,&rdquo; says Yeroshin, who is Jewish.</p>

            <p>He recently received a few yarmulkes and a Talmud
            from the Federation of Jewish Communities branch in a
            town two hours away. The American Jewish Joint
            Distribution Committee office in that same town donated
            some Shabbat candles and a menorah but refused to
            recognize the villagers as Jewish for humanitarian
            support because of their hazy history.</p>

            <p>Anna Aninkina, 85, a woman with only two teeth whose
            family converted to Judaism, may be Iudino&rsquo;s last
            practicing Jew. She is too embarrassed by her drunken
            son-in-law to accept visitors, but she pauses in the
            street to boast that she keeps Shabbat, kisses her
            mezuzah daily and refuses to eat pork because &ldquo;if
            you eat beef you&rsquo;re sinful until evening, but if
            you eat ham you&rsquo;re sinful forever.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m frustrated that no one cares
            anymore,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Our parents would be
            so sad.&rdquo;</p>
