      <h2>"Male circumcision is also mutilation"</h2>
      <b>Professor Yngve Hofvander</b> 

      <p>Circumcision of boys is a cruel and very painful
      operation. It contravenes the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">UN Convention on the
      Rights of Children</a> and should be called mutilation, just
      like female circumcision is now. So writes Professor Yngve
      Hofvander, former head of International Child Health at <a
      href="http://info.uu.se/presengl.nsf">Uppsala University</a>,
      regarding a proposed law tabled in parliament. The statement
      supporting the law is seriously conflicted. It would be
      logical even to ban male circumcision, he says. But first of
      all, the issue should be brought out into the light so that
      religious and cultural attitudes can undergo change. At the
      time of writing this, a tragic case has opened at the
      Stockholm City Court. A small Moslem boy was circumcised by a
      doctor in private practice, he screamed for several hours
      thereafter and was given a pain-relieving injection that was
      obviously of an incorrect dosage; shortly thereafter he
      ceased breathing and his life could not be saved.</p>

      <p>This is a medically meaningless operation - thus no
      complications can be considered acceptable. And yet a child
      becomes a victim in a ritual that is characterised by the
      demands of adults.</p>

      <p>In the current debate about this operation, one could
      easily get the impression that it is a particularly Jewish
      custom. Representatives of the Jewish faith have been most
      articulate - but Jewish circumcision is clearly in a
      minority.</p>

      <p>The situation is as follows. There are four different
      groups that practice circumcision. The Jewish: going back to
      Abraham 3 000 year ago (but already in existence 2000 years
      before that). Done on the eighth day, involves around 100
      boys in Sweden. The Moslem: going back around 1300 years to
      the time of the Prophet Mohammed. There is no mention in the
      Koran and therefore no commandment. Done in the period 2-14
      years of age and involves around 3000 boys in Sweden. The
      traditional African: done at the onset of puberty as an
      initiation rite for entry to the adult world. This involves
      several million boys annually. See Mandela's memoirs and his
      anxiety due to the operation.</p>

      <p>The Anglo-Saxon, mostly occurring in the USA: Developed in
      the middle of the 19th Century as a prophylaxis and treatment
      for masturbation, but thereafter a hundred other bizarre
      indications were added. Done to neonates and involves more
      than a million boys.</p>

      <p>It is thus important to see the phenomenon of circumcision
      in this entire, global context, and not as specifically
      Jewish, and neither in a provincial Swedish perspective.</p>

      <p>CIRCUMCISION IS a cruel and very painful operation.
      Hemostatic forceps are tightly closely in the narrow end of
      the immature foreskin, a brunt probe is forced between the
      foreskin and the glans and pushed around to break the
      connecting tissues that nature has put in place in babies and
      young children. One or two haemostats are driven as far as
      possible in the fold between the glans and foreskin, closed
      fast and the foreskin pulled out. Forceps are fastened across
      it and at that point it is cut off - and thus one removes the
      foreskin, which in the developed state amounts to 10cm2 and
      contains hundreds of nerve endings for erogenous purposes,
      and similar quantities of sebaceous glands (sic) that secrete
      lubricant for similar purposes.</p>

      <p>There is really no doubt about whether this process should
      be denoted as mutilation - for indeed removes healthy tissue
      is removed from a healthy body part. There has been a
      mindless fear about calling things by their correct name, due
      to the risk of offending religious groups. It took some years
      before one was able to call female circumcision, mutilation -
      but now this term is officially sanctioned.</p>

      <p>Nor is there really any doubt about whether this involves
      an abuse against a child who has not asked for the operation
      and who cannot defend himself, beyond trying break free and
      screaming loudly. One can think of the equivalent situation
      of an adult man being held down by forceful hands and
      mutilated without anaesthesia. For babies have a fully
      developed sense of pain - and memory. The hormonal and
      biochemical changes that arise in the body correspond to
      those found during torture.</p>

      <p>SINCE THERE ARE currently considerable millions of boys
      circumcised annually - can all their parents really be at
      fault for having it done?</p>

      <p>I want to answer 'unquestioningly yes' to this question.
      Many millions of girls are sexually mutilated annually - are
      their parents right or wrong? Many millions of Chinese girls
      had their feet bound so that they did not develop - were
      their parents right or wrong? It was the custom to beat
      children (with support from authorities, including
      pronouncements in the Bible!) - were their parents right or
      wrong? Up until 200 years ago it was the religious custom at
      Jewish circumcisions to suck blood from the circumcised penis
      (thereafter forbidden when it was shown to spread syphilis
      and tuberculosis) - was it right or wrong of the parents to
      accept this practice?</p>

      <p>The above-mentioned often-bizarre traditions and practices
      have had social, cultural and sometimes legal acceptance,
      within their respective cultural worlds. Afterwards, in
      accord with human justice principles, they were no longer
      tolerated and were forbidden by law or forced out of
      practice.</p>

      <p>So certainly millions of people can be wrong. There are
      many other examples of wrongful practices that have been
      inflicted particularly on children, or others without power
      or whose voices were not heard.</p>

      <p>So I say that the time has now come to seriously question
      male circumcision and mutilation. To this end we have a
      remarkable tool in the UN Convention on the Rights of the
      Child, which can indeed be applied in many contexts,
      including the planning of housing and road crossings. Article
      19 of the convention states that all legal measures should be
      taken to protect children against all forms of physical and
      mental violence, injury or abuse. And (as stated in Article
      24) countries that sign the convention are required to take
      all effective and appropriate measures to eliminate
      traditional customs that are harmful to the health of
      children. Could this be stated more clearly? Moreover,
      children have priority when interpreting the convention -
      whenever there is any difference between the rights of adults
      and children.</p>

      <p>But to change immigrant traditions, especially those with
      religious overtones, is extremely difficult. Not least in the
      case where a much longed-for party is an integral part of the
      ceremony. What makes it even harder to work against
      circumcision is that it is a very lucrative business for
      those doctors who devote themselves to this industry as
      "village barbers". This conclusion was very evident at an
      international symposium on the subject in Sydney recently.
      One cannot count on any supportive lead from within these
      circles.</p>

      <p>There are however some bright aspects. In many places
      around the world people have begun to practice circumcision
      without surgery, buy while carrying out the whole ceremony in
      all other respects. This is to oblige the many parents who
      cannot accept that their child should be mutilated, but who
      still want to be connected with their religious traditions.
      It is remarkable however that this has not been introduced in
      Sweden; no religious representative says it would be
      acceptable: "it would like vaccinating with water". Is there
      no innovator who can contemplate breaking the ice?</p>

      <p>There is now a proposed bill tabled before parliament.
      This has been circulated as a proposal to 50 interested
      parties. I have read all the responses and been depressed;
      they go off in all directions. The Jewish Central Council
      continues to assert that infants do not feel pain during the
      first two months of life and therefore they can be
      circumcised without anaesthetic, and that circumcision has
      clear medical benefits. (These assertions are officially
      refuted by a large number of weighty medical organisations in
      many countries).</p>

      <p>A NUMBER OF RESPONDENTS considered that the operation is
      compatible with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child
      - with the exception, however, of the Children's Ombudsman,
      who in all likelihood knows what she is talking about. The
      National Board of Health and Welfare failed in many aspects
      with its preceding investigation and does not want to
      undertake a resource-demanding policing function. The board
      pointed out that the requirement for pain relief would mean
      that health care personnel must perform the operation, and
      that the child must have a veto right, a point that is
      difficult to fulfil when in numerous cases one is dealing
      with babies and small children. Save The Children also
      emphasised the veto right, but did not draw the logical
      conclusion that one must therefore postpone the operation
      until the child is in its teenage years and can make manifest
      its wishes.</p>

      <p>The proposed bill is now before the parliament and will be
      reviewed by The Standing Committee on Social and Health
      Matters and in the parliamentary chamber. Of course from a
      medical point of view it would be only logical to ban the
      phenomenon, as was done with female circumcision. It would
      however be unrealistic to demand this, not primarily due to
      fear that the operation would then be transferred overseas,
      but rather to allow time for a necessary change in attitude.
      Bringing the phenomenon out into the light where it has never
      been before, and freely debating it, would assist this
      process.</p>

      <p>At the above-mentioned international circumcision congress
      in Sydney in December of 2000, there were appeals from many
      parties that Sweden must continue to stand out as a good
      model of child health care, and not further sanction the
      circumcision of boys with an law officially accepting
      circumcision as such (even with safe surgical measures). The
      law would go against all the good forces around the world
      working for enlightenment and to end circumcision.</p>

      <p>As a minimum, the legislation must firmly state that
      circumcision is contrary to the Convention on the Rights of
      the Child, and that the law - if it is to be - should have a
      time limit while awaiting a very welcome change in
      attitudes.</p>
