      Medical Checks</font></h2>

      <p><b>July 11, 2001</b></p>
      <b>Makhudu Sefara</b> 

      <p>A LEADING Eastern Cape surgeon and specialist in
      circumcision has recommended that initiates undergo
      pre-circumcision school medical examinations to help reduce
      deaths at initiation schools around the country.</p>

      <p>Dr Mamisa Chabela of Motherwell in Port Elizabeth also
      suggested in an interview with Sowetan that communities that
      are hard hit by deaths at circumcision schools might also
      consider using a disposable single-use gadget, the Taraklamp,
      to bring down levels of excessive bleeding.</p>

      <p>Chabela said the Taraklamp also helped reduce the risk of
      transmision of sexually transmitted diseases, HIV and
      hepatitis B, which can cause cancer of the liver.</p>

      <p>She said deaths at circumcision schools were preventable,
      but people needed to follow certain procedures to turn the
      tide.</p>

      <p>Chabela's comments coincided with an announcement by the
      police in Northern Province that two more youths had died at
      circumcision schools, bringing to seven the number in the
      province.</p>

      <p>Eastern Cape department of health spokesman Mr
      Mahlubandile Mageda told Sowetan yesterday that a number
      stood at 11 by yesterday.</p>

      <p>"Most deaths were caused by dehydration, sepsis (blood
      infection) and assaults at the circumcisions schools," said
      Mageda.</p>

      <p>He said so rife and widespread was the problem that the
      department had appointed intervention units to monitor
      problematic circumcision schools. He said that dehydration
      was caused by excessive bleeding, which led to the weakening
      of the body and eventual death.</p>

      <p>Northern Province police spokesman Inspector Moatshe
      Ngoepe said post- mortem results showed that all five victims
      in the Lowveld region died as a result of a combination of
      excessive bleeding and pneumonia.</p>

      <p>Police also said that two of those who died in the Far
      North had suffered excessive bleeding. One was still in the
      Tshilidzini Hospital in a critical condition.</p>

      <p>Chabela said she had involved herself in circumcision
      matters, normally an exclusively male domain, when boys were
      brought to her surgery after botched circumcisions.</p>

      <p>"In some cases I found that the boys suffered from
      gangrene, a condition when blood does not flow to the wound,"
      she said.</p>

      <p>"In the worst cases bad wound management led to removal of
      the front part of the penis and at times the complete removal
      of the penis if it threatened one's life."</p>

      <p>Some boys committed suicide after their penises were
      removed in hospitals.</p>

      <p>She said since the programme was adopted at Motherwell in
      1991, no single death was recorded. The broader South African
      community, she said, could benefit by emulating the
      programme.</p>
