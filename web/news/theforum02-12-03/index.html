            <h2>Attorneys debate, question nurses in circumcision
            trial</h2>

            <p>By Jeff Baird<br />
             <a

            <p>The Forum - 02/12/2003</p>

            <p>Attorneys sparred Tuesday over details in <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Hospital</a>'s medical
            records, disagreeing on if they proved Anita Flatt
            received adequate information before her son's
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>Five MeritCare nurses testified in <a
            href="http://www.co.cass.nd.us/" target="_blank">Cass
            County</a> District Court that while they don't
            remember Flatt's stay at the hospital in March 1997,
            records indicate it was uneventful and that the proper
            discussions on circumcision took place.</p>

            <p>Flatt attorney <a
            href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a>, however, pointed to
            several spots where the records didn't accurately
            reflect what happened between March 5, the day Flatt
            was admitted to the hospital, and March 8, the day she
            was discharged.</p>

            <p>When <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/COURT/DISTRICTS/EC.HTM"
             target="_blank">East Central District</a> <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/Rothe-Seeger.htm"
             target="_blank">Judge Cynthia Rothe-Seeger</a> asked
            where he was going with his line of questioning, Baer
            said he was trying to prove to jurors they can't rely
            on records alone in determining what happened with the
            circumcision.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.zbaer.com/anita.htm"
            target="_blank">Flatt</a>, of <a
            href="http://www.hawley.govoffice.com/"
            target="_blank">Hawley</a>, Minn., is suing <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734">
            Dr. Sunita Kantak</a> and <a
            href="http://www.ci.fargo.nd.us/default.asp"
            target="_blank">Fargo</a>-based <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Hospital</a>, claiming she
            and her husband, James, weren't told complete and
            accurate information about removing the foreskin from
            their son's penis.</p>

            <p>She has told the jury she did not receive any
            information prior to her son's birth about the risks
            and benefits of circumcision.</p>

            <p>She says she never received the booklet MeritCare
            gives to parents regarding the procedure, and only
            talked to Kantak briefly about the pain involved before
            the procedure was performed.</p>

            <p>Had Flatt understood the risks involved in the
            procedure, she wouldn't have had it done, she said.</p>

            <p>MeritCare nurse Rita Frovarp told jurors she has
            watched Kantak explain the risks and benefits of
            circumcision to parents more than 200 times. She said
            Kantak's discussion is thorough, and she has even
            talked parents out of having their child
            circumcised.</p>

            <p>Nursing records don't show any visits between Kantak
            and Flatt on March 6 and 7, Baer said. Dr. Kantak
            performed the circumcision about 10:45 a.m. March 7,
            Baer said. But nursing records don't document Kantak
            being at the hospital until 11 a.m., he said.</p>

            <p>The records, Baer told the six women and four men on
            the jury, also don't show Flatt received an epidural at
            MeritCare, which she did.</p>

            <p>In cross examination, MeritCare attorneys said
            newborn nursery records show Kantak was in the nursery
            March 6, the day Flatt's child was born.</p>

            <p>Also, a note Kantak made in Flatt's son's medical
            record indicates she did discuss circumcision with
            Flatt.</p>

            <p>The trial, which is in its seventh day, is expected
            to end this week.</p>
