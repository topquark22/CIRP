            <h2>A plague on culture</h2>

            <p><b>Because circumcision is cultural does not make it
            acceptable</b></p>

            <p>Now, let me get this right. To be a man, what you
            need to do is to wait until you are 16. Then you need
            to join what in this part of the world gets called a
            "school". The "principal" of this said "school" takes
            you off into the mountains in the middle of winter,
            strips you, beats you to a pulp, starves you, refuses
            you water, makes you sing and then chops off your
            foreskin with a blade that is likely to cause an
            infection of one sort or another so that, in all
            likelihood, you either lose you penis in its entirety
            or, worse, your life.</p>

            <p>That's what has been going on here lately. And
            believe me, not for the first time either. It happens
            every winter. And every winter we all watch shivering
            16-year-old survivors of circumcision schools lying in
            hospital. We see anguished parents saying they didn't
            know that their child had gone to the school and now
            they are dead. And then we have to sit through this
            Africanist and that traditionalist saying how important
            it all is and this nurse and that doctor saying how
            tragic it all is.</p>

            <p>But it is culture and God forbid we should dare
            actually to criticise it, let alone reject it outright
            or condemn it as nonsense of the highest possible
            grade. No, that we can't do because everyone is so keen
            to tango on the cultural eggshells. Thank God for the
            Zulus, I say. Because they once had a leader who was
            brave enough and sure enough of himself and sensible
            enough and (some would say) pragmatic enough just to do
            away with the ghastly practice with a majesterial wave
            of his royal hand.</p>

            <p>And so began another culture just as strong---this
            time with foreskins, proving once and for all the utter
            senselessness and stupidity of those who would argue
            that life as a man can only begin once a God-given
            piece of you is chopped off. The cultural contradiction
            is thus fully exposed. But put a Zulu and a Xhosa man
            in the same room, the latter circumcised and the former
            not, and I promise you there will be a merry showdown
            about who is a man and who is not and why. Thank God
            for the Zulus, because otherwise the whole thing could
            so easily be turned into something racial as well
            (forgetting that the Americans circumcise routinely, of
            course).</p>

            <p>If we object to female circumcision on grounds of
            barbarism, what on earth makes us not reject male
            circumcision as a cultural practice? There is no logic
            in the argument. But culture, as we all know so well,
            seldom operates on the level of logic.</p>

            <p>Many years ago, in the eighties, I helped six or
            seven young Cosas members who were in trouble. The
            noose of the security cordon around Grahamstown was
            being tightened and they were in grave danger of being
            caught. I helped them to get across the border to
            Lesotho.</p>

            <p>And something I will never forget is when we were
            driving towards the Lesotho border, suddenly one of
            them got very agitated. The freedom songs ground to a
            halt and a serious discussion took place in Xhosa. I
            asked what was going on, because one of the boys looked
            extremely worried. They told me. They were all very
            excited about leaving the country. They were very
            excited indeed about joining the underground. But how
            were they going to get circumcised in Lusaka?</p>

            <p>I had a discussion the other day, with an intern
            from <a href="http://www.wits.ac.za/"
            target="_blank">Wits University</a> who is working on
            our project, about the subject. He is Xhosa. He went to
            circumcision school and it clearly had a very large
            impact on his life. When he talks about it, he shows no
            regret. He says there are things that he can't talk
            about. Would he force his son to do it? No, he says, he
            would allow his son to make up his own mind. He would
            put to his son the benefits as he saw it and leave it
            at that. I believe he would, but what I don't think he
            is able to see is that the pressure to conform
            culturally would be quite enormous and would far
            outweigh any notion of objective decision-making on his
            son's part.</p>

            <p>That is what culture can, and does, do. It pushes
            you into a corner. It forces you to conform and in the
            end, it leaves you with very little indeed, if you are
            not deeply critical about it. And in the end, we are
            left staring at each other's penises in the effort to
            determine which of us is in the in group and which of
            us is not, not unlike the Nazis did to the Jews.</p>

            <p>I believe that circumcision schools should be
            banned. I believe that those who run them should be
            charged and put in prison. I think circumcision is
            completely wrong when it is practised by adults on
            children and I think it is a complete violation of
            their rights to their own bodies.</p>

            <p>I have no view whatsoever on adults who want to
            mutilate themselves. I have only mild nausea about
            people who want to stick pins through their tongues,
            noses, belly buttons, ears and other available parts of
            their bodies. If people want to walk over fire, let
            them do so. If they want to hammer swords into their
            stomachs, please, be my guest. I accept that this is
            entirely, completely, absolutely their own business and
            my nausea is mine. But not children. That is a
            different thing altogether. And not 16-year-olds who
            can be persuaded by just about anything anyone around
            them does. These are different matters entirely.</p>

            <p>The fact that it is tied up with someone or other's
            culture is entirely irrelevant to the argument in just
            the same way as we would need to reject most other
            forms of inhuman treatment dressed up in cultural garb,
            such as ritual murder for instance. Because a thing is
            cultural makes it neither good nor acceptable in its
            own right. Because a thing is cultural, or even because
            a thing is widely practised, gives it no credibility at
            all on its own.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-human/">Human
            rights</a> has got to be the standard here. We have no
            other. Every form of religion, in its own way and some
            more viciously than others, has people doing things
            that others regard as crazy or inhuman or degrading. So
            religion cannot provide us with any standard.</p>

            <p>Human rights must judge culture. Or if not that, it
            must hold it very firmly in check.</p>
