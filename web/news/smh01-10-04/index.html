            <h2>May the foreskin be with you</h2>

            <p><b>Dr Karl S. Kruszelnicki</b><br />
             tackles life's myths, curiosities and absurdities</p>

            <p>Circumcision goes back a long way - Egyptian male
            mummies dating back to 2300BC have been circumcised.
            Its popularity now varies from country to country - in
            Australia, between 10 and 20 per cent of newborn males
            are circumcised each year, compared with more than 60
            per cent in the US and less than 2 per cent in
            Scandinavia. It has long been practised for religious
            reasons and as a rite of passage in various societies.
            But there's a (supposed) health issue, too: many
            parents have circumcised their sons in the belief that
            it is more hygienic. It's not.</p>

            <p>As Dr Robert Darby <a
            href="http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/178_04_170203/dar10676_fm.html"
            target="_blank">wrote</a> in the <i>Medical Journal of
            Australia</i> in 2003, "in the days before aseptic
            surgery, any cutting of the flesh was the least
            hygienic thing anybody could do, carrying a high risk
            of bleeding, infection and death."</p>

            <p>So how did this myth arise? Wars are very
            unsanitary, and uncircumcised soldiers were thought to
            be at risk of serious infection around the foreskin if
            they couldn't wash frequently. This claim was made in
            the First and Second World Wars, as well as in both
            Gulf Wars. In desert wars, it became known as the "sand
            myth." Dr Ken McGrath, a senior lecturer in pathology
            at the <a href="http://www.aut.ac.nz/"
            target="_blank">Auckland University of Technology</a>,
            could find no evidence to support it. And Sir Duncan
            Stout, who wrote a chapter on military medicine in the
            tome <i>History of the Second World War</i>, did not
            make any reference to circumcision being used to cure
            foreskin problems. In fact, his official records
            claimed the opposite - there was a great reluctance to
            perform circumcisions because the sand in the Sahara
            Desert was as fine as flour, and was almost impossible
            to keep out of clothing and away from the skin.</p>

            <p>But why remove the foreskin? Dr Paul Fleiss,
            assistant clinical professor of pediatrics at the
            University of Southern California Centre, says the
            foreskin is "a uniquely specialised, sensitive,
            functional organ of touch." It make proteins that fight
            bacteria and viruses, and produces a moisturiser that
            keeps the surface of the glans sensitive, soft and
            moist. Indeed, it has more <a
            href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">specialised nerve
            endings</a> than any other part of the penis, and is as
            sensitive as the lips of the mouth.</p>

            <p>When did circumcision become linked to hygiene?
            Probably during the Victorian era, when it was promoted
            as a way to desensitise the penis to thwart
            masturbation, which was thought to cause headaches,
            paralysis, bed-wetting, insanity, epilepsy,
            tuberculosis, short-sightedness, criminality and heart
            disease. The hygiene that circumcision was meant to
            encourage was, it seems, not physical but moral.</p>

            <p>As far as personal hygiene is concerned, removing
            the foreskin to have a cleaner penis makes as much
            sense as removing the eyelid to have a cleaner
            eyeball.</p>
