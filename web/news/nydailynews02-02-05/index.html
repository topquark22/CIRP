            <h3>Probe death of baby after circumcision</h3>
            By MAGGIE HABERMAN<br />
             DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER 

            <p>City health officials are investigating whether a
            <span class="yellow">baby boy died</span> after
            contracting herpes from the rabbi who circumcised him,
            the <i>Daily News</i> has learned.</p>

            <p>The probe was launched after city officials realized
            that three infants in the city who tested positive for
            herpes last year all were circumcised by Rabbi Yitzchok
            Fischer. The Rockland County-based Fischer is a
            prominent <i>mohel</i> - someone who performs religious
            circumcisions.</p>

            <p>Under Jewish law, a <i>mohel</i> is supposed to draw
            blood from the circumcision wound to remove impurities.
            While many <i>mohels</i> do it by hand, Fischer uses a
            practice little known outside ultra-Orthodox
            communities called <i>metzizah bi peh</i>, in which the
            mohel uses his mouth.</p>

            <p>On Oct. 16, 2004, Fischer performed a <i>bris</i>,
            or religious circumcision, on twins. Ten days later,
            one infant died of herpes, and the other tested
            positive for the virus, according to papers filed in
            Manhattan Supreme Court by city lawyers.</p>

            <p>A few weeks later, city <a
            href="http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/doh/home.html">Health
            Department</a> officials found a third baby, on Staten
            Island, who also tested positive for herpes after being
            circumcised by Fischer in late 2003, the papers
            say.</p>

            <p>Herpes is far more dangerous to infants than adults
            because of babies' fragile immune systems. The health
            status of the two surviving boys was not clear
            yesterday.</p>

            <p>The city "is concerned that the possible
            transmission of herpes simplex virus type 1 in infants
            may be continuing as a result of defendant's practice
            of <i>metzizah bi peh</i>," city lawyers wrote in the
            complaint, dated Dec. 22. "Defendant's conduct to date
            constitutes a threat to the public health."</p>

            <p>The custom of <i>metzizah</i> is thousands of years
            old. But experts said that these days, many
            <i>mohels</i> breathe in through a sterile tube to draw
            the blood instead of using their mouths directly on the
            wound, although in some ultra-Orthodox sects, the oral
            practice is mandatory.</p>

            <p>The city asked Fischer to submit to a blood test in
            November, and ordered him to stop performing
            <i>metzizah</i> by mouth while waiting for the results,
            court papers show. Officials told him to use a sterile
            tube and gloves in the meantime.</p>

            <p>But the Health Department got a report that Fischer
            wasn't following the order, so the city filed the legal
            complaint to compel him do so.</p>

            <p>Fischer, 66, declined to comment yesterday.</p>

            <p>His lawyer, Mark Kurzmann, wouldn't say whether
            Fischer has done the blood test, citing medical
            confidentiality. But he said Fischer is "cooperating
            with the city's investigation to resolve this
            matter."</p>

            <p>"My client is known internationally as a caring,
            skilled and conscientious <i>mohel</i>," Kurzmann
            said.</p>

            <p>He suggested the babies could have contracted herpes
            elsewhere. He also said there are concerns about the
            government regulating religious practices.</p>

            <p>City lawyers declined to comment.</p>

            <p>Health officials, aware of the sensitivity of the
            issue, have been talking extensively to community
            leaders.</p>

            <p>"There's been a constructive dialogue between the
            community and the <a
            href="http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/doh/home.html"
            target="_blank">Department of Health</a>, and we're
            working with [them] to ensure the safety of all our
            city's children," said Arie Lipnic, spokesman for City
            Councilman Simcha Felder (D-Brooklyn).<br />
