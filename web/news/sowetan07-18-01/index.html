      <h2>Is There Place for a Scalpel in the Bush?</h2>
      <b>OPINION</b> 

      <p>Posted to the web July 18, 2001</p>

      <b>Makhudu Sefara, Pietersburg Bureau Chief</b>

      <p>It's supposed to be a rite of passage when boys are
      ushered into manhood by the elders of their communities. This
      centuries-old tradition, handed down for generations, is now
      attracting unprecedented attention, but for all the wrong
      reasons.</p>

      <p>Every year during the winter holidays, thousands of boys
      head to initiation schools, most of them of their own free
      will - but a minority under duress.</p>

      <p>While most become men, others are not so lucky. Some die
      an excruciating death from septic wounds and many are maimed
      for life. Is this what the rite is supposed to be? And for
      those who survive the wounds, are their scars a memory they
      want to carry into adulthood?</p>

      <p>The deaths at circumcision schools, especially during the
      latest school break, have cast a dark shadow across the
      practice once revered for turning boys into idolised men of
      reverence.</p>

      <p>Botched circumcisions have cost 28 lives already, pushing
      what is supposed to be a secret practice into sharp public
      focus. The hardest hit provinces are Eastern Cape, Northern
      Province, North West and KwaZulu-Natal.</p>

      <p>The initiation practice, once so sacrosanct that it was
      only performed by known practitioners approved of by a local
      chief, has in the recent past been infiltrated by
      unscrupulous mercenaries who, when faced with a shortage of
      initiates, simply "kidnap" youngsters. Those forcibly
      circumcised include children.</p>

      <p>The practice has also come under fire from health workers,
      who say that "unqualified traditional surgeons" are
      performing the circumcisions and are botching them. Many
      initiates land in hospitals. Some do not come out alive.</p>

      <p>The manhood of many boys becomes septic and they die,
      while others develop gangrene, a condition caused by a lack
      of blood flowing to the wound.</p>

      <p>Traditional leaders and surgeons are unable to tackle
      certain problems of hygiene and to stop excessive bleeding.
      The weakened immune systems of many initiates spell doom for
      the boys who are usually stuck in the middle of nowhere far
      from hospitals.</p>

      <p>South Africa has no policy to regulate circumcision and
      this makes it easier for chancers to spoil the party for
      those still doing it right. HIV- Aids now presents an even
      greater challenge to this rite.</p>

      <p>In the wake of these challenges, shouldn't we be thinking
      about changing the way circumcisions are done, without losing
      their traditional value and costing lives unnecessarily? Can
      we make the procedure safer?</p>

      <p>Dr Eddy Mhlanga, chief director responsible for youth and
      women's health in the Department of Health, says they have
      started encouraging people to use hospitals because they are
      "safer than the mountains".</p>

      <p>Mhlanga suggests that if people insist on following the
      age-old tradition, the surgical part, which is the cutting of
      the foreskin, should be done in hospitals or clinics. The
      other rituals can be conducted in the bush.</p>

      <p>National House of Traditional Leaders chairman Nkosi
      Mpiyezintombi Mzimela says change is inevitable.</p>

      <p>"As long as culture is not changed just for the sake of
      changing it, we welcome the advancement of technology into
      the bush."</p>

      <p>Mzimela's deputy, Morena Matheadira Mopeli of the Free
      State, says culture is not rigid. "In this era of many deaths
      and killer diseases, we cannot fold our arms when confronted
      with problems that seek Western-inspired solutions to our
      African traditional practices."</p>

      <p>Masodi Legodi, a mother from Rustenburg, says there is
      nothing more painful than sending your child to die at a
      circumcision school.</p>

      <p>"If technology permits, we should use it to advance our
      culture," she says.</p>

      <p>Asked why people kept on sending their children to
      initiation schools, she says: "It is a question of pride. It
      is about being African and having no regrets about it. But
      others do it because of societal pressures." Florence
      Dlangalala, who had her son Sizwe (13) rescued from an
      initiation school last year in Beverly Hills, Johannesburg,
      is more forthright.</p>

      <p>"These circumcision schools have outlived their purpose
      and should be closed down forever," she says.</p>

      <p>"There is nothing these boys learn in the mountains. They
      say they learn how to survive and become good people, when in
      fact they learn how to do crime and also rape us. Some of the
      principals are small kids who smoke dagga and drink alcohol.
      The result is that they cut more than they are supposed to.
      Enough is enough."</p>

      <p>Other observers have questioned the value the rites have
      to children as young as 10. They will most probably have
      forgotten everything by the time they become men, cynics
      argue.</p>

      <p>Mhlanga puts it more aptly: "People must not resist change
      or else we are doomed. Do we want to have a nation that is
      traditionally correct, but with most men's penises fallen off
      as a result of surgical blunders in the mountains?</p>

      <p>"Or do we want a healthy nation using Western influences
      and technology to advance our traditional practice?"</p>

      <p>Dr Mamisa Chabula, a leading Eastern Cape expert on
      circumcision, says traditional leaders must still perform the
      practice, but only by those trained in surgical
      procedure.</p>

      <p>"But firstly I believe there should be pre-medical
      examinations to check if would-be initiates have any
      illnesses that may develop into complications. If they are
      detected early, they can be dealt with," says Chabula.</p>

      <p>She says the use of a Taraklamp, a gadget that reduces
      bleeding during cuts, could be a solution.</p>

      <p>While on a fact-finding mission to Malaysia, Chabula
      learnt that the use of the Taraklamp helped reduce excessive
      bleeding and prevented the contraction of hepatitis B, which
      causes cancer of the liver. She says the idea was shot down
      three years ago "simply because it was made by a woman".</p>

      <p>The Motherwell municipality and Eastern Cape government
      have recently begun to embrace the idea and no deaths have
      been recorded in Motherwwell since they started using the
      Taraklamp, she says.</p>

      <p>Kgoshi Setlamorago Thobejane takes a dim view of attempts
      to alter culture to deal with modern influences. Thobejane
      says he is sick and tired of black people behaving like
      stooges of the West, thinking everything black and African is
      ill-fated.</p>

      <p>Thobejane says when people die in accidents, hospitals or
      from Aids, nobody puts the West on trial.</p>

      <p>"But when 10 people die at an initiation school, we are
      pestered and put on trial. We try to adopt a no-death policy
      but almost always people die - just like they die at
      hospitals," says Thobejane.</p>

      <p>He says the media has launched a witch-hunt against
      traditional leaders to appease its white bosses.</p>

      <p>"When I grew up, about 50 of the 70 people who went to a
      circumcision school in our area died. But nobody made a
      noise. Now that you (black journalists) go to white schools,
      you want to appease your white bosses at the expense of our
      tradition," he says.</p>

      <p>People should not go into the practice for money, but for
      the love of it, he says. In that way, he argues, deaths are
      minimised.</p>

      <p>Deaths at circumcision schools will remain a talking point
      and the Government cannot fold its arms. A national policy
      framework is needed to regulate this traditional rite.</p>

      <p>Unnecessary deaths must be minimised. If culture is,
      indeed, dynamic, the practice must either adapt or die.</p>
