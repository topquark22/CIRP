            <h2>Oxford couple sues over circumcision mishap</h2>

            <p><b><big>STAMFORD &mdash; An Oxford couple on
            Wednesday sued a doctor who they say partially
            amputated their son&rsquo;s penis during a circumcision
            at <a href="http://www.stvincents.org/"
            target="_blank">St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital</a> in
            Bridgeport.</big></b></p>

            <p>Immediately after his injury last June, the day-old
            boy was transferred to <a href="http://www.ynhh.org/"
            target="_blank">Yale-New Haven Hospital</a> where he
            underwent reconstructive surgery.</p>

            <p>"We are bringing this case because we already know
            this baby has suffered a horrible, life-altering
            physical injury, but we are still learning about the
            longterm ramifications of the injury," said <a
            href="http://www.sgtlaw.com/?section=attorneys&amp;idAttorney=3"
             target="_blank">Ernest Teitell</a>, one of the
            boy&rsquo;s attorneys. "What happened will profoundly
            affect him as he grows older."</p>

            <p>Circumcision, often performed for religious reasons,
            involves removing foreskin from the penis.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.aap.org/"
            target="_blank">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> says
            most <a
            href="/library/complications/">complications</a> from
            the procedure, such as bleeding, are usually minor.</p>

            <p>Robin Biondo, the boy&rsquo;s mother, said <a
            href="http://www.gotomydoc.com/Practices/GalliancehealthCT/gottschall.html"
             target="_blank">Dr. Daniel S. Gottschall</a> cut off
            40 percent of the tip of her son&rsquo;s penis.</p>

            <p>"It was a very difficult thing to go through to see
            your newborn child laying there and wondering how much
            pain he was in and how this is going to affect him,"
            Biondo said.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/santacruzsentinel06-09-01/">
            In 2001, a jury in California awarded $1.42 million to
            a 7-year-old boy for a botched circumcision.</a></p>

            <p>In another case, the late <a
            href="/news/winnipegsun05-10-04/">David Reimer</a>, a
            Canadian, was born as a boy but raised as a girl after
            a botched circumcision.</p>

            <p>The lawsuit, filed in <a
            href="http://www.jud.state.ct.us/directory/directory/directions/2.htm">
            Bridgeport Superior Court</a>, seeks unspecified
            damages from Dr. Gottschall, who performed the surgery
            last June, and his medical and surgical group, Alliance
            for Women&rsquo;s Health.</p>

            <p>Gottschall said he has performed more than 1,000
            circumcisions without a problem.</p>

            <p>"There was a slight tip that was removed, recognized
            and repaired," Gottschall said. "We believe there was a
            congenital deformity of the penis that made the injury
            more likely. Because of my diligence, the boy had the
            repair that was necessary."</p>

            <p>The boy, now nine months old, spent about 10 days in
            the hospital, according to his mother.</p>
