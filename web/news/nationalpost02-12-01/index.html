      <h2>Circumcision is against the Charter, group says</h2>

      <p>Dr. Arif Bhimji says parents should not translate
      religious beliefs into a surgical procedure on a
      non-consenting child.</p>

      <p>A new Canadian group called the Association for Genital
      Integrity has applied for public funding to launch a court
      challenge aimed at banning the circumcision of baby boys.</p>

      <p>The challenge relies on the <a
      href="http://canada.justice.gc.ca/loireg/charte/const_en.html">
      Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> to contest a section of
      the Criminal Code that prohibits female genital mutilation, a
      stance activists say discriminates against men by not
      providing equal protection under the law.</p>

      <p>"Every day in this country a quarter of the boys that are
      born are having this procedure performed on them without
      their consent and without any medical need. We don't see why
      half of our society should be protected by a law and not the
      other half," said Dr. Arif Bhimji, a Newmarket emergency room
      physician.</p>

      <p>"The intention [of the challenge] is to provide equal
      protection to all citizens," said Dr. Bhimji, who is a
      spokesman for the group.</p>

      <p>The association has applied to the <a
      href="http://www.ccppcj.ca/">Court Challenges Program</a>, a
      federally funded agency that provides financial assistance
      for equality issues, for $46,639.50 to prepare the case.</p>

      <p>The program is expected to assess applications next
      month.</p>

      <p>Section 268 of the Criminal Code of Canada defines the
      offence of aggravated assault and specifically names only the
      components of the female genitalia in a subsection
      prohibiting genital excision.</p>

      <p>"The use of such gender-specific anatomical terms implies
      that males are not protected equally under the law. Males, no
      less than females, are subject to an unnecessary surgical
      intervention on the genitals -- namely non-therapeutic
      circumcision," said Dr. Bhimji. Section 15 of the Charter
      guarantees equality before and under the law and equal
      protection and benefit of the law. The group also views the
      practice of infant circumcision as a violation of a child's
      right to security of the person, which is Section 7 of the
      Charter.</p>

      <p>Circumcision remains the most common surgery in North
      America. "Nobody wants to directly respond to the issue,"
      said Dr. Bhimji.</p>

      <p>"The only way we can have the people in power to address
      this is by challenging in the one area that we know the
      government must listen, the courts."</p>

      <p>Frank Dimant, a spokesman for <a
      href="http://www.bnaibrith.ca/">B'nai B'rith Canada</a>, a
      Jewish advocacy organization, said such a move would be
      disastrous to the Jewish and Muslim communities that require
      male circumcision as part of their religious practice.</p>

      <p>"It would be a tremendous hardship. It is unbelievable
      that a law would be enacted in Canada that would preclude
      Jews from circumcising sons at the time of birth," Mr. Dimant
      said.</p>

      <p>"This is a religious prerequisite for us; one of the
      absolute critical tenets of our faith and we have complied
      with that commandment for thousands of years. Once this
      challenge to the charter moves forward, there will be many of
      us who will be in opposition."</p>

      <p>Mr. Dimant said B'nai B'rith Canada, and likely many
      others, will seek intervenor status, allowing it to make
      arguments on the merits of the challenge to a judge, if the
      case makes it into court.</p>

      <p>He would expect, in the least, an allowance for religious
      groups would be made in any new law.</p>

      <p>Dr. Bhimji, a Muslim, said he expects the right of an
      individual to security to supercede the right of a parent to
      translate their religious belief into a surgical procedure on
      a non-consenting child.</p>

      <p>"The courts consistently state that you cannot cause harm
      in the name of religion," he said.</p>

      <p>Mr. Dimant said opposition evidence would be based on
      medical as well as religious information. "I think we will be
      able to call upon eminent individuals in the medical field
      that will certainly stand by the position we have held for
      thousands of years," Mr. Dimant said.</p>

      <p>Circumcision was once routine in most North American
      hospitals, but a mounting body of medical evidence suggests
      the procedure is largely unnecessary and the practice is in
      decline.</p>

      <p>In 1996, the Canadian Pediatric Society published an <a
      href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm">extensive
      report</a> in the Canadian Medical Association Journal that
      concluded, as an official stance, that routine circumcision
      is not recommended.</p>

      <p>The Association for Genital Integrity brings together a
      number of people and organizations opposed to the routine
      circumcision of infants, including the <a
      href="http://www.infocirc.org/">Circumcision Information
      Resource Centre</a>, a Montreal-based organization led by
      John Antonopoulos, and <a
      href="http://www.intact.ca/">Intact</a>, led by Lawrence
      Barichello, which is organizing a class-action lawsuit on
      behalf of Canadian men circumcised as infants.</p>
