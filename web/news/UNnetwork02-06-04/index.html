            <h2>Niger: Legal Ban On Female Circumcision Widely
            Ignored</h2>

            <p>February 6, 2004<br />
             Posted to the web February 6, 2004</p>
            Niamey 

            <p>Niger's Minister for Social Development and Women's
            Affairs called on Friday for a government crackdown of
            Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), widely known as female
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>The practice was made illegal in this poor West
            African country three years ago, but it remains
            widespread and no-one has ever been prosecuted for
            performing the crude operation.</p>

            <p>The minister, Abdoulwahid Halimatou Oueini, issued
            her appeal to mark the first ever world-wide Anti-FGM
            Day at a ceremony in the village of Komba, 28km south
            east of the capital Niamey.</p>

            <p>Komba was chosen because, in 1994, it was the first
            village in Niger where local health officials denounced
            the practice, which is still carried out by a number
            ethnic groups in the region.</p>

            <p>As the minister spoke, a group of 24 villages near
            the western town of Tillaberry issued a joint
            proclamation that they would abandon FMG, which has
            until now been widely practiced in these
            communities.</p>

            <p>"Among certain ethnic groups, excision is a rights
            of passage for young women, a young woman who has not
            had the operation is subjected to ridicule by her peers
            and she will have great difficulty finding in
            marrying," explained Selon Halilou Hassan, a
            traditional healer from the Boukoki suburb of the
            capital Niamey.</p>

            <p>FGM generally involves the removal of a woman's
            clitoris and parts of the external genitalia, to reduce
            the woman's sex drive. Many in Niger, including some
            women, see this as a good thing.</p>

            <p>"In effect the removal of the clitoris, a very
            sensitive organ, reduces the sex drive of a woman and
            guarantees a woman is faithful in her marriage,"
            explained Mariam Adamou, an old woman who also lives in
            Niamey.</p>

            <p>Six ethnic groups which account for about a third of
            Niger's 11 million population practice female
            circumcision. They are the Peulh, Gourmantche,
            Djerma-Songhai, Kurtey Wogo and Arabs.</p>

            <p>No recent figures are available as to the extent of
            the practice, which is carried out covertly.</p>

            <p>Medical complications frequently occur and some
            girls even die, mainly from heavy bleeding. However,
            the traditional "exciseuses" that carry out the
            operation, usually with a razor blade in unsanitary
            conditions, are reluctant to take the girls to
            hospital.</p>

            <p>"When a girl is injured and when she looses blood,
            you don't take her to the hospital. You use acacia
            leaves to make a suture to calm the hemorrhage,"
            explained one practitioner who gave her name only as
            Haoua. Girls are taken to Haoua for the crude operation
            before they reach the age of 15. Their parents pay her
            500 CFA, about US$ 1, for her services. Some simply
            give her a grain as a gift.</p>

            <p>The Niger government is concerned that besides
            damaging girls' health, the practice is also fuelling
            the spread of HIV/AIDS through the use of
            non-sterilised blades.</p>

            <p>In theory, persons convicted of carrying out the
            operation face a prison sentence of between 6 months
            and three years. That can rise to between 10 and 20
            years if the girl dies of her wounds.</p>

            <p>Trained doctors who carry out the procedure can be
            struck off for up to five years.</p>

            <p>However, these laws have yet to put anyone in
            prison.</p>

            <p>The World Day for Zero Tolerence of FGM, was
            established after the pan-African lobby group, the <a
            href="http://www.iac-ciaf.ch/"
            target="_blank">Inter-African Committee</a> (IAC) met
            to seek ways of combating the practice last year.</p>

            <p>According to the <a href="http://www.who.int/"
            target="_blank">World Health Organisation</a>, (WHO),
            up to 2 million girls are circumcised every year, most
            of them in Africa.</p>

            <p>FGM is widespread in West Africa, where Burkina Faso
            has led the way in combatting the practice over the
            past 12 years with a considerable degree of
            success.</p>

            <p>According to survey figures released in Ouagadougou
            last month, the percentage of women subjected to the
            operation has fallen to just one or two percent in some
            parts of the country from more than 50 percent when the
            campaign against FGM started in 1992.</p>
