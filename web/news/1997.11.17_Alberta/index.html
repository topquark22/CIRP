    <h2>FURIOUS DEBATE OVER FORESKINS</h2>
    <i>A medical ethicist challenges parents' right to authorize
    circumcision</i> 

    <p>Earlier this year, the <i>New England Journal of
    Medicine</i> published a study about a pain suppressing cream
    designed for new-born boys who are about to be circumcised. The
    study angered anti-circumcisionists; they think trying to
    lessen babies pain is laudable, but they are unhappy because
    the study involved a control group of infants who had their
    foreskins removed the usual way, without anesthesia. Margaret
    Somerville, founder of Montreal's McGill Center for Medicine,
    Ethics and Law, says that the study was unethical and that
    circumcision is a form of "criminal assault." She and a growing
    group of angry "victims" think that circumcision is a
    human-rights issue, not a medical one.</p>

    <p>For centuries doctors performed circumcisions without
    anesthesia assuming that babies could handle the pain if they
    even noticed it. These days, most doctors agree that babies can
    feel pain for circumcisions done without anesthesia. Most
    circumcisions are still done that way, however, because the
    risks of anesthetizing a newborn are considered not worth the
    price of momentary pain.</p>

    <p>But circumcision itself, Dr. Somerville suggested in a <a
    href="/library/ethics/somerville1/">letter</a> to the Journal,
    is not worth that pain, particularly since babies cannot give
    their consent to the procedure. "Was it ethical," she asked,
    for [the authors] to include a group of infants circumcised
    without anesthesia?" The letter inspired a wave of media
    interest in Dr. Somerville's views, and she has since been
    quoted as saying that circumcision "is technically a criminal
    assault" under the Criminal Code definition which covers any
    medically unjustified "intentional wounding." Only Muslims and
    Jews, she thinks, should be exempt from prosecution for having
    their babies's foreskins removed.</p>

    <p>Dr. Somerville--who does not favor criminal prosecution "at
    this time"--says that the onus is on parents to show that
    circumcision provides medical benefits. That issue has been the
    subject of three decades of furious scientific debate, and no
    consensus has emerged. A 1996 study by the Canadian Paediatric
    Society (CPS) concluded that "the overall evidence...is so
    evenly balanced that it does not support recommending
    circumcision as a routine procedure." Circumcision reduces the
    incidence of urinary tract infections twelvefold, but only 1%
    or 2% ever get such infections, and under 2% of infection
    patients suffer complications.</p>

    <p>Dr. Doug McMillan, chairman of the CPS Fetus and Newborn
    Committee, says that although the report did not support
    routine circumcision, he believed the decision is best left
    with parents. "There are other things that parents authorize
    that can have bad consequences," note the University of Calgary
    medical professor, citing pierced ears as an example. "But we
    have to believe that the majority of parents make the best
    choice they can. Our role is to give them information to make
    that choice.</p>

    <p>Parents who inquire will not find clear answers in the
    medical literature. Studies have indicated that the organisms
    which cause sexually transmitted diseases (including AIDS) can
    be trapped and incubated under the foreskin, but
    anti-circumcisionists counter that proper hygiene eliminates
    this problem. Some doctors say circumcision lowers the
    incidence of penile cancer; others say it increases it. Some
    studies have even suggested that the pain of circumcision
    somehow inhibits mother-son bonding.</p>

    <p>Marilyn Milos is founder of the National Organization of
    Circumcision Information Resource Centers (NOCIRC) which is
    based in San Anselmo, California. She says that on newborn
    males, the foreskin is connected to the tip of the penis by a
    thin membrane. "They literally have to tear the foreskin from
    the glans," often scarring the flesh in the process. She says,
    "It's like peeling an orange." This is so painful she claims,
    that it does permanent psychological damage. "Until I got in
    touch with my circumcision," one man told her recently, "I
    always wondered why I had this vague sense of terror."</p>

    <p>Dr. McMillan admits that a 1995 study by Toronto researchers
    found that circumcised infants are more sensitive to the pain
    of vaccinations. But to connect that to psychological problems
    later in life "open to a lot of question," he says. Dr. Aaron
    Jesin, a Jewish physician from Toronto who performs both
    regular and ritual circumcisions, adds that the procedure is
    not as ghastly as its opponents say. "The whole thing takes 30
    seconds or less," he says. "Some babies need pain medication
    and some don't and usually they calm down very quickly." Dr.
    Jesin also points out that 10% to 15% of males not circumcised
    at birth must undergo the procedure later in life for problems
    like phimosis (inability to retract the foreskin) and
    balano-posthitis (inflammation of the foreskin and glans).</p>

    <p>Jews and Muslims believe that God commands them to
    circumcise their sons as symbol of the promise made to Abraham
    that he would become the "father of a multitude of nations."
    Circumcision became common in Christian society in the 1800s,
    says NOCIRC's Milos. Victorian doctors recommended circumcision
    as a way to prevent masturbation, which was associated with
    impotence, imbecility, insanity, blindness, consumption and
    other ailments.</p>

    <p>Modern medical evidence in favour of circumcision emerged
    later, but opposition to the practice was low-key until the mid
    1980s, says Ms. Milos. At that time, the gay community began to
    notice what other men had and didn't have. They began to
    acknowledge what had been done to them and they weren't afraid
    to talk about it. Now it's not just the gay community that's
    complaining."</p>

    <p>Many of these men are upset because they feel cheated in
    their sex life. Foreskins contain bundles of nerve endings,
    rather like lips, which may contribute to sexual satisfaction.
    Ms. Milos contends that the surface of the glans on circumcised
    males thickens and is therefore less sensitive. Dr. McMillan
    observes that surveys have shown no difference in sexual
    satisfaction between circumcised and uncircumcised males, but
    Ms. Milos is unfazed. "It's preposterous to think that you
    won't have a loss of sensation," she asserts. Consequently she
    contends that circumcision is a sexual rights issue---"an
    assault on a child's sexuality and a violation of his right to
    an intact body."</p>

    <p>Some men will do almost anything to get that "intact body"
    back. There are no statistics on exactly how many men have
    attempted foreskin restoration, either by stretching or
    surgery, but proponents insist it is increasingly common. For
    the do-it-yourselfer, <i>The Joy of Uncircumcising!</i> by
    California psychologist Jim Bigelow describes various methods
    involving different types of tape, weights and foam rubber
    cones.</p>

    <p>Ms. Milos reports that there have been several lawsuits
    launched against doctors in the U.S. over botched
    circumcisions. She knows of no cases where a son is sueing his
    parents, but, she asserts, "it'll happen."</p>
