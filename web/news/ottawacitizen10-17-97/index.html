            <h1>Circumcising baby boys 'criminal assault'</h1>

            <h2>Ethicist says society must consider ban</h2>

            <p><b>Sharon Kirkey</b><br />
            The Ottawa Citizen</p>

            <p>One of the country's leading medical ethicists says
            circumcision of baby boys is criminal assault and that
            doctors should stop doing it.</p>

            <p>"It's a bodily wounding on a tiny infant that has
            given no consent itself, and it is not a medically
            necessary (procedure)," Dr. Margaret Somerville,
            founding director of the McGill Centre for Medicine,
            Ethics and Law, said in an interview yesterday.</p>

            <p>And in a lead <a
            href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/337/8/568?fyear=1993"
            target="_blank">letter</a> published in a recent issue
            of the prestigious <a href="http://content.nejm.org/"
            target="_blank">New England Journal of Medicine</a>,
            Dr. Somerville and Montreal physician David Alwin say
            it's time the "cloak of medicine" surrounding male
            circumcision was removed.</p>

            <p>She said the medical profession must decide whether
            non-medical circumcision and research surrounding it
            should even be carried out.</p>

            <p>In an interview, Dr. Somerville went further and
            said society should start questioning whether there is
            any rationale for cutting away a newborn baby boy's
            healthy foreskin.</p>

            <p>"We as a society have to decide" whether to stop
            circumcisions, Dr. Somerville said.</p>

            <p>The Montreal ethicist has decided, "gradually and
            with some reluctance," to enter the intensifying debate
            over routine, non-medical male circumcision.</p>

            <p>"I know that you run a terrible risk of being
            thought to be anti-Semitic in talking against
            circumcision," Dr. Somerville said. (In the Jewish
            faith, circumcision is a religious ritual, and one
            which almost all Jews follow. It has also been
            practised for centuries by Muslims; however, most
            circumcisions in Canada are for non-religious reasons,
            according to the Circumcision Information Reference
            Centre in Montreal.)</p>

            <p>"We have to start from the basic presumption of the
            utmost respect for people's religious beliefs and
            traditions and rituals. I think we've had far too
            little respect for a lot of those," Dr. Somerville
            said.</p>

            <p>"But there's a point at which we also have the
            utmost duties to protect those unable to protect
            themselves. And sometimes that means that we have to
            trespass on those other things."</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Dr. Somerville says non-medical
            infant male circumcision is technically criminal
            assault.</span></p>

            <p>"It's a wounding, it's clearly a serious wounding --
            some kids die from this -- and the person hasn't given
            any consent themselves."</p>

            <p>A recent <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2/">study</a>
            by researchers at the <a
            href="http://www.sickkids.on.ca/"
            target="_blank">Hospital for Sick Children</a> in
            Toronto found that circumcising a newborn without first
            administering any painkillers -- which is normal
            practice in hospitals across Canada, including
            Ottawa-Carleton -- creates a lasting pain reflex in
            children. Infants who were circumcised showed
            significantly more pain when they received their
            childhood vaccinations.</p>

            <p>"If you're really looking at something that is
            traumatic enough that you've got to use anesthetic to
            do it, should you really be doing that on a newborn
            baby when it's not needed for his health or health
            care?" Dr. Somerville asked.</p>

            <p>"And should doctors be doing it? Is this an ethical
            practice of medicine? I don't think they should do it.
            I've reluctantly come to that conclusion."</p>

            <p>Circumcision, which is uncommon in Europe and Great
            Britain, is a largely North American phenomenon. In
            non-religious cases, it was considered a way to
            significantly reduce the risk of urinary tract
            infections, sexually transmitted diseases and penile
            cancer.</p>

            <p>Rates vary across Canada. In Ottawa, about one boy
            in two is circumcised; in Newfoundland, the procedure
            is almost never done.</p>

            <p>In some western provinces, including Alberta, a
            majority of boys are circumcised.</p>

            <p>The procedure involves cutting away the inner and
            outer layers of the foreskin. Minor complications, such
            as bleeding and infection, occur in between five to 10
            per cent of cases; in extremely rare cases, the
            procedure can result in damage to the penis, ranging
            from lacerations to permanent deformity or, in even
            rarer cases, amputation.</p>

            <p>Circumcision takes just minutes, "but there's no
            question it's painful, in case anyone thinks
            otherwise," says Dr. Robin Walker, chief of neonatology
            at the <a href="http://www.cheo.on.ca/"
            target="_blank">Children's Hospital of Eastern
            Ontario</a>.</p>

            <p>He is a member of a special committee of the <a
            href="http://www.cps.ca/">Canadian Pediatric
            Society</a> that last year issued a <a
            href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm"
            target="_blank">statement</a> saying there is no valid
            medical reason to justify routine infant male
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>The only benefit the committee found was a reduced
            risk of urinary tract infection, a condition that
            affects only one to two per cent of male infants and
            can be easily treated.</p>

            <p>There was some evidence that circumcision can reduce
            the risk of penile cancer, an extremely rare form of
            cancer that afflicts only 0.3 to 1.1 males per
            100,000.</p>

            <p>But ultimately, the committee found no real medical
            reason to justify male circumcision, except in rare
            cases -- for example, an abnormality of the foreskin
            that prevents urination.</p>

            <p>So why do doctors do it?</p>

            <p>"The short answer is because they're asked to," Dr.
            Walker said.</p>

            <p>"Certainly don't ask me to defend it. I don't do
            them. I will not do them. I don't do procedures that I
            don't consider to be medically indicated."</p>

            <p>"But it's not just that parents request it," Dr.
            Walker said. "They often demand in very forceful terms
            that the baby be circumcised.</p>

            <p>"I understand if it's a religious reason, that there
            is a clear reason why it would be very important to
            them. But where it is purely because dad had it or the
            brother had it or grandfather had it or we just want
            it, the emotions are very strong. People absolutely
            insist upon this."</p>

            <p>In fact, even though most provinces, including
            Ontario, have removed circumcisions from provincial
            health plans, parents are still willing to pay the $100
            fee. De-listing, Dr. Walker said, has had virtually no
            effect on circumcision rates.</p>

            <p>Dr. Walker said many pediatricians try to discourage
            circumcision when they talk to parents. But he said
            it's not unethical for doctors to perform what he says
            is considered, in non-religious cases, a cosmetic
            procedure.</p>

            <p>But anti-circumcision advocates say doctors have no
            right to remove normal tissue from a healthy individual
            without their consent.</p>

            <p>"The people who are the most responsible and who are
            the least accountable are doctors because they know
            better," says <a href="mailto:infocirc@total.net">John
            Antonopoulos</a>, president of the <a
            href="http://www.infocirc.org/index-e.htm"
            target="_blank">Circumcision Information Resource
            Centre</a>, a non-profit group in Montreal.</p>

            <p>He says the foreskin is a "normal, functional,
            healthy, helpful and erogenous" part of the penis that
            helps maintain the surface, texture and sensitivity of
            the glans.</p>

            <p>More and more men who were circumcised as infants
            are "feeling a sense of resentment that their right to
            their normal body, given that nothing was diseased,
            nothing needed to be removed, was violated, and
            permanently," he said.</p>

            <p>He said the debate isn't just a men's issue, or one
            of "men boo-hoo-hooing over their penises."</p>

            <p>In fact, one of the key people behind the
            anti-circumcision movement in the U.S. is a former <a
            href="http://www.nocirc.org/awardsspeech.html">nurse</a>
            who was fired when she started giving parents candid,
            up-to-date information on circumcisions. Debate is also
            building within the Jewish community and has started to
            surface in mainstream Jewish publications.</p>

            <p>Dr. Somerville says Canadians should re-examine male
            circumcisions with the same "open eyes" that the nation
            used to assess female genital mutilation, a practice
            that is now banned in Canada.</p>

            <p>"Maybe we have to have some sort of consultation to
            decide that this is not on," she said.</p>
