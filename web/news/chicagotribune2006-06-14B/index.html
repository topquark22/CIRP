            <h2>Expert: Circumcision no big deal</h2>

            <p>By Judy Peres<br />
             Tribune staff reporter<br />
             Published June 14, 2006, 9:48 PM CDT</p>

            <p>A medical expert testified Wednesday that
            circumcision would be less stressful for an 8-year-old
            boy than having to be treated for recurrent
            problems.</p>

            <p>Testifying in a dispute between divorced parents, <a
            href="http://www.luhs.org/depts/urology/html/hatch.htm"
            target="_blank">Dr. David Hatch</a> said he has
            performed about 400 circumcisions on boys age 5 to 10
            and has never seen any serious complications.</p>

            <p>Hatch, a pediatric urologist at <a
            href="http://www.luhs.org" target="_blank">Loyola
            University Medical Center</a>, Maywood, said the
            operation takes about an hour and most boys recover in
            5 to 10 days.</p>

            <p>"Circumcision on an 8-year-old child requires skill,
            but it is a rather uncomplicated procedure," he
            said.</p>

            <p>Hatch testified on the second day of a hearing
            before Cook County Circuit Judge Jordan Kaplan,
            appearing as an expert witness for the boy's mother,
            who is in favor of circumcision. The child's father is
            suing to prevent the operation.</p>

            <p>Tracy Rizzo, the mother's lawyer, asked Hatch about
            the <a href="/library/psych/">psychological risks</a>
            of the procedure on a boy this age.</p>

            <p>"They go through stress," Hatch said, "but I have no
            sense that they undergo long-term psychological
            damage." On the other hand, he said, "circumcision
            would decrease the suffering and trauma from repeat
            bouts of <a
            href="/library/disease/balanitis/">balanitis</a>," or
            inflammation of the tip of the penis.</p>

            <p>Under cross-examination by the father's lawyer, <a
            href="http://www.lawyers.com/lawyers/Atlanta/Georgia/David%20J.%20Llewellyn/attorney.html?a=0761-LDS&amp;co=&amp;b=A101006875805"
             target="_blank">David Llewellyn</a>, Hatch
            acknowledged that his recommendation was based largely
            on the mother's report that there had been multiple
            episodes of redness and discomfort.</p>

            <p>Llewellyn pointed out that the boy's medical chart
            in his pediatrician's office does not document
            recurrent balanitis or other abnormalities. The mother
            said there was only one episode in which the problem
            had been serious enough to take the boy to a
            doctor.</p>

            <p>When asked why she wanted her son circumcised, the
            mother said the bouts of inflammation were limiting his
            activity. "I don't want him to worry if he keeps his
            bathing suit on too long, or swims in a pool, or uses
            the wrong soap," she said.</p>

            <p>The mother also said she wanted the boy circumcised
            at birth, but her husband had refused, saying, "There's
            no way he's getting circumcised. He's not a Jew."</p>

            <p>The father denied that they had discussed
            circumcision. Both parents are Catholic immigrants from
            Eastern European countries where the procedure is rare
            except for religious reasons.</p>

            <p>Although the dispute purports to be about what is
            best for the child, much of Wednesday's testimony was
            devoted to sniping between the parents. Rizzo tried
            repeatedly to suggest the father was negligent and his
            motivation had nothing to do with the boy's health.</p>

            <p>The father's lawyer, for his part, implied that the
            mother's aim was to spite her ex-husband and please her
            current husband. The boy's stepfather is Jewish, and
            both the stepfather and his biological son are
            circumcised.</p>

            <p>No decision is expected until August.</p>
