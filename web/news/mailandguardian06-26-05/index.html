            <h2>'Surgeon' uses one knife to circumcise 28 boys</h2>
            Johannesburg, South Africa<br />
             <i>26 June 2005 07:40</i> 

            <p>A traditional circumcision surgeon was arrested and
            28 young boys rescued from his house in Libode in the
            Eastern Cape on Sunday, a spokesperson for the
            provincial health department said.</p>

            <p>"The suspect allegedly used one unsterilised knife
            to circumcise all the boys," Sizwe Khuphelo said.</p>

            <p>The initiates, aged between 14 and 17, were treated
            at St Barnabes hospital in Libode.</p>

            <p>Khupelo said five boys had died at various
            circumcision schools in the Eastern Cape since the
            start of initiation season two weeks ago.</p>

            <p>The department has closed down 20 illegal
            initiations schools and arrested 14 traditional
            surgeons since the start of the season.</p>

            <p>"Since Friday we have arrested nine traditional
            surgeons and traditional nurses," Khupelo said.</p>

            <p>"We also rescued more than 80 boy since Friday at
            various schools."</p>

            <p>Khupelo said the community apprehended a traditional
            surgeon who circumcised more than 40 boys using one
            blade.</p>

            <p>He said one surgeon was arrested on Friday in Port
            St Johns.</p>

            <p>Another was arrested in Libode on Wednesday. The
            arrests are part of the continuing clampdown on
            initiation schools in the province.</p>

            <p>"The department is using 420 officials around the
            province to monitor the situation in the province,"
            Khupelo said. - Sapa</p>
