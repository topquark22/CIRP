            <h2>Nurses Condemn Circumcision</h2>

            <p>The routine circumcision of male babies was
            condemned by the province's registered nurses at their
            annual convention in Vancouver.</p>

            <p>The preamble of a resolution passed by a majority of
            nurses said male circumcision is a procedure without
            demonstrable medical benefits in the vast majority of
            cases. The procedure is also <a
            href="/library/statements/cps1975/">not recommended</a>
            by the <a href="http://www.cps.ca/"
            target="_blank">Canadian Paediatric Society</a>.</p>

            <p>The nurses also agreed Friday that routine
            circumcision has numerous complications that are rarely
            communicated to parents, and that most medical
            authorities worldwide believe newborn males have a
            right to remain intact except in rare instances.</p>

            <p>And they believe nurses have a role to play in
            educating parents about the perils of circumcision.</p>

            <p>The resolution was introduced at the convention by
            the New Westminster chapter of the <a
            href="http://www.rnabc.bc.ca/"
            target="_blank">Registered Nurses' Association of
            B.C.</a> Before being passed, it was amended to include
            both sexes. The phrase &ldquo;routine infant male
            circumcision&rdquo; was replaced with
            &ldquo;non-therapeutic circumcision.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;It's circumcision of all forms on all sexes
            and so it makes it quite open,&rdquo; Iva Phillips, a
            registered nurse from Victoria, said Sunday. ``And what
            it emphasizes is the role of the nurses and the
            association in raising awareness regarding this
            procedure.''</p>

            <p>Last year, the issue proved too controversial and a
            similar resolution was withdrawn.</p>

            <p>John Cox said Sunday the resolution passed Friday
            asked the board of directors and individual members of
            the nurses' association to help raise public awareness
            about the risks of non-therapeutic circumcision.</p>

            <p>It also asked the board of directors and the <a
            href="http://www.cna-nurses.ca/cna/"
            target="_blank">Canadian Nurses' Association</a> to
            develop positions regarding the role of nurses in
            non-therapeutic circumcision, said Cox, director of
            public relations for the nurses' association.</p>

            <p>Said Cox: &ldquo;I am sure that there will be some
            kind of a statement made that will clarify what the
            nurses' role is and this will, I think, help create a
            higher level of understanding.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>The board of directors is expected to consider the
            resolution at its next meeting June 8.</p>
