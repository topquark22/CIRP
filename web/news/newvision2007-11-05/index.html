            <h2>ABC, not circumcision, gives best defence against
            HIV</h2>
            Monday, 5th November, 2007 

            <p>By David J. Llewellyn</p>

            <p>Dr. Myers Lugemwa is to be congratulated on his
            insightful article on the attempt to circumcise Uganda
            by US doctors. It is so obvious that Abstinence, Being
            Faithful and Condoms (ABC) are the only rational
            defense against the HIV virus, that it is hard to
            believe that many in the international health community
            have bought into the ridiculous "circumcise to prevent
            HIV" theory.<br />
            <br />
             The best way to prevent sexually-transmitted HIV and
            all other venereal diseases is by ABC. It is that
            simple.<br />
            <br />
             It appears that there may be more to the push for
            circumcision than merely the improvement of public
            health. Some of those pushing this strategy have their
            academic reputations and careers on the line. Others
            have familial traditions that emphasise circumcision.
            For example, Daniel Halperin, one of the foremost
            proponents of the "circumcise to prevent HIV" movement,
            admitted in a newspaper article years ago that his
            grandfather had been a part-time Jewish ritual
            circumciser. He has also been quoted as saying that
            women like circumcised men and that sex is better if
            you are circumcised &mdash; two very subjective
            statements with which most uncircumcised men and their
            wives would disagree. Others may feel the need to
            validate their own circumcised status or academic
            theories by encouraging others to be circumcised.<br />
            <br />
             Two of the primary authors of the recent randomised
            controlled trials recently have collaborated with
            long-time proponents of circumcision on the formulation
            of a pamphlet encouraging women worldwide to push their
            husbands to be circumcised and to circumcise their
            sons. One of those proponents, a circumcised
            middle-aged Australian, the primary author of the
            pamphlet, has written that circumcision is "an
            imperative" for the 21st Century!<br />
            <br />
             As the Trojans learned, one should always "beware of
            Greeks bearing gifts," even if those "Greeks" are
            Americans. Ugandans should know that one of the early
            proponents of medicalised circumcision in the US, Peter
            Remondino, M.D., in the late 19th Century advocated
            circumcising all black Americans to prevent what he
            called "the Negro rape crisis."<br />
            <br />
             Modern day Ugandans may wish to consider whether or
            not the US push to circumcise them has any similar
            patronising, racist overtones or overtones of
            colonialism.<br />
            <br />
             We know that the foreskin is an integral part of the
            penis. A recent study has shown that it is the most
            sensitive part of the penis. Earlier unrefuted studies
            proved that it contains most of the fine touch nerve
            receptors in the penis. It may well mediate the
            ejaculatory reflex.<br />
            <br />
             It makes intercourse easier and more enjoyable for
            both the man and the woman. No rational man would give
            up his foreskin if he realised the sexual consequences.
            It is immoral and unethical to remove normal,
            sexually-valuable tissue from an infant or child, male
            or female, without present medical necessity. Ugandans
            should think twice about what they would be losing
            before agreeing to circumcision for themselves or their
            sons.<br />
            <br />
             That Americans may still circumcise the majority of
            their sons is not an example to emulate.<br />
            <br />
             As Dr. Lugemwa points out, circumcision began in the
            US in a vain attempt to prevent masturbation. Of
            course, it did not work. But Americans became invested
            with their circumcised penises and it has proven
            challenging to change their minds. Nevertheless,
            Ugandans should know that the rate of circumcision in
            the US has been dropping slowly for the last 30 years
            as the public has learned of the value of the foreskin.
            In California and some other western states, the
            circumcision rate for newborn boys is below 35%.<br />
            <br />
             Ugandans should also know that circumcision did not
            prevent HIV from wrecking havoc in the US. The US has a
            much higher rate of HIV infection and a much higher
            rate of circumcision than does Europe. This puts the
            lie to the hypothesis that circumcision "prevents" HIV.
            It is not a "vaccine," although its proponents would
            like Ugandans to believe that it is. One might
            reasonably wonder what the real motive is behind those
            who would try to sell a mutilating surgery to others
            with such hyperbole.<br />
            <br />

            controversy surrounding male circumcision might wish to
