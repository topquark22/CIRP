            <p><b>Polly Curtis, health correspondent<br />
             Saturday February 17, 2007<br />
             The Guardian</b></p>

            <p>Police have launched an investigation into the
            "unexplained" death of a newborn baby who suffered a
            heart attack minutes after he was circumcised in a
            north London synagogue.</p>

            <p>Eight-day old Amitai Moshe went into cardiac arrest
            15 minutes after the operation was performed and died
            eight days later. The <a
            href="http://www.met.police.uk/"
            target="_blank">Metropolitan Police</a>'s serious crime
            directorate is leading an investigation into his
            death.</p>

            <p>A police spokesman said he was taken to the <a
            href="http://www.royalfree.org.uk/"
            target="_blank">Royal Free Hospital</a> by the Hatzola
            ambulance service at about 8.25am on February 1. He was
            later transferred to <a href=""
            target="_blank">University College Hospital</a>, where
            he died on February 9.</p>

            <p>An initial postmortem examination found the baby
            suffered a cardiac arrest and oxygen starvation to the
            brain. The cause of death has not been confirmed and
            police are treating the death as unexplained, the
            spokesman said.</p>

            <p>He added: "Inquiries are being carried out by
            officers from the specialist crime directorate to
            establish the circumstances that led to the child
            becoming ill. His death is being treated as unexplained
            at this early stage."</p>

            <p>The Bris Milah ceremony was carried out by a
            registered practitioner of circumcision, known as a
            <i>Mohel</i>, at <a href="http://www.ggbh.org.uk/"
            target="_blank">Golders Green United Synagogue</a>.</p>

            <p>The rabbi of the synagogue, Harvey Belovsky, said:
            "It goes without saying that our main task has been to
            provide all the support and sensitivity possible to the
            family at this time. As a rabbi, it is reassuring for
            me to see that they feel so helped by the members of
            our congregation, who have rallied to its side
            throughout this extremely trying and difficult
            period."</p>

            <p>A spokesman for the <a href="http://www.bod.org.uk/"
            target="_blank">Board of Deputies of British Jews</a>
            said: "No causal connection has been established
            between the circumcision and Amitai's death. It was
            carried out by a mohel who is a registered member of
            the Initiation Society, which has been regulating and
            training them for over 200 years. Over 2,000
            circumcisions of baby boys are carried out in Britain
            every year. It is a very regulated practice in terms of
            medical training. This was an unfortunate juxtaposition
            of two events."</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.initiationsociety.org/"
            target="_blank">Initiation Society</a> recorded 2,000
            circumcisions last year - but many more are carried
            out. One in 10 teenagers is circumcised. Circumcision
            is common among Muslim communities, and in some areas
            it is available on the NHS. Serious complications are
            very rare.</p>

            <p>Some doctors argue there is no strong medical
            evidence to support routine circumcision, particularly
            as it is known the baby experiences pain, though others
            recognise the religious and cultural importance of the
            practice. Su-Anna Boddy, a consultant paediatric
            urologist at <a href="http://www.stgeorges.nhs.uk/"
            target="_blank">St George's hospital</a> in London,
            said it was likely local anaesthetic would have been
            used. "To my opinion and knowledge, the Jewish faith
            needs this to be done and have an excellent way of
            doing it."</p>

            <p>David Smith, general manager of <a
            href="http://www.norm-uk.org/" target="_blank">Norm
            UK</a>, a registered charity which campaigns for
            circumcision to only be performed for adults who can
            give consent, said: <span class="yellow">"Medical
            opinion is that this is a damaging procedure. We feel
            only people who can chose should be given
            circumcisions."</span></p>
