            <h2>Death from the Operation of Circumcision</h2>

            <p>Coroner Hills was summoned yesterday to hold an
            inquest at No. 384 Eighth street, upon the body of
            Julius Katzenstein, a child nine days old, who died the
            previous day.<br />
            <br />
             Monohan Katzenstein, father of deceased, deposed that
            the child was born last Friday week, and did well up to
            Friday last when it was circumcised by Dr. Simeon
            Abrahams; soon after the operation bleeding began, and
            continued until Sunday, when the child died; none of
            the child's clothes were removed after the operation
            till Saturday morning at 8 o'clock.<br />
            <br />
             Dr. Abrahams testified thus: "I have performed the
            operation of circumcision several thousand times; it is
            not customary to see the child after the operation, but
            it is necessary to have the child washed in an hour or
            so afterwards in order to keep it clean, this was not
            done in this case; I performed the operation entirely
            in the usual manner; in my opinion the child was
            prematurely born, and being neglected by the parents,
            died in consequence of these two causes.<br />
            <br />
             Drs. Frankel and Stell who examined the child, gave it
            as their opinion that the operation of circumcision was
            properly performed.<br />
            <br />
             The Jury reported the following Verdict:<br />
            <br />
             "That the said infant came to his death by loss of
            blood from the operation of circumcision and subsequent
            neglect, through ignorance on the part of the
            parents."</p>
