      <p>A retired surgeon who botched circumcision operations on
      two baby boys has been found guilty of abusing his
      professional position. The <a href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/"
      target="_blank">General Medical Council</a> decided that
      obstetrician Mr Peter Silverstone had acted inappropriately
      and irresponsibly.</p>

      <table align="right" summary="photo of Mr Peter Silverstone">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th align="center"><img src="silverstone.png"
            alt="Mr Peter Silverstone" /></th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th align="center"><small>Mr Peter Silverstone carried
            out the operations</small></th>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>It has also ruled that the GP who referred the boys on had
      similarly abused his position.</p>

      <p>A GMC <a
      href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/probdocs/probdoc_frameset.htm"
      target="_blank">disciplinary hearing</a> heard that Mr
      Silverstone, of Newcastle upon Tyne, failed to <a
      href="/library/statements/gmc/">properly anaesthetise</a> the
      six and seven month old children during the operations which
      were carried out in 1998.</p>

      <p><b>Howled in pain</b></p>

      <p>One infant howled in pain throughout the 25 minute
      procedure, and the other bled for hours afterwards.</p>

      <p>Zoe Johnson from the GMC said that Mr Silverstone was not
      sufficiently expert in the procedure.</p>

      <table align="right" summary="photo of Dr Michael Harbinson">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th align="center"><img src="harbinson.png"
            alt="Dr Michael Harbinson" /></th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th align="center"><small>Dr Michael Harbinson referred
            the boys to Mr Silverstone</small></th>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>While he had carried out religious circumcisions, he was
      not experienced in carrying them out for medical reasons.</p>

      <p>The GMC also found against GP Dr Michael Harbinson, of
      Rowlands Gill, Tyne and Wear, who referred the babies'
      mothers to the surgeon.</p>

      <p>The hearing heard that Dr Harbinson had pressurised one of
      the mothers into agreeing to the surgery, presenting the
      option of circumcision as a fait accompli.</p>

      <p>The hearing will now consider whether the doctors are
      guilty of serious professional misconduct.</p>
