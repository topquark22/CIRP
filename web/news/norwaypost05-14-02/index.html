      <h2>Offensive against sex mutilation</h2>

      <p><b>The authorities have launched a number of measures
      aimed at preventing circumcision or sex mutilation of girls
      with immigrant background.</b></p>

      <p>Two Somali girls will travel around to multicultural
      schools and inform the students about the ban against sex
      mutilation of girls.</p>

      <p>Sex mutilation is forbidden in Norway, and complicity in
      such an operation may lead to up to 8 years in prison.</p>

      <p>Family Minister Laila Daavoey points to the fact that
      summer vacation is a time when many youngsters are sent out
      of the country to beccome married against their own will or
      to be circumcized.</p>

      <p>The Government will therefore run an information campaign
      at the schools until summer vacation begins. And the
      organization African Youth will be passing out information to
      travellers at the Gardermoen Airport in June.</p>

      <p>-Young people must become aware of their rights to refuse
      to go along with such infringements, and at the same time
      become aware of the fact that society will give them the
      necessary help and support, says Daavoey.</p>

      <p>The information will also be given to newly arrived
      immigrants and refugees.</p>
