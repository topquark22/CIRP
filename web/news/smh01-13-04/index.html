            <p class="pic"><b>It's Indonesia's biggest secret. Most
            of its women have been subjected to an operation which
            the World Health Organisation says is unnecessary.
            Matthew Moore and Karuni Rompies report.</b></p>

            <p>Hospitals across Indonesia are offering new parents
            a one-price surgical package for their just-born girls
            - when they pierce their ears, they'll circumcise the
            girls as well.</p>

            <p class="pic">At Jakarta's Hermina Hospital the price
            for the two procedures is Rp95,000 (about $16); at IDI
            hospital in Surabaya in East Java it's only Rp15,000,
            while in Makassar's Khadijah Hospital in Sulawesi,
            hospital staff quote Rp25,000 to Rp30,000.</p>

            <p class="pic">In some hospitals and health care
            centres, vaccinations are included in the package as
            modern medicine - attracting parents with the
            convenience of a one-stop shop - takes over a field
            long occupied by village-based healers.</p>

            <p>While hospitals might be more hygienic, health care
            experts are worried by strong evidence that the move
            has led to more of the child's genital tissue being cut
            because doctors use different implements and
            techniques.</p>

            <p>Village midwives and traditional healers have been
            circumcising girls in Indonesia for centuries, although
            the extent and details of the practice are only now
            emerging.</p>

            <p>Two major studies were published last year, and the
            most comprehensive - <a
            href="http://216.239.53.104/search?q=cache:d4IG7Kc48ycJ:www.dec.org/pdf_docs/PNACU138.pdf+%22Female+Circumcision+in+Indonesia%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8">
            <i>Female Circumcision in Indonesia</i></a>, by the
            Indonesian branch of the <a
            href="http://www.popcouncil.org/"
            target="_blank">Population Council</a>, an
            international non-government organisations - raised
            concerns about the move to hospitals'
            "medicalisation".</p>

            <p>"Many maternity clinic midwives have begun to market
            female cutting (FC) as part of a birth delivery package
            with the service being offered to the parents right
            after the delivery of a baby girl," the report
            says.</p>

            <p>"The danger of medicalisation of FC lies in the fact
            that midwives tend to use scissors instead of
            penknives, and thus the tools used are for real cutting
            of the clitoris (incision and excision) where
            traditional providers more often use penknives for more
            symbolic acts of scraping or rubbing."</p>

            <p>While circumcision is widespread in Indonesia, it is
            very different to the female genital mutilation (FGC)
            common in parts of Africa, which often severely damages
            almost all genital parts.</p>

            <p>A professor of demography at the <a
            href="http://www.anu.edu.au/"
            target="_blank">Australian National University</a>, Dr
            Terry Hull, worked on both studies and first came
            across female circumcision in Indonesia 30 years ago
            when he lived in a village outside Yogyakarta while
            researching infant mortality.</p>

            <p>He learnt that symbolic circumcision involved local
            healers cutting a tumeric root and rubbing it on the
            baby's clitoris while those attending chanted and
            prayed. "This was very much women's business, and even
            if the fathers of the girls were there they would not
            understand what was done," he says.</p>

            <p>In the cities, where Islamic influence was stronger,
            Hull found that circumcision involved drawing blood,
            usually by putting a pin in the clitoris.</p>

            <p>Despite these and other related practices, Hull says
            that in Java at the time there was "universal denial"
            that circumcision of females took place. Even now, he
            says, there was a dearth of information because it was
            deemed too sensitive a topic to be discussed, or
            surveyed by government departments. Mothers had told
            him they did not know how much flesh had been removed
            from their babies during circumcision because they
            often did not look.</p>

            <p>Dyah Agusmunwati, 36, cited "tradition, religion and
            health" as the reasons for circumcising her daughter
            soon after giving birth in a Jakarta hospital, but was
            vague on the details. "I don't even have any idea of
            which part of my daughter was cut. She was circumcised
            when she was a day or two days old, I guess."</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">To find out more about female
            circumcision, the USAid-funded study by the Population
            Council surveyed 1694 households in eight regions and
            found all the boys and 97.5 per cent of girls had been
            circumcised.</span></p>

            <p>Although many questions remain unanswered, the study
            concluded circumcision in Indonesia at present "did not
            reveal any clear, immediate or long-term physical or
            psychological complications ... for girls or women". It
            listed the most common forms of circumcision as
            "rubbing and scraping; stretching, pricking and
            piercing; incision; and excision", and the cutting
            instruments used as "penknife; scissors; bamboo
            knife/razor blade and needles".</p>

            <p>While blades of some sort have long been used,
            traditional practitioners used a knife only to rub or
            scrape in a symbolic exercise that often did not draw
            blood. The concern is that circumcisions in hospitals
            are changing that because health professionals use
            scissors in more than 75 per cent of cases and using
            scissors invariably means cutting flesh. "Where
            scissors were used, cutting was almost always involved
            including incision (22 per cent) and excision (72 per
            cent)," the report said.</p>

            <p>"One midwife in Padang [West Sumatra] described how
            she usually cuts the clitoris, either directly or by
            pinching it first with tweezers, and then cutting the
            tip with scissors. Another said she only scratches the
            clitoris."</p>

            <p>Betadine is widely used after the procedures, and
            infection has not emerged as a major problem.</p>

            <p>Because of the wide variation in procedures, the
            report could not say how much (if any) flesh was
            usually removed but concluded that where tissue was
            excised it was generally a tiny amount.</p>

            <p>It's not only babies who are circumcised: a third of
            those surveyed were circumcised between the ages five
            and nine, and some were even older.</p>

            <p>SEVERAL hours out of Jakarta, in Bandung, the
            Assalaam Foundation has held free mass circumcisions
            for males and females for almost 50 years. As many as
            400 people turn up.</p>

            <p>Syarief Hamid, treasurer of the foundation, which
            also runs several schools, says the circumcisions were
            timed to honour the Prophet's birthday and were growing
            in popularity each year. While religion was the main
            reason for circumcisions, he says there are also health
            reasons. "I understand that a girl who is not
            circumcised would not have clean genitals after she
            urinates and sometimes that can cause cervical cancer,"
            he says. "The religious view is, if you are not
            circumcised you won't have clean genitals after you
            urinate. If then you pray, your prayer won't be
            legal."</p>

            <p>The practitioners who came from the local hospital
            always cut a piece off the clitoris, he says. Most of
            those who were circumcised were babies, but older
            people come, too. "Sometimes there are also women of 20
            or 30. Even grandmothers aged 50 or 60 years old come."
            Those who had the procedure described it as "like an
            ant bite".</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.depkes.go.id/"
            target="_blank">Department of Health</a> had come to
            observe, with representatives of the <a
            href="http://www.who.int/en/" target="_blank">World
            Health Organisation</a>, and had left satisfied. "What
            they saw here was different to what they imagined; it
            was different to what they saw in Africa," Syarief
            says. While there's a clear religious reason set out in
            the Koran for Muslim boys to be circumcised there's no
            such imperative for girls and Muslim leaders,
            practitioners and parents all struggle to provide clear
            answers on why they circumcise girls.</p>

            <p>Religion was the reason cited by 55 per cent of
            mothers surveyed, although none could identify parts of
            the Koran or the Prophet Guidance called Hadith where
            circumcision of girls was stipulated. Thirty-two per
            cent nominated health and hygiene as the perceived
            benefit and 9 per cent said they did not know what
            benefit it would bring their daughters.</p>

            <p>Masitoh Chusnan, from the women's wing of <a
            href="http://www.muhammadiyah.org.sg/"
            target="_blank">Muhammadiyah</a>, one of Indonesia's
            two biggest Muslim organisations, says the circumcision
            of girls is regarded in Islam as an honourable
            practice. "The Hadith did not say it's obligatory, but
            it is recommended to have it done," she says. "There is
            the Prophet's words saying girls must be circumcised
            but you should not cut too much."</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Dr Laura Guarenti, the WHO's
            reproductive health representative in Indonesia, said
            the WHO's position was of no acceptance of any genital
            cutting in medical institutions.</span> Although there
            was not a complete picture of female circumcision in
            Indonesia, she was concerned about the move to
            hospitals.</p>

            <p>"The danger of medication is when you have an
            instrument - it's easier to use scissors and it can be
            harmful." Guarenti, a gynaecologist with extensive
            experience in the practice in Africa, said circumcision
            was an issue that could only be addressed by Indonesian
            women, not by outsiders.</p>

            <p>"People should not judge this. It should be
            clarified by Indonesians, not by us. I am absolutely
            against any female circumcision but it's the women here
            who have to do something. If it's just a ritual, it's
            not necessarily a horrible thing just because the
            genitals are touched."</p>

            <p>While the report concludes there is no evidence of
            damage to girls who are circumcised, that it is done
            without the consent of the child, and without clear
            health benefits or religious mandate, was enough to
            classify it as a violation of human rights, according
            to the Population Council report. The practice could be
            seen to violate the rights of the child as stated under
            the <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-convention/">
            Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>, ratified by
            Indonesia in 1990.</p>

            <p>Whether that's the case or not, the practice shows
            no signs of declining in popularity - more than 90 per
            cent of mothers questioned supported the practice
            continuing. And one in five mothers even suggested
            social sanctions should be imposed on girls who were
            uncircumcised.</p>
