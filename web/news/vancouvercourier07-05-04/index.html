            <p><b>The unkindest cut</b></p>

            <p>By Jessica Werb&mdash;contributing writer</p>

            <p>When choosing a cause, activist James Loewen didn't
            take the easy route. Not for this man the company of
            earnest environmentalists, vegetarians or tree huggers;
            his is an altogether more lonely existence. The
            50-year-old Vancouver-based photographer is, as he
            terms himself, an "intactivist." To put it bluntly,
            Loewen wants male circumcision banned.</p>

            <p>"We have a law in Canada that prohibits any kind of
            tampering with female children's genitalia, and I
            believe that law is biased in that it doesn't protect
            all children," says Loewen, matter-of-factly. "What our
            society is very resistant to is understanding that the
            motivations behind male circumcision and the
            motivations behind female circumcision are very, very
            similar."</p>

            <p>For just about anyone who has heard the horror
            stories about the sub-Saharan practice of female
            circumcision-more often termed female genital
            mutilation-Loewen's statement is difficult to swallow.
            The brutality and violation of basic human rights that
            accompany the removal, with a blunt razor blade, of a
            young girl's external genitalia, including her clitoris
            and labia, cannot be denied. Can this gory,
            excruciating and dehumanizing ritual really be put in
            the same category as the simple snip, under medical
            supervision, of a male infant's foreskin?</p>

            <p>For Loewen and the small but steadily growing number
            of other intactivists worldwide, the question is a
            non-issue. Both procedures, they maintain, constitute
            an abuse of children's rights.</p>

            <p>"[Male and female circumcision] are both based on
            myth-the myth that the person is somehow benefiting
            from having this operation, and that the person is
            somehow cleansed," Loewen says.</p>

            <p>Until recently, such statements wouldn't garner more
            than a raised eyebrow or a nervous giggle. But with the
            release of a <a
            href="http://www.circumstitions.com/death-exsang.html"
            target="_blank">coroner's report</a> this past February
            into the death of one-month-old Ryleigh McWillis of
            Penticton, many parents and medical practitioners are
            taking a closer look at the practice of
            circumcision.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/theprovince08-29-02/">Ryleigh
            McWillis bled to death in August 2002, following a
            routine circumcision</a>. His parents, Tanna and Brent
            McWillis, were not given any follow-up information
            after the procedure, and were unaware that anything was
            awry. When Ryleigh's diaper filled with blood by 5 a.m.
            the morning after the operation, his parents rushed him
            to the hospital. It was too late. Blood transfusions,
            saline and antibiotics were not enough to save
            Ryleigh's life, and the previously healthy, normal baby
            died two days after his circumcision.</p>

            <p>The McWillis family, moving to Vernon after the
            tragedy, was disappointed with the coroner's report,
            which found that <a
            href="http://www.penticton.ca/eds/hospital/page1.html"
            target="_blank">Penticton Regional Hospital</a>, where
            Ryleigh was circumcised, had significantly improved its
            circumcision education and follow-up care. The media
            onslaught on the grieving family members following the
            tragedy has made them wary of speaking to reporters,
            and they declined an interview with the <i>Courier</i>.
            <a href="/news/theprovince02-13-04/">Tanna McWillis has
            said that she would circumcise another child</a>, but
            that hasn't stopped others from using Ryleigh's tragic
            death as a call to arms against circumcision.</p>

            <p>"Babies die every year of circumcision, of what's
            totally unnecessary," says Dr. George Denniston, the
            Port Townsend, Wash.-based founder and president of <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>. For
            Denniston and other anti-circumcision lobbyists,
            fatalities aren't a complication -they're the extreme
            outcome of an abnormal, unnecessary surgery.</p>

            <p>"Every circumcision is a complication," Denniston
            insists. "You're taking off normal body parts, and so
            you're depriving someone of a normal body part. That's
            the complication."</p>

            <p>(You can't speak of complications without mentioning
            the fate of 38-year-old David Reimer, whose botched
            circumcision in Winnipeg almost four decades ago led to
            the loss of his penis and a gender re-assignment by
            Baltimore's Dr. John Money in the notorious John/Joan
            case. Reimer, who committed suicide in mid-May, was
            raised as a girl at the recommendation of his doctors,
            who hailed the experiment a success. But in his teenage
            years, he discovered what had happened to him and began
            living as a male. He eventually married and took on the
            role of stepfather to three children. He committed
            suicide after becoming separated from his wife and lost
            his job.)</p>

            <p>The rate of circumcision in Canada currently sits at
            around 17 per cent, according to figures from the <a
            href="http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/splash.html"
            target="_blank">Canadian Institute for Health
            Information</a>. That's much lower than it was before
            Canada's provincial health authorities-with the
            exception of Manitoba-gradually stopped funding the
            procedure between 1984 and 1997. When the operation was
            publicly funded, about 60 per cent of newborn males
            were circumcised, with rates as high as 80 per cent in
            English Canada. In the U.S., where circumcision is
            funded through Medicaid and private insurance
            companies, the rate remains higher, at 60 per cent,
            according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p>

            <p>While Judaism and Islam command followers to
            circumcise male children, the majority of babies being
            circumcised in Canada are given the procedure for other
            reasons, some of which their parents find difficult to
            articulate.</p>

            <p>"I think it was very important to my husband,
            because he's circumcised... I don't know why it was so
            important to him," admits 29-year-old nurse Karen
            Tetrault of Abbotsford, whose three sons have all been
            circumcised by Dr. Neil Pollock, a Vancouver physician
            whose practice focuses solely on circumcision and
            no-scalpel, no-needle vasectomies. Dr. Pollock provides
            his services through Pollock Clinics, which has four
            locations throughout Greater Vancouver.</p>

            <p>Tetrault's youngest, five week-old Tyler, was
            circumcised just a few weeks ago. She says Dr.
            Pollock's procedure, which she wouldn't allow her GP to
            perform, assuaged any fears she had about pain for her
            child. Tyler didn't even cry during his circumcision.
            "For me, my husband is done, and it's important for the
            boys to look like their dad," Tetrault says, after some
            reflection. "If they see Daddy change, they might
            think, 'Hey, why am I different?'... Once I'd done one,
            then the decision was made to do all of them. If I had
            kept my littlest one not circumcised, it would have
            been mean, because Dad and his brothers would have
            been. I don't think that would have been right."</p>

            <p>Pollock, who is also a mohel-the title for someone
            certified to provide circumcision in a Jewish ceremony
            called a bris-says that while he doesn't take sides on
            circumcision, there are plenty of health benefits to
            the procedure. According to Pollock, the list includes
            a reduced risk of cervical cancer in female sexual
            partners, lower risk of cancer to the penis, fewer
            urinary tract infections, a lower risk of HIV infection
            and other STDs, and less risk of sexual dysfunction
            later in life.</p>

            <p>These claims are all supported by numerous studies.
            More than a decade ago, studies in leading medical
            journals <i>Lancet</i> and <i>New England Journal of
            Medicine</i> reported that uncircumcised men were more
            likely to acquire heterosexual HIV. Many more studies
            since then have found similar results, leading to the
            theory that the foreskin can tear easily during
            intercourse, leaving mini-abrasions through which the
            HIV virus-and others-can enter. Recently, it's been
            shown that certain specialized cells in the foreskin,
            Langerhans cells, can trap the HIV virus and promote
            infection.</p>

            <p>In addition, says Pollock, infant circumcision
            eliminates the need to do circumcision later in life as
            a result of problems like recurrent "balanitis" or
            inflammation of the glans, infection, or
            "phimosis"-constriction of the foreskin. The later a
            circumcision is done, the more costly, painful and
            risky it is.</p>

            <p>As for the question of inflicting pain on an infant,
            Pollock, who performs close to 2,000 circumcisions a
            year, says he has devised a method of painless
            circumcision using topical freezing creams and local
            anesthetics. He also says his technique takes just 40
            seconds, compared to conventional techniques that can
            take up to 20 minutes.</p>

            <p>Trisha McConnell, a 20-year-old Wal-Mart customer
            service manager in North Vancouver, also had her
            one-month-old circumcised at the Pollock Clinic. One
            day after the procedure, she says that although it was
            initially frightening, she doesn't think her son was in
            much distress.</p>

            <p>"At first, they had to strap his legs down so he
            wouldn't kick, and just the look of it upset me a bit.
            But then they gave him gauze with brown sugar in it and
            they dipped it in juice. A sugar pacifier, they call
            it. He was crying, but as soon as he got the sugar, he
            stopped. Last night, I think it hurt him to pee the
            first couple of times, but today it doesn't because
            he's peed a lot and he hasn't cried about it."</p>

            <p>McConnell, like Tetrault, says she decided to have
            her son circumcised because her husband has had the
            procedure. She had also heard about the health
            benefits, and didn't think Bradly would suffer from any
            loss of sensitivity later in life.</p>

            <p>But the foreskin, say activists, is not an
            inconsequential body part. In February 1996, Dr. John
            Taylor of the <a href="http://www.umanitoba.ca/"
            target="_blank">University of Manitoba</a> described,
            in the <i>British Journal of Urology</i>, <a
            href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">the intricate array of
            nerves that line the foreskin</a>, concluding that the
            foreskin plays an integral part in men's sexual
            pleasure and function.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, says Denniston, the circumcised penis
            can make intercourse uncomfortable by pulling moisture
            off the vagina. "In America, <a
            href="/library/sex_function/bensley1/">women have a lot
            of dyspareunia</a>, which is painful intercourse. They
            really don't understand why, and doctors don't
            understand why."</p>

            <p>In addition, without the foreskin, he claims, "the
            tension in the skin... can increase the risk of getting
            cracks, allowing STDs of all kinds to go in." Such
            controversial statements fly in the face of the widely
            accepted theory that circumcision actually protects
            against STDs, and that a circumcised penis is more
            hygienic because it is easier to clean.</p>

            <p>"Right now, because we're in a society that has
            traditionally circumcised, we don't recognize the
            benefit of the intact genitals," says Loewen. "Those
            who circumcise cannot justify cutting off healthy
            erogenous tissue. Circumcision does not prevent AIDS.
            Look at the North American population that has
            succumbed to AIDS, the majority of which were
            circumcised. That doesn't support those doctors who are
            promoting this."</p>

            <p>Even if circumcision does protect against infection
            and make hygiene easier, it doesn't justify the
            practice, says Loewen. "There are numerous places on
            the body that are difficult to clean, but we don't cut
            them off. Toenails or ears may be more difficult to
            clean and less pleasurable to clean, but we don't chop
            them off. It's a myth.</p>

            <p>"The idea that we would operate and amputate healthy
            tissue from a baby, from an unconsenting minor, to
            supposedly prevent some hypothetical disease, that goes
            against the Hippocratic oath. It goes against the
            notion of individual rights... Cutting off a healthy
            part of the body to prevent disease is ridiculous. I
            mean, you could prevent diseases of the feet by
            amputating them, but we recognize the benefit of
            feet."</p>

            <p>James Loewen, who himself was circumcised as a
            child, is so adamant about the issue that he
            believes-as does Doctors Opposing Circumcision-that the
            practice of male infant circumcision should be
            outlawed. He has written letters to "everyone," as he
            puts it: health ministers, the prime minister, MLAs and
            MPs.</p>

            <p>So far, he says, the best response he's received was
            from Svend Robinson, who forwarded Loewen's comments to
            other officials, encouraging them to look at the issue.
            Given Robinson's current hiatus following recent
            charges of theft, Loewen may have to find another
            sympathetic ear.</p>

            <p>The trouble with garnering sympathy for his cause is
            that it's seen by many as an affront to religious
            freedoms. With anti-Semitism apparently on the
            rise-following the recent spate of anti-Semitic
            vandalism in Ontario and Quebec-any discussion of a
            circumcision ban cannot help but stir up feelings of
            persecution. As one prominent member of the Vancouver
            Jewish community, who declined to be interviewed for
            this piece, explained, "I don't want to take part in an
            article that could be seen as anti-Jewish."</p>

            <p>For Jews, circumcision is arguably the most
            important ritual of the religion. In Genesis, Chapter
            17, the scripture states that God commands: "Every man
            child among you shall be circumcised. And ye shall
            circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be
            a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. And he that
            is eight days old shall be circumcised among you ...
            And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his
            foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off
            from his people; he has broken my covenant."</p>

            <p>With such a heavy-handed commandment, it's easy to
            understand why even the most reform and liberal of Jews
            have difficulty with the concept of abandoning
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>"God asked that Abraham circumcise himself and his
            sons through the generations as a sign of the
            covenant," says Rabbi Dina-Hasida Mercy, an independent
            rabbi with the Jewish Chaplaincy Society who provides
            rabbinical support from a Reform perspective.</p>

            <p>"That's all that is asked for of Abraham, whereas
            God has made a number of heavy-duty promises to him.
            And it is still considered the sign of the
            covenant."</p>

            <p>She adds: "As a mother, I hate it. But as a rabbi
            and as a Jew, I do it and I recommend to people that
            they do it also."</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, there is a slow but growing movement
            questioning circumcision within Reform Jewish
            communities, particularly in the U.S., but also in
            Canada.</p>

            <p>Brought up in a Conservative Jewish community and
            married to a circumcised gentile, Brenda Birch made the
            difficult choice not to circumcise her now 10-year-old
            son, Isaac, despite her ongoing involvement in the
            Jewish community.</p>

            <p>"As a young woman, I was around a couple of women
            who witnessed their sons being circumcised, and I saw
            the difficulty that they went through in the process.
            The agony, really," recalls the 45-year-old
            organizational development consultant, who lives in
            Vancouver. "I was quite disturbed by it myself, and
            that started me thinking about it, even before [I
            became pregnant] ... The first thing that a male Jewish
            child experiences eight days after they're born is a
            huge sort of assault on their body."</p>

            <p>When Isaac was born, Birch contemplated the true
            meaning of being Jewish, and the issue of freedom of
            choice for the child.</p>

            <p>"A huge decision is being made for a young person
            that doesn't include them in the process. Women don't
            have any kind of physical process that happens to make
            them Jewish or not Jewish," she says. "My connection to
            being Jewish has changed throughout my life, but it's
            always been a connection to the theology. A connection
            to the philosophy, the community, the humanistic
            voice... If you have circumcision being the thing that
            defines you as being Jewish, then you've missed what
            being Jewish is really about."</p>

            <p>Birch's views are, naturally, not exactly
            representative of those in the wider Jewish community.
            She admits that while most of the people she has
            discussed her decision with have respected it, "none of
            them has agreed with it."</p>

            <p>But as more Jews begin questioning circumcision,
            Canada will likely see an increasing number of young
            boys like Isaac. The Reform Jewish community may well
            acknowledge a change to the conventional circumcision
            ritual. The Brit Shalom ceremony, which is gaining
            ground in the U.S. and, in particular, San Francisco,
            is one such option. Dr. Mark Reiss, Jewish
            vice-president of DOC, explains that for little girls,
            the traditional ceremony for infants is a naming
            ceremony, bringing the baby into the "covenant of
            Israel." The ceremony for little boys is the
            circumcision, and then the naming ceremony. "What we've
            done is eliminate the circumcision, and have a naming
            ceremony similar to the naming ceremony for little
            girls. An Orthodox rabbi certainly is not going to
            accept this as a covenant ceremony," he admits. "But
            many Reform rabbis do."</p>

            <p>Reiss maintains a <a
            href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Jewish-shalom.html"
            target="_blank">list</a> of what he calls "celebrants
            of Brit Shalom" who will conduct such a ceremony.
            Currently, there are over 30, including one Canadian,
            in Ontario. For Vancouverites seeking to take part in
            such a ceremony, there is a celebrant just across the
            U.S. border, in Bellingham, Wa.</p>

            <p>For James Loewen, the issue surpasses all religious
            or cultural traditions. "Circumcision is curious
            surgery, because it's surgery that's looking for
            reasons to exist," he says. "When you consider that
            your body is being cut to someone else's
            specifications, somebody who supposedly knows better
            than nature, and that person can affect your physical
            self, and your sexuality and your psyche to this
            degree, that has profound ramifications to spirituality
            and psycho-sexual development."</p>

            <p>But Loewen is optimistic that that's starting to
            change. "The majority of children are being raised
            genitally intact. When the few that are still being
            circumcised come of age, they are going to be bloody
            mad about it."</p>
