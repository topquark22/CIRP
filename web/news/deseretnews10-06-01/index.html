      <h1>Is circumcision outdated ritual?</h1>

      <p>The vast majority of Utah parents would never think of
      intentionally hurting a child, yet they don't think twice
      when it comes to circumcising their newborn baby boys.</p>

      <p>That painful procedure has become an ingrained "social
      ritual" rather than a necessary medical procedure, agreed
      panelists discussing the ethics of circumcision at <a
      href="http://www.uvsc.edu/">Utah Valley State College</a> on
      Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Steve Scott, director of "No Circ of Utah" and outreach
      coordinator of the <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/">national
      organization of Circumcision Information Resource
      Centers</a>, said the first historical record of circumcision
      was recorded in hieroglyphic form in 2,300 B.C. and that the
      practice had been performed at least 1,000 years before
      that.</p>

      <p>The Bible describes circumcision as a covenant between
      Abraham and God, he said, noting the continued prevalence of
      the practice among devout Jewish families. Almost 90 percent
      of Utah parents circumcise their newborn boys, he said, a
      rate substantially higher than the national rate of about 58
      percent. Yet the vast majority are under no religious mandate
      to do so. Most Christian faiths, including The Church of
      Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, have no formal position on
      the procedure. In fact, the <a
      href="/library/cultural/LDS/">Book of Mormon</a> specifically
      states that the law of circumcision "is done away" in
      Christ.</p>

      <p>The practice is not medically necessary or even
      recommended, Scott said, citing four different statements by
      the American Academy of Pediatrics in recent years that
      emphasize the increased risk of cancer in uncircumcised men
      is inconsequential and that circumcision should not be
      recommended as a routine procedure for newborns.</p>

      <p>The reason its prevalence persists, according to Dr.
      Richard Later, has much more to do with tradition and concern
      over "not wanting to look different in the locker room" than
      it does with medical necessity. Later, a 20-year pediatrician
      with Utah Valley Pediatrics, said while he does perform
      circumcisions, he always counsels parents against the
      procedure.</p>

      <p>"The potential medical benefits do not really warrant any
      type of routine recommendation," he said. Yet tradition is a
      powerful force to contend with.</p>

      <p>"It is kind of a ritual thing. When I suggest to parents
      that it's not necessary, my competence is immediately called
      into question. When we do get them to forgo it (initially),
      almost all of them come back and want it done" after talking
      with other family members, Later said. "It's such an
      ingrained thing."</p>

      <p>Peer pressure drove a 15-year-old Latino boy to Later's
      office two weeks ago seeking a circumcision, he said. After
      explaining that he was concerned about possible health
      problems, Later explained they weren't really an issue. The
      boy then confided that, "I just don't want to be different.
      It's hard enough being Latino."</p>

      <p>"It's a tough thing for a doctor, because we're told to do
      no harm." Yet as legal guardians of a newborn, parents are
      the ones who make the ultimate choice, he said. "It's
      difficult to convince people. The rates are declining, but
      not as much as they should be." Jeannine Parvati Baker, an
      author and former midwife, said as a Jewish mother she came
      under intense pressure from family members to have her infant
      boys circumcised. She refused.</p>

      <p>"I grew up in a family where this is a celebration, a way
      to show our love for God," she said. As she attended
      psychology classes at a university when she was a teen, she
      began to understand the "immense trauma" that babies undergo
      during circumcision and decided to further study the
      issue.</p>

      <p>Because there is no medical rationale to make it a routine
      procedure, she said, "what you have is a big person hurting a
      little person for no good reason" based on an ancient
      religious ritual. Yet even doctors who profit financially
      from performing the procedure are beginning to ask parents
      why they are seeking it for their babies, she said.</p>

      <p>The questions need to be considered by parents in an
      informed way before the child is even born, she said.</p>

      <p>"It's been a real long time coming to even have this
      discussion. I think 6,000 years has been long enough to wait
      so welcome to this moment."</p>
