             CUTTING THE PROCEDURE<br />

            <h2>In Last Four Decades, Circumcision Has Lost
            Popularity in United States</h2>
            By GARRY WHITE The Ledger 

            <p>Amanda Mann doesn't claim to be a perfect mother.
            Like any other parent, she has her momentary lapses,
            including the occasional loss of her temper, which are
            understandable for the mother of four boys.<br />
            <br />
             Mann doesn't castigate herself for such episodes. But
            one moment from her first days as a parent does cause
            her continuing remorse.<br />
            <br />
             "The circumcision of my first son is the only thing I
            regret as a parent," said Mann, a Bartow
            resident.<br />
            <br />
             Mann represents a growing segment of the American
            populace, parents who have turned against the
            previously routine practice of having their sons
            circumcised in their first days of life. Circumcision
            rates in the United States have declined from a high of
            nearly 90 percent in the early 1960s to about 57
            percent in 2004, according to the National Health and
            Social Life Survey. The recently issued report found
            rates below 50 percent in some states.<br />
            <br />
             Health experts say immigration from Latin American and
            Asian countries, where circumcision is not a cultural
            custom, has contributed to the decline. But the
            statistics suggest a rise in the number of white,
            native-born parents, like Mann and her husband, Curtis
            Romey, who have decided to go against the norm.<br />
            <br />
             Circumcision - the surgical removal of the foreskin
            from the penis - has ancient origins. In the book of
            Genesis, it is described as a symbol of the covenant
            between God and the Hebrews, and a passage in Leviticus
            mandates circumcision on the eighth day of a boy's
            life. Observant modern Jews regard the procedure as a
            religious obligation, and circumcision is also common
            in Islam.<br />
            <br />
             Some historians say circumcision gained wide
            acceptance because it was believed that removal of the
            sensitive foreskin would make boys less likely to
            masturbate or pursue sex. The practice, long shunned by
            Christians, became prevalent among Western countries in
            the early 20th century and was routine in American
            hospitals by the 1950s. It remains the default choice
            for many Americans.<br />
            <br />
             Though official rates are not available for Polk
            County, Dr. Jeffrey Puretz, a Lakeland
            obstetrician/gynecologist, said he has noticed no
            decline in circumcisions during his 19 years in
            practice.<br />
            <br />
             "Every parent is counseled during pregnancy and given
            information on circumcision," Puretz said. "They
            ultimately make the decision, but I haven't noticed
            that most are not having their sons circumcised."<br />
            <br />
             Mann, 32, hadn't given much thought to circumcision
            before the birth of her first son, Zain, 11 years ago.
            She recalled giving written permission for the surgery
            as she signed a stack of papers in a local
            hospital.<br />
            <br />
             <span class="yellow">"When I changed his diaper the
            first time and saw the wound he'd been given, it made
            me horribly regretful and I couldn't believe I'd
            allowed something so mutilating to happen to one of my
            children, which I'd been given to protect," Mann said.
            "At that point, it became clear to me with any future
            son there was not a chance it would
            happen."</span><br />
            <br />
             <span class="yellow">Mann, a childbirth educator at
            Labor of Love, a natural birthing center in Lakeland,
            said Zain seemed to be in pain for more than a week
            after the circumcision and had difficulty nursing and
            sleeping as a result. Zain also developed <a
            href="/library/complications/gracely1/">adhesions</a> -
            bits of leftover foreskin stuck to the glans - that
            Mann said caused the newborn boy additional
            pain.</span><br />
            <br />
             Mann said she went to almost comical extremes after
            the birth of Asher, her second son.<br />
            <br />
             "I was worried about him being accidentally
            circumcised, so I was maybe a little overvigilant," she
            said. "Anyone who walked in the room, I was making sure
            (they knew) he's not going to be circumcised, even if
            they were delivering a newspaper."<br />
            <br />
             Nancy Moses, a friend of Mann's, arrived at the same
            outlook while pregnant with her first child, who turned
            out to be a girl. Four years later, Moses gave birth to
            a son, John, who is now 2 and, as Moses proudly states,
            not circumcised.<br />
            <br />
             <span class="yellow">"I think I always knew that I
            found circumcision odd, creepy and cruel, even," said
            Moses, 31. "But it wasn't until I was pregnant that I
            knew how horrible it would be if someone hurt my baby.
            And imagine if I was the one to allow
            that."</span><br />
            <br />
             Though some gentiles cite biblical passages as a
            reason for circumcision, Mann and Moses - both
            professed Christians - said their spiritual covenant
            obviates the need for the physical symbol of the Jewish
            covenant.<br />
            <br />
             Moses, 31, a stay-at-home mom, said her husband, Rob,
            was at first inclined toward circumcision, "but as soon
            as he learned about how it happens and how pointless it
            is, he was protective of our son's foreskin."<br />
            <br />
             Leading medical organizations, such as the American
            Academy of Pediatrics, are neutral on circumcision. The
            AAP on its Web site mentions possible health benefits
            of the surgery, including a decreased risk of urinary
            tract infections and sexually transmitted diseases and
            the prevention of foreskin infections, but says the
            "data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal
            circumcision."<br />
            <br />
             When patients ask Puretz for his advice on
            circumcision, he lists the pros and cons without making
            a recommendation either way on what he called an
            "elective" procedure. Puretz, who is Jewish, regularly
            performs circumcisions for Jewish parents as part of
            the brit milah ceremony.<br />
            <br />
             Dr. William Ray, a Lakeland pediatrician, said he
            tells parents the practice is based on cultural rather
            than clear-cut medical factors.<br />
            <br />
             "Most people have made their minds up without the aid
            of a physician," said Ray, a hospitalist in pediatrics
            for Watson Clinic.<br />
            <br />
             <span class="yellow">Ray said the most influential
            factor, aside from cultural and family traditions, is
            insurance coverage. In 2003, Florida joined more than a
            dozen other states in dropping circumcision from the
            list of procedures covered under Medicaid, the program
            for low-income families. Ray said he noticed fewer
            requests for the surgery after the change in coverage,
            though some parents choose circumcision even if they
            have to pay for it themselves.</span><br />
            <br />
             Tabatha Richardson of Winter Haven is one of those
            parents. She chose circumcision for her 10-month-old
            son, Tyler, even though her health plan didn't cover
            the procedure.<br />
            <br />
             Richardson, who made the same decision for an older
            son, said she carefully researched the issue and
            concluded that circumcision made sense.<br />
            <br />
             "There were just so many pros for not just the
            immediate but the lifelong (health) that I decided to
            do it with my second son as well," Richardson said.
            "Even as infants it's easier to keep that general area
            clean and free from infections with them being
            circumcised."<br />
            <br />
             Parents such as Mann and Moses quail at the notion of
            having elective surgery performed on a newborn boy.
            Mann equates circumcision with breast augmentation, and
            Moses calls it "optional cosmetic surgery."<br />
            <br />
             There are three prevalent methods of circumcision. Two
            involve placing a clamp over the penis so the foreskin
            can be excised with a scalpel, and the third uses a
            thread that causes the foreskin to wither and fall off
            in a few days. The newborn usually receives a local
            anesthetic, either in a topical cream or an
            injection.<br />
            <br />
             <span class="yellow">Opponents of circumcision say the
            procedure is doubly harmful, inflicting pain at the
            time of surgery and reducing sexual pleasure later
            through the removal of the nerve-rich foreskin</span>.
            Puretz, the obstetrician, said it isn't clear the
            procedure has negative physical or emotional
            effects.<br />
            <br />
             "When I first trained, there were a lot of physicians
            who weren't using any anesthetic at all, and I felt a
            little disconcerted about that," Puretz said. "Local
            anesthetics ... have virtually eliminated pain from the
            procedure. A lot of babies don't even know it's going
            on while it's happening.<br />
            <br />
             "I don't know one way or the other how babies feel
            about it later in life, subconsciously or consciously,
            if they remember it," he added. "For me personally,
            it's not something I remember."<br />
            <br />
             Mann and Moses would rather err on the side of
            caution. The two mothers also question the validity of
            studies finding lower rates of HIV among circumcised
            men, and they say foreskin hygiene is no more of a
            challenge than keeping ears or noses clean.<br />
            <br />
             Mann, whose sons clustered affectionately around her
            at the family's Bartow home on a recent morning, said
            she's unconcerned that Asher, Atticus or Ivan might
            feel self-conscious or face ridicule for having a
            different penis from other boys.<br />
            <br />
             "The locker-room argument never really held a lot
            water with me," Mann said. "I kind of liken it to,
            well, if I had a daughter who wasn't chesty would I
            consider breast augmentation for her? And the answer to
            that is absolutely, unequivocally not."<br />
            <br />
             Mann and Moses use such words as "amputation" and
            "mutilation" in describing circumcision, they don't
            align themselves with militant "intactivists" who would
            like to see the procedure banned. Both said they
            respect the decisions of any parents who consider the
            matter carefully.<br />
            <br />
             Mann said she hopes more and more parents will arrive
            at the same choice she did.<br />
            <br />
             "I'm proud to have three more intact boys in the
            world," she said.<br />
