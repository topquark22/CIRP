      <h2>ACCORD NOT TO CIRCUMCISE SON STILL LEAVES HEATED LEGAL
      DEBATE</h2>

      <p>A divorcing couple who went to court over the circumcision
      of their 3-year-old son settled the dispute yesterday when
      the boy's mother withdrew a request to have the surgery
      performed.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The case, which
      attracted significant attention from medical groups, legal
      scholars and the media, was decided behind closed doors in
      the Somerville County Courthouse.</p>

      <p>State Superior Court Judge Paul Armstrong signed the
      consent order yesterday morning, which said the request for
      surgery had been dropped and the issue resolved. No other
      terms of the settlement were disclosed. "We are certain that
      our decision will promote Matthew's best interests and
      welfare," read a joint statement released by the boy's
      parents, James Price of Raritan and Jennifer Price of
      Clinton, who share custody.</p>

      <p>James Price has previously maintained that if a
      judge&mdash;at any level&mdash; granted the circumcision, he
      would oppose it. "We are going to do what's right for
      Matthew. We love him very much," the father said yesterday.
      The case, which went on for seven months, became a focal
      point in the debate over the need for circumcision. A
      California-based nonprofit group called the <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/">National Organization of
      Circumcision Information Resource Centers</a>, came to the
      aid of James Price, setting up a <a
      href="http://www.savematthew.com/"
      target="_blank">website</a> to raise funds for his legal
      battle, and filed <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/legal/brief.html"
      target="_blank">court papers</a> to support his opposition.
      About 64 percent of the nation's boys are circumcised shortly
      after birth, according to the National Center for Health
      Statistics, but in 1999, the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">American Academy of
      Pediatrics</a> stepped back from its position that the
      procedure should be done at birth.</p>

      <p>The medical community also weighed in. A "friend of the
      court brief" was filed by the <a href="http://www.msnj.org/"
      target="_blank">Medical Society of New Jersey</a> and the
      Urological Society of New Jersey opposing court-ordered
      treatments. The medical community says those decisions should
      be made by doctors and parents.</p>

      <p>Legal scholars said the case had the potential to set an
      explosive precedent that could have sent divorced or
      separated parents back to court to settle routine health
      matters normally decided by the custodial parent. As the case
      made headlines, James Price appeared on the Howard Stern
      radio show and on the Montel Williams TV talk show.</p>

      <p>While yesterday's settlement might have resolved the issue
      of a circumcision in Matthew's immediate future, it has not
      resolved the debate over the case's legal impact.</p>

      <p>Edward O'Donnell, the attorney appointed to act as
      quardian in the case, said the decision "reaffirms the
      familial autonomy accorded health care decisions, even in the
      context of divorce litigation."</p>

      <p>Another family law professor says the case could have a
      different precedential value. "Even custodial parents'
      viewpoints of medical treatments can only be sustained if
      they can prove that treatment is medically necessary," said
      <a
      href="http://law.shu.edu/faculty/clinical_faculty/stromacl/stromain.htm"
       target="_blank">Claudette St. Romaine</a> at Seton Hall
      University <a href="http://law.shu.edu/" target="_blank">Law
      School</a> in Newark.</p>

      <p>But <a href="http://info.rutgers.edu/RUSLN/cantor.html"
      target="_blank">Norman Cantor</a>, a professor at <a
      href="http://nwk-web.rutgers.edu/law/"
      target="_blank">Rutgers University Law School</a> in Newark,
      said it's hard to tell what long-term effects the case may
      have. "If a private settlement is reached in a case and there
      is not a real authoritative ruling then there is
      no...impact," said Cantor.</p>

      <p>Jennifer Price, 32, filed for divorce last spring. When
      the boy suffered through two cases of foreskin inflammation,
      doctors suggested a circumcision to help alleviate the
      possibility of recurring infections.</p>

      <p>But James Price objected, citing personal trauma from
      penile surgeries he had as a child and the possiblity that
      Matthew might have diminished sexual pleasure in the
      future.</p>

      <p>As is often the case with divorcing couples, the Prices
      turned to the courts to intervene. In August, Armstrong
      ordered the procedure. However, the doctor involved backed
      out after James Price, 40, threatened legal action against
      him. The parties returned to court and Armstrong stuck to his
      initial decision.</p>

      <p>An appellate court agreed.</p>

      <p>Then, in October, the state <a
      href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/index.htm"
      target="_blank">Supreme Court</a> sent the matter back to
      Somerville for a full hearing to determine if the procedure
      was "medically necessary." Yesterday's order brought the case
      to an end.</p>
