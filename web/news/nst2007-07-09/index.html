            <h2>RM20,100 for boy's death</h2>

            <p>09 July, 2007</p>

            <p>KLANG: It was meant to be a surgery for an urinary
            tract infection but it proved fatal for three-year-old
            Nui Jia Yuan. <span class="yellow">After a circumcision
            in 2003, the boy failed to regain consciousness and
            died.</span><br />
            <br />
             The Sessions Court yesterday awarded more than
            RM20,100 to the boy&rsquo;s family but the parents were
            not contented.<br />
            <br />
             "This money will not bring my son back.<br />
            <br />
             "I want the police to continue investigations into
            this case," said the mother Lim Mei Leng, 33.<br />
            <br />
             Lim and her husband, Nui Lian Seng, 37, filed a civil
            suit against Kuben Clinic and Surgery the same year and
            the defendant, Dr M. Kubendran, admitted liability on
            April 23 this year.<br />
            <br />
             Judge Albaishan Abdul Manan awarded the family
            RM10,000 for bereavement, RM8,800 for funeral expenses
            and RM1,300 for laboratory report fees.<br />
            <br />
             The defendant was also ordered to cover the legal
            costs incurred by the family from the time of the
            incident.<br />
            <br />
             Dr Kubendran and his lawyer, however, were not present
            in court.<br />
            <br />
             Albaishan rejected the family&rsquo;s claim for
            general damages citing the fact that the boy was young
            and not employed at the time of death.<br />
            <br />
             According to the statement of claim, Jia Yuan had a
            urinary tract infection and upon doctor&rsquo;s advice,
            the boy was taken to the clinic to undergo
            circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             He was taken to the defendant&rsquo;s clinic on March
            28, 2003, and the surgery took place at 1pm.<br />
            <br />
             A post-mortem report showed that Jia Yuan, who was
            healthy at the time of surgery, failed to regain
            consciousness after the circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             Lim then contacted the doctor and asked if there was
            anything wrong with her son but she was told that he
            would wake up in the next four hours.<br />
            <br />
             Three hours later, Jia Yuan died and Lim lodged a
            police report three days later.<br />
            <br />
             "I want further action to be taken against them. They
            have robbed us of our little boy," Lim told reporters
            outside the courtroom.<br />
            <br />
             Lim, a quality control supervisor, and her husband, a
            welder, have three other children. They were
            represented by counsel <a
