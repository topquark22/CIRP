            <h2>To cut, or not to cut.</h2>

            <p>By CAROL SMITH<br />
            SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER REPORTER</p>

            <p>That was the question anti-circumcision activists
            posed to passers-by and convention-goers outside the
            Pediatric Academic Societies' convention <a
            href="http://www.pas-meeting.org/"
            target="_blank">meeting</a> yesterday in Seattle.</p>

            <p>The protesters, buoyed by the <a
            href="http://mensnewsdaily.com/archive/newswire/nw03/mnd/newswire042903.htm"
            target="_blank">settlement</a> last month of a
            landmark New York case by a man who sued the physician
            who circumcised him as an infant, buttonholed anyone
            who would listen to get them to reconsider their
            positions on circumcision.</p>

            <p>"Most parents do it out of misinformation and
            ignorance," said John Mark, founder of Seattle-based <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>, as
            he handed out leaflets that asked: "Does being born a
            healthy male require surgical correction?"</p>

            <p>Many doctors attending the convention walked on by,
            apparently uninterested in a street-corner debate.</p>

            <p>"There are more important social issues," said one
            doctor, shaking his head. "This is a waste of
            paper."</p>

            <p>Some pedestrians heckled the protesters. And a few
            seemed befuddled.</p>

            <p>"It's done for health reasons, right?" said one
            man.</p>

            <p>Although, originally touted as necessary for
            "hygiene" and to prevent certain cancers, the procedure
            has become a rite of birth in the United States.</p>

            <p>In recent years, however, the American Academy of
            Pediatrics, has backed away from routine
            circumcisions.</p>

            <p>"Circumcision is not essential to a child's
            wellbeing at birth, even though it does have some
            potential medical benefits," the AAP said in a <a
            href="http://www.aap.org/policy/re9850.html"
            target="_blank">policy statement</a> posted on its Web
            site.</p>

            <p>The AAP did acknowledge that cultural, religious and
            ethnic traditions also play a role in making
            circumcision decisions.</p>

            <p>"I've never pushed it," said Dr. Sheldon Korones, a
            neonatologist from Memphis who was attending the
            meeting. "But if the parents want it, I don't oppose it
            either."</p>

            <p>At Seattle's <a href="http://www.swedish.org/"
            target="_blank">Swedish Medical Center</a>, about 60
            percent of newborn boys are circumcised at their
            parents' request, said spokesman Ed Boyle. John
            Geisheker, a Seattle attorney who specializes in
            botched circumcision cases, is hoping for a new wave of
            cases based on the success of the New York case. In
            December, 2000, then 18-year-old William Stowell filed
            suit against the hospital where he was circumcised and
            the doctor who did it. <a
            href="http://firms.findlaw.com//llewellynlaw/practices.htm"
            target="_blank">His attorneys</a> sued for fraud and
            battery, arguing that he didn't consent to the
            procedure, which was done for "non-therapeutic
            reasons."</p>

            <p>Terms of the settlement two weeks ago were not
            disclosed, but <a href="http://www.arclaw.org/"
            target="_blank">other attorneys</a> viewed it as
            validation that such claims would be considered
            seriously.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">In Washington men have a
            three-year window beginning at age 18 during which they
            can sue</span> for what Geisheker calls a "prophylactic
            amputation." No such suits have been filed yet.</p>

            <p>The graphic posters of infants being circumcised and
            other protest literature did make an impression on some
            men.</p>

            <p>"What they need to do is wait until you're 13 and
            let them make the choice themselves," said Charles
            McAteer, 44, who was walking by and said he hadn't
            given the issue much consideration before.</p>

            <p>But Adam Kriston, 35, wasn't so sure circumcision
            was all bad. "I've been told by women the appearance is
            better without it," he said.</p>
