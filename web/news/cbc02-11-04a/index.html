            <i>PENTICTON, B.C.</i> - The report on the death of an
            infant following a routine circumcision has triggered
            renewed calls to ban the procedure in B.C.<br />

            <p><a href="/news/theprovince08-29-02/">Ryleigh Roman
            McWillis was a month old when he bled to death
            following the operation in Penticton in August,
            2002.</a></p>

            <p>A coroner's report released this week makes no
            recommendations for change, which dismays his
            parents.</p>

            <p>Brent McWillis had hoped the coroner's report into
            the death of his son Ryleigh would help prevent a
            similar tragedy in future.</p>

            <p>"It was a very unfortunate and nightmarish thing
            that happened to us," he says. "The only thing I want
            to see is that it doesn't happen to anyone else's
            child."</p>

            <p>Ryleigh's parents say they'd like all hospitals to
            adopt better standards to care for infants following a
            circumcision.</p>

            <table align="right" hspace="20" summary="">
              <tr>
                <td><img src="cbc02-11-04a-2.jpg" width="250"
                height="187" hspace="20" alt="parents" /></td>
              </tr>

                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Meanwhile, other groups opposed to circumcision, are
            calling for an internal review by the <a
            href="http://www.cpsbc.bc.ca/" target="_blank">B.C.
            College of Physicians and Surgeons</a>.</p>

            <p>"This surgery is not necessary, and if the surgery
            is not therapeutic, the risk cannot be undertaken,"
            says John Geisheker, the lawyer for the group, <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Doctors Against Circumcision</a>.</p>

            <p>Dr. Eugene Outerbridge of the <a
            href="http://www.cps.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian
            Pediatric Society</a> says a study last year, showed
            male circumcision exposes children to risk, with no
            real medical benefit.</p>

            <p>But Outerbridge says an outright ban would violate
            the rights of religious minorities.</p>
