            <h3>Newborns, moms infected after stay at St.
            Catherine's</h3>

            <p>By Roni Rabin<br />
             STAFF WRITER</p>

            <p>October 9, 2003</p>

            <p>Two newborns developed antibiotic-resistant staph
            infections just days after being born at <a
            href="http://stcatherines.chsli.org/"
            target="_blank">St. Catherine of Siena Medical
            Center</a> in Smithtown in August, and their mothers
            also were infected, state Health Department officials
            have confirmed.</p>

            <p>Another baby born at St. Catherine also was
            diagnosed with Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus
            aureus, or MRSA, just weeks after his birth May 23, his
            mother, Kelley Gould of St. James, said. St. Catherine
            officials said through a spokesman that there was no
            evidence Gould's infection originated in the
            hospital.</p>

            <p>MRSA doesn't respond to widely used
            penicillin-related antibiotics. It usually develops in
            critically ill patients or nursing home residents who
            have had multiple courses of antibiotics, and is rare
            in newborns. It can cause serious life-threatening
            infections, especially if it spreads to vulnerable
            patients and gets into surgical wounds.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, state <a
            href="http://www.health.state.ny.us/"
            target="_blank">Health Department</a> inspectors spent
            a second consecutive day reviewing infection control
            procedures at St. Catherine's baby nursery, state
            Health Department spokesman Rob Kenny said.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, questions remained about why the hospital
            waited 10 days to report the first infections to the
            state, whether it closed the affected nursery in order
            to disinfect it, whether its internal investigation
            ever determined the source of the infections, and what
            steps were taken after the third and fourth infections
            were identified. Yesterday, Kenny retracted an earlier
            statement saying the hospital had identified one of the
            four infected patients as the source of the infections.
            He said instead that the hospital's investigation of
            the source was inconclusive. But he said the hospital
            acted appropriately to contain the infections, even
            though the cases were not reported to the state until
            Aug. 21, 10 days after the first two cases were
            identified Aug. 11.</p>

            <p>"Aggressive steps were taken to contain it and there
            have been no additional cases since then," Kenny said.
            Suffolk County officials have refused to comment. A
            written statement released by Dr. Gus Mantia, medical
            director of St. Catherine, said the hospital had
            provided documentation to the state showing that "the
            hospital moved promptly to close the infected nursery
            to newborns for approximately 40 hours (Aug. 11 through
            Aug. 13) during which time we disinfected the facility
            before reopening."</p>

            <p>But state officials said they were not informed the
            nursery had been temporarily closed. "They never told
            us they closed the nursery," Kenny said. "They told us
            they isolated the patients who were exposed to make
            sure there was no additional spread to other
            patients."</p>

            <p>Michele Werner, also of St. James, whose baby,
            Brody, was infected four days after his birth on Aug. 7
            and who herself tested positive for MRSA, insisted the
            nursery her son slept in was not closed down. "I only
            left on the 12th and I was there on the 13th. ... Both
            Nurseries A and B were packed with babies," she said.
            "They told me they cleaned them overnight."</p>

            <p>When Werner returned home, she was shocked to learn
            that her friend's baby, born two months earlier at St.
            Catherine, had also picked up a resistant staph
            infection. The friend, Kelley Gould, said she found out
            her baby, Kevin, born May 23, was infected when she
            took him to the pediatrician two weeks after coming
            home from the hospital for what she thought was a
            diaper rash.</p>

            <p>Gould and Werner believe the infection wasn't
            noticed earlier because Gould and her baby were in the
            hospital for only two days. Werner, who had a Caesarean
            section, had been kept in the hospital for five
            days.</p>

            <p>But Werner had an even bigger surprise recently when
            she was shopping at Smith Haven Mall in Lake Grove and
            struck up a conversation with a third mother, whose
            baby was about the same age as her son. She soon
            discovered that the baby, born Aug. 14 in St.
            Catherine, also developed an antibiotic-resistant staph
            infection in the hospital.</p>

            <p>"That's when I started worrying that they were
            trying to keep everything quiet and weren't taking care
            of it," said Werner, who reported her son's infection
            to the state. "You try to do everything you can to have
            a healthy baby, and then this happens. ... I would hate
            for this to happen to another baby."</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">All of the infected babies were
            boys who were circumcised at the hospital</span>,
            though their infections were not in the wounds but on
            the skin on different parts of their bodies, their
            mothers said. They were all treated with Clindamycin, a
            powerful antibiotic, and as a result may face an
            increased risk of incurring additional
            antibiotic-resistant infections, the mothers said.</p>

            <p>Medical experts said the infections underscore the
            larger global problem of proliferation of antibiotic
            resistance, which has been fueled by inappropriate use
            of antibiotic agents. Resistant staph bacteria also can
            cause serious infections such as pneumonia and
            life-threatening blood infections.</p>

            target="_blank">Catholic Health Services of Long
            Island</a> purchased the hospital, then called St.
            John's Episcopal Hospital, in 2000, when it was on the
            verge of bankruptcy. In 1998, it was put under state
            monitoring after state inspections criticized care,
            including infection control practices.</p>
