      <h2>Infant Circumcision: The debate over parents'
      rights,<br />
      human rights and the right to choose</h2>
      By GUSSIE FAUNTLEROY/For The New Mexican July 30, 2001 

      <p><b>For almost two decades, Santa Fe and its nurses and
      doctors have been at the forefront of the growing
      international controversy over routine infant- male
      circumcision. As early as the mid-1980s, some nurses at <a
      href="http://www.stvin.org/">St. Vincent Hospital</a> began
      educating themselves and each other on the issue, refusing to
      assist with newborn circumcisions and offering parents
      information on the potential risks.</b></p>

      <p>At a time when most American health-care practitioners and
      parents accepted the procedure without question, these nurses
      contacted <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/AwardsSpeech.html">Marilyn
      Milos</a>, a registered nurse in California who founded the
      <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/">National Organization for
      Circumcision Information Resource Centers</a> in 1986. Among
      the organizations's central tenets is the belief that newborn
      male circumcision not only provides no medical benefits, but
      is a violation of the child's human rights.</p>

      <p>It is a belief that today is gaining attention in the
      international human rights arena, thanks in part to
      physicians such as Santa Fe's Dr. Christopher Fletcher, who
      see newborn-male circumcision as an unnecessary surgery done
      to a non-consenting patient who could experience harmful
      effects from it for the rest of his life.</p>

      <p>Fletcher and others say they believe the practice
      continues in the United States primarily for the financial
      benefit of the medical industry.</p>

      <p>In response to this kind of criticism, circumcision
      advocates are beginning to fight back with pro-circumcision
      organizations and Web sites. These include physicians
      interested in maintaining the status quo, Jewish proponents
      who say they believe ritual infant circumcision is a mandate
      of God and Jews who see anti-circumcision as a form of
      anti-Semitism.</p>

      <p>Some physicians, including a couple of vocal Santa Fe
      doctors, frame the debate in terms of parents' rights, saying
      parents should have the right to decide if their sons will be
      circumcised, without "undue interference" or "harassment" by
      nurses who oppose the procedure. The question of nurses'
      participation in circumcision came to a head at <a
      href="http://www.stvin.org/">St. Vincent Hospital</a> in
      1992, when a group of 24 nurses - about half the
      maternity-ward nurses, including all the ward's Jewish nurses
      - decided that on human-rights grounds they no longer could
      participate in newborn circumcisions.</p>

      <p>It was the first time in the United States that a group of
      nurses had refused to assist with the surgery.</p>

      <p>The nurses, who said they believed parents were not being
      properly informed about circumcision, also asked the hospital
      administration to provide a consent form that would explain
      the dangers of the surgery, including the possibility of
      "bleeding, infection, mutilation and even death."</p>

      <p>Three years later, <a href="http://www.stvin.org/">St.
      Vincent</a> and the local chapter of the <a
      href="http://www.nuhhce.org/index.html">National Union of
      Hospital and Health Care Employees</a> reached a mediated
      agreement, called a memo of understanding. The agreement did
      not result in a separate consent form for circumcision, which
      hospital officials argued would be too complicated to
      implement. The hospital instead continues to use a generic
      consent form for all types of surgery.</p>

      <p>What the agreement did, however, was provide nurses with
      the legal, contractual right, as conscientious objectors, to
      refuse to participate in newborn circumcisions. At the same
      time, the memo stated the hospital will attempt to secure a
      nurse to assist with the surgery, for parents who decide to
      have it done.</p>

      <p>In 1995, led by Mary Conant, Betty Katz Sperlich, Patricia
      Worth and Mary Rose Booker, the objecting St. Vincent nurses
      formed an organization called <a
      href="http://childrightsnurses.org/">Nurses for the Rights of the
      Child</a>. Affiliated with NOCIRC, it is a separate support
      and educational organization for nurses and health-care
      providers.</p>

      <p>Since that time, the percentage of St. Vincent nurses
      declaring themselves <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/third/nrc.html">conscientious
      objectors</a> has remained steady despite normal staff
      turnover, and recently it climbed somewhat to about 55
      percent of the maternity and women's-services nursing staff,
      according to records kept by Nurses for the Rights of the
      Child.</p>

      <p>Also since the mid-'90s, the number of physicians doing
      routine newborn circumcisions at <a
      href="http://www.stvin.org/">St. Vincent Hospital</a> has
      declined dramatically, according to hospital records. And the
      hospital's rate of newborn circumcision - currently about 4
      percent - has dropped to among the lowest in the United
      States.</p>

      <p>At the same time, many newborn circumcisions take place in
      doctors' offices, where records are harder to track. When
      these are included, the total circumcision rate in Santa Fe
      is estimated to be between 10 and 20 percent of all newborn
      males.</p>

      <p>Northern New Mexico's relatively low rate can be
      attributed in part to education by St. Vincent's nurses and
      also to the fact that newborn circumcision is not part of
      traditional Hispanic or Native American cultures, local
      nurses and physicians say.</p>

      <p>Fletcher was trained to do circumcisions, and in his early
      practice as a family physician in Santa Fe, he did them.</p>

      <p>In 1981, however, his employers at La Clinica de la Gente
      decided the clinic would discontinue routine newborn
      circumcisions, and they told Fletcher he no longer could do
      them.</p>

      <p>Fletcher says initially he was indignant, as a physician,
      at being told what to do. However, when he began reading
      material given to him by La Clinica staff, he realized how
      little he actually knew about the issue.</p>

      <p>He became convinced it was not a medical but a
      human-rights issue, and he stopped performing the surgery in
      1981. For a while, he referred parents to other doctors who
      would circumcise, but as he learned more, he stopped even
      making referrals and gradually became a vocal opponent.</p>

      <p>Since 1983, Fletcher has had a private family practice in
      Santa Fe and has continued to gather and disseminate
      information on circumcision. In 1998, he spearheaded a
      national survey that queried physicians around the United
      States on their personal beliefs, feelings and practices
      regarding circumcision, which continues to be the single most
      common surgical procedure in American medicine today.</p>

      <p>Describing it as the first major survey of its kind,
      Fletcher presented the results at England's <a
      href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford University</a> in August
      1998, at the fifth annual international symposium on sexual
      mutilation. The gathering was titled "Male and Female
      Circumcision: Medical, Legal and Ethical Considerations in
      Pediatric Practice," and papers presented at it were
      published in a <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/fifth/index.html">book</a>
      of the same title.</p>

      <p>Among the most significant findings in Fletcher's survey:
      More than half (53 percent) of American doctors who perform
      circumcisions on newborn males say they believe the procedure
      is more harmful than beneficial. Of these doctors, 37 percent
      also say they personally oppose the operation but continue to
      perform it.</p>

      <p>Combined with other responses, Fletcher says he sees these
      physicians' apparent ambivalence as confirming his belief
      that many doctors continue doing - and in some cases
      soliciting - the surgery largely because it is something they
      think parents expect. If the father was circumcised, he and
      the child's mother often believe their son will want to "look
      like daddy," physicians say.</p>

      <p>Circumcision opponents, on the other hand, say they
      believe it actually might be the parents who want their child
      to look like daddy and who are uncomfortable with the idea of
      an uncircumcised son looking different. Parents rarely are
      given the information or skills to cope with these feelings,
      Worth said.</p>

      <p>Fletcher says he believes the survey also indicates many
      American physicians themselves are under-informed on
      available current medical research and do not provide
      adequate information on the risks. The research, he says,
      points to no proven medical benefits of circumcision.</p>

      <p>Worldwide, the United States is one of the few countries
      where routine newborn circumcision is widespread, with
      roughly half of all American baby boys (about a million
      babies) undergoing the procedure each year. And of the
      countries where circumcision is practiced, American doctors
      are virtually alone in justifying it on a medical, rather
      than religious, basis.</p>

      <p>Over the past 150 years, various American medical journals
      have claimed the surgery as a cure for such diverse
      complaints as masturbation, idiocy, moral laxity, excessive
      sexual passions, criminal behavior, facial tics, indigestion,
      swollen feet, tuberculosis, diabetes, deafness, heart disease
      and kidney failure. Claims made by American physicians today
      focus primarily on prevention of penile cancer, urinary-tract
      infection and HIV/AIDS.</p>

      <p>Israel maintains a high rate of circumcision on the
      grounds that it is required by God for all Jewish males, and
      in some parts of the world, Sunni Muslims also circumcise for
      religious reasons.</p>

      <p>Including all cultures and religions, about 15 percent of
      the world's males are circumcised.</p>

      <p>Those who oppose circumcision as a human-rights issue say
      they are fighting for the right of the newborn male not to
      have a healthy part of his body surgically removed without
      his consent.</p>

      <p>On the other side of the debate locally, Dr. Richard
      Lieberman is among Santa Fe's self-described "advocates for
      free choice." Lieberman is an emergency specialist at St.
      Vincent who worked a number of years ago as a family
      physician doing obstetrics and family planning for the Indian
      Health Service.</p>

      <p>In that position, he performed numerous circumcisions on
      male Indian babies.</p>

      <p>While newborn circumcision is not part of his current job,
      Lieberman strongly defends what he believes is the right of
      parents to choose the procedure for their sons without undue
      interference by nurses or others who oppose it. He sees it as
      an inviolable religious right for Jews and Muslims.</p>

      <p>At the same time, Lieberman acknowledges the procedure
      done on 2-day- old babies in hospitals does not conform to
      the letter of Jewish law, which calls for a mohel, or ritual
      religious circumciser to perform the rite on 8-day- old male
      babies in the family's home while saying the appropriate
      prayers.</p>

      <p>Currently, only a handful of Santa Fe physicians perform
      newborn circumcisions at St. Vincent, with urologist Dr.
      Steve Lucero doing almost all of them, according to hospital
      records. Because of "animosity (by nurses) in the newborn
      nursery," Lucero also performs the surgery in his office, he
      said, adding that "sometimes parents are mislead and told it
      can't be done at St. Vincent, but there's no policy at the
      hospital that says it can't be done." Lucero said he began
      doing more circumcisions a number of years ago, after a
      number of mothers came to him complaining that nurses were
      calling circumcision child abuse and saying there was no
      medical reason for it.</p>

      <p>Lieberman also is offended by language used by some nurses
      and other circumcision opponents - words such as mutilation,
      child abuse and "forced amputation of a healthy part of the
      genitals" - which he feels amounts to harassment of parents.
      Fletcher defends the use of such terms as technically and
      ethically accurate, especially in light of potential risks
      and complications, which he believes often are played down or
      covered up by doctors.</p>

      <p>Fewer than half of all physicians provide adequate
      anesthesia or pain relief for newborn circumcisions, Fletcher
      said. A 1997 survey of pediatric residents around the United
      States (reported in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent
      Medicine) states that only about 10 percent of residents and
      faculty members at teaching hospitals used anesthesia for
      circumcisions.</p>

      <p>A pain-relief cream, EMLA, is used by some doctors, but is
      not FDA approved for use on infants under 3 months old and is
      not effective, Fletcher said, adding that it is physically
      impossible to apply an adequate quantity of the cream to a
      tiny newborn's penis.</p>

      <p>Lieberman, on the other hand, quotes from studies and
      claims made by vocal pro-circumcision advocate Dr. Thomas
      Wiswell, who recommends use of the cream.</p>

      <p>One of the most common problems associated with
      circumcision is curvature of the penis, which is present in
      about 70 percent of circumcised men and virtually
      non-existent among intact men, according to large-scale
      studies by Drs. Robert Van Howe and Christopher Cold.</p>

      <p>In addition, between 5 and 15 percent of circumcisions in
      the United States are "botched" to the extent that they
      require reconstructive surgery, Fletcher said. Significant
      hemorrhaging occurs in 15 percent of American and British
      circumcisions, with 2 percent of these serious enough to be
      fatal or lead to transfusions. Infection - including systemic
      and septic infection - is not uncommon, according to a report
      by Fletcher to the Perinatal Committee at St. Vincent
      Hospital.</p>

      <p>Among the most serious risks of the surgery is <a
      href="/library/complications#amputation">amputation of the
      penis</a>, which has been reported twice in New Mexico in the
      past few years, the Perinatal Committee report states. (In
      both cases, the baby boy was "converted" to a girl.) And
      death, most often as a result of hemorrhage or septic
      infection, is reported at a rate of about 230 per year in the
      United States. However, circumcision opponents believe the
      death rate is actually higher. In many cases, opponents say,
      deaths are attributed to other causes, or a false cause of
      death is listed.</p>

      <p>On the flip side of the issue, in the little-discussed
      arena of the sexual benefits of remaining intact, separate <a
      href="/library/anatomy/ohara/">recent surveys</a> indicate
      sexual pleasure is greater for both intact men and their
      partners. A main factor is the existence of special sensitive
      nerve tissue on the end of the foreskin. This sensitivity can
      be understood by gently stroking your lips and then your
      chin, Worth said. The level of sensitivity in the foreskin is
      similar to that of the lips, while sensitivity of the rest of
      the penis is comparable to that of the chin.</p>

      <p>In addition, there is reduced vaginal friction as the
      penis glides in the foreskin, and the foreskin prevents
      drying and desensitization of the penis head.</p>

      <p>Other studies also point out that the penis of an intact
      man is longer (by an average of a half-inch) and bigger
      around than one that is circumcised.</p>

      <p>The issue of sexual function is one of the most important
      pieces of information parents should be given, said Katz
      Sperlich, St. Vincent nurse, adding that when they receive
      this information, many parents decide not to have their sons
      circumcised.</p>

      <p>Lucero and Lieberman base their support of circumcision,
      at least in part, on what they view as medical evidence of
      potential health benefits, although Lucero said he tells
      parents the "risks of surgery pretty much balance out" with
      the risk of urinary-tract infection or penile cancer faced by
      uncircumcised males. At the same time, both Lieberman and
      Lucero cite the risk of urinary-tract infection and penile
      cancer as primary medical reasons for neonatal
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>"Penile cancer is astronomically greater in uncircumcised
      boys and men, according to everyone's review of the
      literature. To deny this is to do people a disservice,"
      Lieberman said.</p>

      <p>Fletcher counters that penile cancer is very rare,
      occurring at a rate of fewer than 1 out of every 100,000 men
      worldwide. With more than 90 percent of Scandinavian men
      intact, the rate of penile cancer in that part of the world
      has dropped steadily in recent years and is lower than in the
      United States, Fletcher said.</p>

      <p>Lieberman said he also believes there is growing medical
      evidence, especially in Africa, that circumcision "appears to
      be protective" against viruses that may be precursors to
      HIV/AIDS. But Fletcher sees things differently, saying, "The
      AIDS connection has been disproven. Ethiopia, with the one of
      highest rates of circumcision in Africa, also has the highest
      rate of AIDS."</p>

      <p>How do national medical associations weigh in on the
      issue? The <a href="/library/statements/ama2000/">American
      Medical Association</a>, the <a
      href="http://www.aafp.org/policy/camp/4.html">American
      Academy of Family Physicians</a>, the American Cancer Society
      and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology have
      all issued statements recommending against routine newborn
      male circumcision, as have the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">Canadian Pediatric
      Society</a> and the <a
      href="/library/statements/aaps/">Australian Association of
      Pediatric Surgeons</a>.</p>

      <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics came out against
      circumcision in the <a
      href="/library/statements/aap/#1971">1970s</a>, and it later
      reversed that position.</p>

      <p>The Academy's most-recent <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">statement</a>, issued in
      1999, concludes that "Existing scientific evidence
      demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn
      circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to
      recommend routine neonatal circumcision." So why does the
      procedure continue to be so widespread in this country?</p>

      <p>According to Lieberman, Lucero and other local physicians
      who perform circumcision or support the right of parents to
      have it done, the main factors are cultural and parental
      expectations, religious mandates and beliefs and the
      potential for medical benefits.</p>

      <p>According to opponents, one of the driving forces is
      money.</p>

      <p>Circumcision opponents estimate the cost to insurers and
      parents in the United States at about $2 billion a year,
      including a host of related "hidden" hospital and doctor
      charges resulting from the procedure and complications. For
      physicians with busy metropolitan practices, 150 to 200
      circumcisions a year can bring in as much as $60,000 through
      this one procedure alone.</p>

      <p>Yet Fletcher notes that despite anonymity, more than half
      the doctors in his survey would not say how much they charge
      for the surgery. (Many said they couldn't remember.) Of those
      who responded, the average charge was $121 and ranged as high
      as $300.</p>

      <p>The cost is covered by most insurance programs and by
      Medicaid in most states, with the highest Medicaid program
      paying almost $300. In New Mexico, Medicaid reimbursement
      pays almost $160.</p>
