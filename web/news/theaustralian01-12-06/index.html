            <h2>Men kill circumcision nurse</h2>

            <p>From correspondents in Johannesburg</p>

            <p>A GROUP of young South African men taking part in
            coming of age rituals due to include circumcision
            turned on their male nurse and killed him, an official
            said today.</p>

            <p>Sizwe Kupelo of the Eastern Cape provincial health
            department said the men aged 18 to 25 beat the man to
            death with sticks at the site of their initiation
            ceremonies in Port Elizabeth on Friday.</p>

            <p>"He was attacked by about 20 initiates who assaulted
            him, and he later died," Mr Kupelo said.</p>

            <p>He said the attack followed complaints by the men
            that they were not being properly looked after during
            their initiation ceremonies, but did not elaborate.</p>

            <p>The nurse had been in charge of caring for the men
            ahead of their circumcision.</p>

            <p>No arrests had been made yet, Mr Kupelo said.</p>

            <p>A number of South African tribes including the
            Ndebele, Sotho and Xhosa send teenaged boys and young
            men into the bush for up to eight weeks to learn their
            tribe's cultural and moral values and undergo coming of
            age ceremonies including circumcision.</p>

            <p>In recent years the practice of circumcision has
            come under scrutiny as dozens of boys have been
            accidentally killed or mutilated by amateur elders who
            have seized on the tradition as a way to make
            money.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Mr Kupelo said in the Eastern
            Cape at least 10 young men had died during the current
            initiation period, which began in December.</span></p>

            <p>Chairman of the Eastern Cape House of Traditional
            Leaders, Chief Ngangomhlaba Matanzima, condemned the
            attack, which he said showed there were "serious
            problems" around initiations.</p>
