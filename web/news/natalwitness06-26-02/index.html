            <p><b>Police probe charges after</b></p>
            <hr size="1" />

            <p>Five Xhosa boys who were at an initiation school in
            a mountainous, heavily wooded area near Heidelberg
            [Gauteng Province] have been found dead, while two are
            in intensive care at a local hospital and at least 16
            others need treatment for severe trauma and septic
            wounds after their traditional circumcisions.</p>

            <p>All the children are from Orange Farm.</p>

            <p>Four men, all allegedly helpers of a chief whose
            every order they have to obey, are being held by police
            and questioned on charges of murder, attempted murder,
            assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm and
            culpable homicide.</p>

            <p>The body of the first of the children - all of whom
            are between 13 and 14 years old - was found on Sunday
            night outside the homestead beside the initiation
            school. Members of the emergency services found the
            bodies of the other four early on Tuesday after reports
            were received of badly injured children outside the
            homestead.</p>

            <p>The other 18 initiates were away from the
            inaccessible site when police arrived, but later in the
            morning they came from the mountains to which they had
            fled. Some of them were badly injured, two so seriously
            that they could not walk. They all had particularly bad
            injuries to their feet.</p>

            <p>All 18 children were badly traumatised and had to be
            treated for shock. Some showed signs of assault,
            apparently by knobkerries.</p>

            <p>Two of the dead had serious infections in their
            circumcision wounds. The other deceased had not been
            circumcised, but, said police spokesman Superintendent
            Roy Fry, all had serious injuries, mostly to their
            upper bodies and feet.</p>

            <p>Paramedics said the biting cold of the previous
            night probably also played a role in the children's
            deaths. According to them, the temperature in the
            mountains where the school is situated fell as low as
            10 degrees below zero.</p>

            <p>There are reports of two other initiation schools
            being conducted at present in the same mountains, one
            of them for girls. Police and paramedics said on
            Tuesday that they will close these schools and forbid
            them to continue with their activities.</p>

            <p>Traditionally, the weaker initiates in a school are
            rejected by the others and banished outside the kraal,
            where they are left to fend for themselves. Someone in
            the school usually sends a message to emergency
            services for help, but paramedics said the call often
            comes too late.</p>

            <p>The remaining intitates initially did not want to
            leave the school on Tuesday.</p>

            <p>They have already completed three of the five weeks
            and will now have to attend the next school to complete
            the initiation process.</p>

            <p>According to experts, most young Xhosa men wish to
            undergo circumcision so that they will be viewed as
            adults, but the ritual's traditional medical and moral
            aspects must not be underestimated.</p>
