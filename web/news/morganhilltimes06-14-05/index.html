            <h2>Circumcision rates are down amid controversy</h2>
            Tuesday, June 14, 2005 

            <p>Gilroy obstetrician <a
            href="http://www.american-physician.com/profile/CA/Morgan-Hill/15221"
             target="_blank">Dr. Jumnah Thanapathy</a> recalls
            seeing a <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/gluckman/"
             target="_blank">botch</a>, one of the tiny percentage
            of procedures that go wrong, when she was still working
            at Kaiser Medical Center years ago.</p>

            <p>During the elective circumcision of an infant, the
            doctor performing the procedure accidentally cut too
            far down, slicing off the glans and much of the head of
            the infant&rsquo;s penis.</p>

            <p>It was sewn back on like a re-attached finger, said
            Thanapathy, but the damage was done. Its extent would
            be impossible to calculate until the wound healed.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;We live in a society that looks at the
            statistics of a situation,&rdquo; said Thanapathy.
            &ldquo;People see a 99 percent success rate, and they
            never think that they&rsquo;ll be part of that one
            percent, but I just don&rsquo;t see taking that risk
            for an elective procedure.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Thanapathy is one voice in a growing number of
            physicians and parents questioning the practice of
            circumcision, a surgical procedure to remove the
            penis&rsquo; foreskin.</p>

            <p>Nationwide, the circumcision debate has raged in
            chat rooms and through medical journals for more than a
            decade, but the procedure, practiced since ancient
            times in many Middle Eastern cultures and commonly in
            the United States since the end of World War II, has
            fallen precipitously in popularity among inhabitants of
            the Western United States - down from 62 to 37 percent
            between 1980 and 1999, according to the <a
            href="http://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank">Centers for
            Disease Control</a>.</p>

            <p>Conversely, the number of infants receiving
            circumcisions in Midwestern and Southern states has
            risen, despite an increasing number of insurance
            companies and state programs unwilling to cover the
            procedure anymore.</p>

            <p>In the Midwest, <a href="/library/statistics/USA/"
            target="_blank">circumcision rates</a> are as high as
            81 percent, according to the CDC. At the heart of this
            disparity are deep and conflicting emotional ties both
            to religion and social precedent.</p>

            <p>Most circumcisions in the United States after WWII
            were recommended for hygienic reasons.</p>

            <p>Soldiers from allied forces had experienced
            b[a]lanitis, an infection between the foreskin and
            penile shaft caused by a buildup of urine or foreign
            material, in &ldquo;epidemic proportions&rdquo; during
            actions in sandy North Africa, according to an article
            by Dr. J. M. Hudson published in the June 2004 issue of
            the <i>Journal of Medical Ethics</i>.</p>

            <p>It would be easier to circumcise infant males, who
            are less likely to experience serious side effects from
            the procedure, than treat blanitis later in life
            military physicians concluded, and this logic worked
            its way into medical practice back home as doctors who
            had been serving in the war transitioned back into
            civilian practice, he wrote.</p>

            <p>Along the way, other medical reasons for the
            procedure were attached. It could reduce the risk of
            frequent urinary tract infections in boys, provide
            minor protection against the transmission of sexually
            transmitted diseases and prevent congestion of the
            penis, studies found. Thus, circumcision became a
            common practice in the United States.</p>

            <p>But the evidence never quite stacked up in the minds
            of many physicians and critics. In 1999, the American
            Academy of Pediatrics issued a <a
            href="/library/statements/aap1999/"
            target="_blank">statement</a> from its second task
            force on circumcision stating that, while the procedure
            did offer some benefits in terms of hygiene, there was
            insufficient evidence to suggest the procedure be
            performed routinely. The group warned that it could
            have dangerous side effects - botched procedures could
            lead to excessive bleeding, infection and damage to the
            penis, including decreased ability to experience sexual
            sensation later in life.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;(The foreskin) provides a different kind of
            stimulation for both partners, it keeps secretions in
            place, and it protects the head of the penis from
            exposure when rubbing up against clothes,&rdquo; said
            circumcision opponent Ronald Goldman, Ph.D., author of
            &ldquo;<a
            href="http://www.jewishcircumcision.org/book.htm"
            target="_blank">Questioning Circumcision: A Jewish
            Perspective</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a
            href="http://www.circumcision.org/cht.htm"
            target="_blank">Circumcision: The Hidden
            Trauma</a>.&rdquo; &ldquo;(Circumcision) removes a
            significant portion of the sensitive, erogenous tissue
            of the penis that compromises up to half of the shaft
            skin.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>However, the issue is sensitive not only in terms of
            circumcision&rsquo;s relationship to sexual function,
            but to cultural beliefs. Jewish baby boys are routinely
            circumcised on their eighth day of life as part of a
            celebratory ceremony called the <i>Brit Millah</i>, or
            more commonly known as a bris. A special rabbi, trained
            and medically qualified to perform circumcision, snips
            the foreskin of the infant without anesthesia as part
            of the ceremony meant to celebrate the boy&rsquo;s
            acceptance into the Jewish community, which
            traditionally traces descent through maternal
            lines.</p>

            <p>The tradition arises from a story in the Torah in
            which God made a covenant with Abraham naming him the
            father of nations in exchange for his vow to be
            circumcised along with all the men of his house and all
            of his descendants. Many Christian sects also have
            adopted the rite of circumcision as part of their
            religious experience as well. The majority of both
            these groups reject the idea of circumcision as an
            unnecessary or dangerous procedure.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I understand that circumcision is a hot topic
            right now, but extremist groups advocating against
            circumcision and seeking to change religious traditions
            to match their personal feelings often fail to
            recognize this important procedure in Jewish tradition
            has been performed successfully for over 3,500
            years,&rdquo; said <a
            href="http://www.emeth.net/yjm.html"
            target="_blank">Rabbi Yitzhak Miller</a>, leader of <a
            href="http://www.emeth.net/"
            target="_blank">Congregation Emeth Reform
            Synagogue</a>, which serves the South Valley area.</p>

            <p>The origin of these beliefs may have its roots in a
            more practical purpose, however. In
            &ldquo;Circumcision: A Surgeon&rsquo;s
            Perspective,&rdquo; Hutson postulated that the ritual
            cuttings arose as a common practice of early Jews,
            Christians and Muslims as a means to combat the problem
            of b[a]lanitis among adult males, but noted that the
            practice had never attained popularity in less-sandy
            areas such as Europe or Asia.</p>

            <p>Circumcision for any reason other than medical
            necessity is uncommon in Hispanic culture, rare in
            Europe and nearly unheard of in Australia, a country
            whose medical establishment actually recommends against
            the process.</p>

            <p>In the United States, the majority of infants
            circumcised are white or black, but policy on the
            procedure has changed markedly in the last 20 years,
            according to Thanapathy.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;When I was having my own children, the doctor
            didn&rsquo;t even ask me,&rdquo; said Thanapathy, <span
            class="yellow">who does not perform
            circumcisions</span>. &ldquo;They just gave me the
            consent form to sign. I had to say, &lsquo;Hey! Wait a
            minute.&rsquo; I think now it&rsquo;s gotten to the
            point where most parents who are going to get the
            procedure ask for it instead of the doctor
            offering.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>In her own practice, about 50 percent of parents ask
            about the procedure, but only about 30 percent end up
            following through with circumcision.</p>

            <p>Even among Jewish families, some of
            circumcision&rsquo;s staunchest supporters, a few
            members have split with the norm.</p>

            <p>Gillian Flato, a San Jose-based technical writer,
            formed the group <a
            href="http://www.jewsagainstcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Jews Against Circumcision</a> nearly
            five years ago after a conversation with a friend from
            India shifted her perspective on the subject.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;In Judaism, the ritual is considered routine,
            but Indians don&rsquo;t generally circumcise,&rdquo;
            said Flato. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Any religion that
            says you have to cut off part of your penis in order to
            join is not one I&rsquo;m interested in.&rsquo; I
            thought, &lsquo;Wow! When you say it like that, it
            seems like a really screwed up thing to do.&rsquo;
            We&rsquo;re raised with all kinds of lies and myths
            that it doesn&rsquo;t hurt, and it&rsquo;s quick and
            heals well, but (after researching it) I came to the
            conclusion that it was painful and barbaric and a gross
            violation of human rights.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Flato has found kindred spirits in the 125 or so
            members of her online group, but she has also faced
            some resistance from her family and community, some of
            whom don&rsquo;t believe she can support Judaism with
            the view.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;In the Talmud it says we are not to inflict
            pain on others or harm others,&rdquo; said Flato.
            &ldquo;How can we turn around and torture infants?
            Religion is in your heart, not in your penis. If you
            believe in Judaism and you go to synagogue and you
            believe, I believe you&rsquo;re a Jew.&rdquo;</p>
