      <h2>Foreskin success</h2>
      <b>Despite a flap over penis reconstruction, an Australian
      conference concludes that doctors can rebuild them.</b> 

      <h3>By Jack Boulware</h3>
      May 12, 2000 | <b>A</b>fter much debate, and no doubt the
      viewing of many slides projected against a screen, an
      Australian medical conference concluded last week that the
      male foreskin can be repaired. The flap of skin around the
      penis can be rebuilt, reconstructed and improved
      cosmetically, with few complications.

      <p>The crux of the conference's debate centered around
      international medical reports claiming that up to one-third
      of foreskin reconstructions led to complications. In the
      experience of Australia's penis surgeons, this was not the
      case.</p>

      <p>Over a two-year period at Melbourne's Royal Children's
      Hospital, 23 patients had successful operations, and 22 of
      them ended up with a handy-dandy retractable foreskin, as the
      good Lord intended. If your baby needs a new foreskin,
      apparently you'd do well to fly the tyke to the land down
      under. They seem to know what they're up to, foreskin-wise.
      Foreskin restoration in Australia comes about in a variety of
      ways. Sometimes a baby boy is born with an incomplete
      foreskin, which affects one in 300 births. Occasionally a boy
      is born with the opening to the urethra located on the
      underside of the penis, preventing a normal erection. And
      then there's the parents expressing concern over the cosmetic
      appearance of their little boy's penis. What if you don't
      want the "circumcised look"?</p>

      <p>Melbourne pediatric surgeon Professor Paddy Dewan assured
      the assembled group of penis doctors that there is a
      solution. "In situations where a circumcised appearance is
      considered undesirable, foreskin reconstruction offers an
      appropriate choice to parents," Professor Dewan said.</p>

      <p>Circumcision is still a hot topic of discussion in
      Australia, with the nation's percentage of foreskin removal
      hovering somewhere between 25 and 40 percent, and on the
      decline. [CIRP note: This is inaccurate. Actually, the
      incidence of neonatal circumcision in Australia was 10% in
      1996.] Medical arguments in favor of the operation claim that
      it reduces infection and disease, but pediatric doctor policy
      on the subject goes back and forth.</p>

      <p>Professor Dewan added that parents tend to have very
      strong views about the procedure, both for and against. "It's
      a small piece of skin that creates a lot of emotion," he
      said.</p>
