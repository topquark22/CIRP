            <h2>Uganda: Kasese, Bundibugyo Asked to Suspend
            Circumcision</h2>

            <p><b>Anne Mugisa</b><br />
             Kampala</p>

            <p>THE <a href="http://www.health.go.ug/"
            target="_blank">Ministry of Health</a> has asked the
            people of Bundibugyo and Kasese to suspend their
            circumcision ceremonies due this festive season until
            the Ebola epidemic is contained.<br />
            <br />
             The commissioner for health services, Dr. Sam Okware,
            told journalists yesterday that the ministry is holding
            discussions with the communities to suspend the
            practice, adding that the district authorities should
            make by-laws to suspend circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             Circumcision among the Bamba and Bakonjo was in the
            past conducted every five years but recently, the
            practice has been taking place between the end and the
            beginning of the year.<br />
            <br />
             The health state minister, Dr. Emmanuel Otaala, said
            another suspected case of Ebola had been reported in
            Congo on the Bundibugyo border.<br />
            <br />
             The patient had clinical signs of Ebola and the
            ministry had asked its personnel to cooperate and treat
            the case, he said.<br />
            <br />
             "Since this case is at the border with us, it is a
            threat to us and, therefore, needs to be handled."
            Otaala said Uganda is part of a Great Lakes initiative,
            where districts on the borders cooperate to deal with
            an emergency.<br />
            <br />
             In Bundibugyo, the minister said, health workers had
            managed to break the transmission chain of Ebola
            through surveillance and tracing over 400 contacts of
            victims.<br />
            <br />
             The cases are all in Bundibugyo in the sub-counties of
            Kasitu, Bubukwanga, Busaru, Bundibugyo trading centre
            and Harugale, he said, adding that the disease is "on a
            downward trend."<br />
            <br />
             Otaala said the cumulative number of cases had risen
            to 127 but the death toll remained at 35.<br />
            <br />
             He added that 39 patients, including six health
            workers, had recovered and were discharged. The
            remaining patients, he said, are expected to be
            discharged in a few weeks.<br />
            <br />
             Those discharged were given a package, which included
            a mattress, pair of bed-sheets, a blanket, three sets
            of clothing, a mosquito net, a pair of shoes, sandals,
            two plastic jerrycans, two plastic basins, three boxes
            of condoms, 10 bars of soap, food rations for five
            people for three months, a bottle of Jik disinfectant
            and 10 packs of sanitary towels.</p>
