            <h2>Bill makes circumcision an assault</h2>

            <p><b>Sheena Adams</b></p>

            <p>A Bill outlawing virginity testing &shy;and making
            parents and doctors liable to charges of assault for
            circumcising children is one step closer to
            enactment.</p>

            <p>The Children's Bill was finalised by the <a
            href="http://www.parliament.gov.za/pls/portal/web_app.new_middle_column?p_page_name=parliament_na"
             target="_blank">National Assembly</a>'s social
            development committee this week and includes a number
            of controversial clauses. At least one opposition party
            voted against the Bill's adoption, saying the version
            finalised by the portfolio committee was "watered down"
            compared to previous drafts.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.acdp.org.za/"
            target="_blank">African Christian Democratic Party</a>
            has complained about clauses which allow 12-year-old
            children to undergo abortions and buy condoms.</p>

            <p>ACDP MP Cheryllyn Dudley also said a lack of
            consultation between the departments of Justice and
            Social Development over the Bill had proven to be a
            stumbling block for the committee.</p>

            <p>"This was confirmed during a visit by the Minister
            of Social Development, Zola Skweyiya, and the Deputy
            Minister of Justice, <a
            href="http://www.anc.org.za/people/delange.html"
            target="_blank">Johnny de Lange</a>, to a meeting of
            the portfolio committee. The committee was told that
            amendments made by the committee, apart from those
            submitted by Justice would not be entertained and must
            be scratched.</p>

            <p>"Apparently the deputy minister of justice had very
            belatedly become aware of the work being done on the
            Bill which would affect the justice committee," she
            said.</p>

            <p>The instruction to MPs was apparently in reference
            to some of the definitions in the Bill dealing with
            parental obligations and custody issues which, if
            passed, would repeal regulations passed by the Justice
            Department.</p>

            <p>The department did not respond to calls on
            Wednesday. Maria Mabetoa, chief director responsible
            for children's rights in the <a
            href="http://www.welfare.gov.za/"
            target="_blank">Department of Social Development</a>,
            also refrained from commenting.</p>

            <p>The Bill says no person may refuse to sell condoms
            to children older than 12 and that other contraceptives
            may be provided to children on request and without the
            consent of caregivers or parents.</p>

            <p>This is, however, premised on the fact that "proper
            medical advice" be given to the child beforehand. Under
            the heading Social and Cultural Practices, the Bill
            also outlaws virginity testing, putting it in the same
            league as female circumcision and saying that children
            have the right not to be subjected to cultural and
            social practices which are "detrimental to the
            well-being, health or dignity of the child".</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">It adds that taking into
            consideration the age, maturity and "stage of
            development" of a male child, he has the right to
            refuse circumcision.</span></p>

            <p><span class="yellow">A male child that was subjected
            to circumcision against his will may lay a charge of
            assault, indecent assault or assault with the intent to
            do grievous bodily harm, as the case may be, against
            the person that performed the circumcision or a person
            that is under an obligation to protect that child from
            maltreatment, abuse or degradation and failed to fulfil
            this obligation," it says.</span></p>

            <p>With 11-million children living on less than R200 a
            month, according to child rights groups, they had
            argued for the Bill to include a comprehensive social
            security scheme as well as an overarching national
            policy framework, something that appeared in the first
            version of the Bill drawn up by the <a
            href="http://wwwserver.law.wits.ac.za/salc/salc.html"
            target="_blank">South Africa Law Reform
            Commission</a>.</p>
