      <h2>JUDGE DELAYS HEARING ON TODDLER</h2>

      <h4>More advice sought in circumcision case</h4>

      <p><b>BY KATE COSCARELLI</b></p>

      <p>A hearing in Superior Court in Somerville to determine if
      circumcision is medically warranted for a 3-year-old was
      postponed yesterday because additional doctors must still
      examine the toddler.</p>

      <p>Matthew Price's parents cannot agree if circumcision is
      the best way to treat recurring irritations to his foreskin.
      His mother, Jennifer Price of Clinton, now wants him to
      undergo the surgery as a way to alleviate the irritations.
      James Price of Raritan, his father, is adamantly opposed,
      citing trauma from his own penile surgeries. The parents have
      joint custody.</p>

      <p>The case, a part of the Prices' divorce proceedings, has
      attracted national attention from medical societies, legal
      scholars and media outlets because it could affect how
      doctors treat patients and how parents raise their
      children.</p>

      <p>In August, Superior Court Judge Paul Armstrong ruled the
      boy could be circumcised, and an Appellate Division panel
      upheld that decision.</p>

      <p>However, the Supreme Court suggested full testimony should
      be heard on the matter. That hearing, meant to determine if
      the procedure is "medically necessary," was set to begin in
      Armstrong's courtroom yesterday.</p>

      <p>Before the announcement of postponement, Armstrong ruled
      the case should remain open to the public.</p>

      <p>"I cannot think of anything that could be a more private
      fact than if an individual is circumcised or not," said
      Edward O'Donnell, the court-appointed attorney to represent
      Matthew.</p>

      <p>Ronald Heymann, who represents Jennifer Price, joined his
      argument that the boy could be shamed if he found out later
      about the proceedings.</p>

      <p>Attorneys for The <a
      href="http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/index.ssf"
      target="_blank">Star-Ledger</a> and the <a
      href="http://www.c-n.com/" target="_blank">Courier News</a>
      successfully argued the public had a right to observe the
      proceedings as a way to better understand the final
      decision.</p>

      <p>"The public has the right to scrutinize the judicial
      process," said Donald Robinson, attorney for The
      Star-Ledger.</p>

      <p>Julie Marino, who represents the toddler's father, also
      argued the hearing should remain open because the boy's
      personal information was already widely known.</p>

      <p>The judge said that if the information had not already
      been distributed by attorneys for the Prices, he might have
      considered closing the court "in hopes of thwarting future
      psychological harm and embarrassment."</p>

      <p>However, the public has a right to observe the
      decision-making process, especially given the public and
      controversial nature of the issue, he said.</p>

      <p>O'Donnell said he would appeal the decision. He has 10
      days to file the request with the Appellate Division.</p>
