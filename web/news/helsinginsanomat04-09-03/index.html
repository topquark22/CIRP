            defers move on Kuopio botched circumcision
            case</font></b></p>

            <p>Kuopio case leads to assessment of fundamental
            rights</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.oikeus.fi/vksv/2442.htm"
            target="_blank">office of the Prosecutor General</a> is
            not making a decision on how to proceed with the case
            of <a href="/news/helsinkinews08-21-01/">the botched
            circumcisions of a number of Muslim boys in Kuopio</a>
            in 2001 until a new law is passed on the question.</p>

            <dl>
              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>The office has investigated whether or not the
              operations, conducted at the boys' homes, constitute
              criminal assault. The boys had to be hospitalised for
              complications resulting from the operations.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>Prosecutor General <b>P&auml;ivi Hirvel&auml;</b>
              is deferring a decision on whether charges will be
              made, pending a decision by Parliament on the issue
              of religiously-mandated male circumcision.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health is to
              convene a working group to consider whether or not
              legislation is necessary to regulate the
              practice.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>Hirvel&auml; told <i>Helsingin Sanomat</i> that
              an examination of international treaties suggests
              that the legality of circumcisions "is very
              questionable".<br />
              <br />
              </dt>

              <dd><b>Hirvel&auml; sees the Kuopio case</b></dd>

              <dt>as a precedent for weighing the issues of the
              fundamental rights of freedom of religion and the
              integrity of the body.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>Hirvel&auml; mentions the <a
              href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm"
              target="_blank">Biomedicine Convention of the
              Council of Europe</a> and the <a
              href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-convention/">
              UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>. The
              Biomedicine Convention states that medical procedures
              can be implemented without the patient's consent only
              if the procedure has an immediate medical
              benefit.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>The UN treaty requires that each signatory
              eliminate practices which harm the health of the
              child.<br />
              <br />
              </dt>

              <dd><b>The working group</b></dd>

              <dt>is expected to start its work in early May, and
              is expected to be given six months to complete its
              task, allowing the Government time to prepare
              proposed legislation by the end of the year.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>The <a
              href="http://www.vn.fi/stm/english/index.htm"
              target="_blank">Ministry of Social Affairs and
              Health</a> and the <a
              href="http://www.kuntaliitto.fi/english/indexeng.htm"
              target="_blank">Association of Local and Regional
              Authorities</a> have called on Finnish public health
              facilities to deal with religiously-mandated
              circumcisions. The Ministry estimates that about 100
              ritual circumcisions are performed on boys living in
              Finland each year.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>"We must find some kind of a solution that would
              allow people equal access to treatment. It is
              difficult for me to see that Finland would ban the
              circumcision of Jews and Muslims", says <b>Ritva
              Halila</b>, secretary-general of the national
              consultative <a
              href="http://www.etene.org/e/index.shtml"
              target="_blank">committee on health care
              ethics</a>.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>The committee issued a statement four years ago
              pointing out that male circumcision has not been
              shown to have any health benefits, but that the
              procedure also does not present any serious problems,
              if performed correctly.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>"It is important to make sure that they are
              performed under proper conditions, that the children
              would get good treatment for the pain, and that the
              risk of complications would be minimised", Halila
              says.<br />
              <br />
              </dt>

              <dd><b>The issue of male ritual circumcision</b></dd>

              <dt>came up in 2001 when <a
              href="/news/helsinkinews08-21-01/">six Muslim boys in
              Kuopio had to be hospitalised after their
              circumcisions</a>. An African-born doctor performed
              the operations in a private home.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>The Provincial Government of Eastern Finland
              reprimanded the doctor over the case.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>In Finland the Jewish and Muslim Tatar
              communities have long dealt with their own
              circumcisions. There have been no problems, as the
              operations have been performed under hygienic
              conditions within the relatively well-to-do
              communities themselves.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>However, the influx of Muslim immigrants, <a
              href="/news/helsinkinews08-24-01/">many of whom
              cannot afford the services of private doctors</a>,
              has changed the situation.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>In March, the <a
              href="http://www.vn.fi/stm/english/index.htm"
              target="_blank">Ministry of Social Affairs and
              Health</a> sent a letter to Finland's university
              hospitals urging public health facilities to perform
              the religiously-mandated operations as a way of
              averting back-alley circumcisions.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>
