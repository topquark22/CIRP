      <h1>Sacred practice or unnecessary procedure?</h1>

      <p>Sunday, June 09, 2002</p>

      <p>By BOB IVRY<br />
      Staff Writer</p>

      <p class="text">During her recent pregnancy, Rachel struggled
      for a way to balance the weight of 2,800 years of religious
      tradition with the overwhelming protective emotions she felt
      for her unborn boy.</p>

      <p class="text">Rachel and her husband are Jewish, and every
      male born to their families - as far back as the biblical
      Abraham, presumably -had been circumcised. But Rachel made up
      her mind that she wouldn't have that done to her son.</p>

      <p class="text">"I didn't want my baby cut," says Rachel, a
      North Jersey resident who asked that her real name not be
      used. "There's something deeply corrupted about it. It's a
      traumatic and barbaric thing."</p>

      <p class="text">Her husband's stance kept Rachel awake at
      night. He disagreed. He wanted his son, as she tells it, to
      "look like him."</p>

      <p class="text">"It's a very loaded issue," Rachel says.
      "People are not aware of the feelings they have about
      circumcision."</p>

      <p class="text">While the number of hospital circumcisions in
      the United States has risen slightly over the last two
      decades, a growing number of Jewish families are questioning
      their religion's most sacrosanct ritual - cutting the
      foreskin off an 8-day-old baby's penis.</p>

      <p class="text">"There's been a noticeable increase in
      interest the last three or four years," says Ronald Goldman
      of the <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/"
      target="_blank">Circumcision Resource Center</a> in Boston.
      "Lots of people don't want to make it public, but we get
      hundreds of contacts from Jewish families."</p>

      <p class="text">In most cases, the apostasy is initiated by
      the mother. The force of her emotions is often pitted against
      the combined influence of her husband, the baby's
      grandparents, the religious community, and the formidable
      power of centuries-old, Bible-sanctioned practice.</p>

      <p class="text">"Women are tormented," says Laurie Evans, a
      Jewish anti-circumcision activist who lives in Westchester
      County, N.Y. "They don't want to renounce their religion, but
      they want to protect their children."</p>

      <p class="text">The ritual, called a bris or b'rit milah,
      dates to the beginning of Judaism. It is performed by a
      specially trained rabbi, called a mohel, as part of a
      religious ceremony, often in the parents' home, and is
      followed by a feast. The bris is so central to Jewish life
      that, by Jewish law, it supersedes observance of the Sabbath
      or Yom Kippur, Judaism's holiest days.</p>

      <p class="text">"There is no more sacred rite in Judaism,"
      says Rabbi Stephen Wylen of Temple Beth Tikvah, a Reform
      synagogue in Wayne. "To be Jewish and not to be circumcised
      is to be outside the fold."</p>

      <p class="text">Genesis 17:10-14 mandates that a Jewish boy
      be circumcised on the eighth day after his birth.</p>

      <p class="text">"This is my covenant, which you shall keep,
      between me and you and your descendants after you: Every male
      among you shall be circumcised," God commands Abraham, the
      Jewish patriarch. "Any uncircumcised male who is not
      circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off
      from his people; he has broken my covenant."</p>

      <p class="text">Twenty-eight centuries later, the threat of
      shunning - as well as the fear of disappointing generations
      of ancestors, some of whom died defending their loyalty to
      Judaism -still weighs heavily on Jewish parents.</p>

      <p class="text">Leah, another Jewish mother against
      circumcision who requested anonymity, says that during her
      pregnancy she was a "crazy woman with hormones" who faced the
      opposition of her husband, who "didn't want to go against
      God," and her father-in-law, who told her that if the baby
      wasn't circumcised, "something negative would happen to the
      boy."</p>

      <p class="text">"You don't want to be so arrogant as to
      question God," Leah says. "I want my family to be Jewish, and
      I want my son to identify himself as Jewish. But it was my
      baby's sex organ. I couldn't let anyone hurt him."</p>

      <p class="text">Leah says the birth of a healthy boy and her
      insistence the baby not be cut stopped familial debate on the
      subject - the procedure wasn't done - and eight months later,
      "we don't talk about it." But her husband's stance had
      surprised her.</p>

      <p class="text">"He gave religious reasons for having our son
      circumcised," she says. "And it's funny, because he really
      doesn't go to synagogue. He's not that religious."</p>

      <p class="text">In fact, activists say circumcision is often
      the only Jewish ritual many secular Jewish fathers feel
      compelled to conduct.</p>

      <p class="text">"They don't observe the Sabbath, they eat
      pork, they even marry non-Jewish women, but they insist on a
      circumcision," Evans says. "I don't get it."</p>

      <p class="text">Wylen says that while an uncircumcised boy
      can still be a Jew, "it's shameful if you're Jewish not to
      circumcise."</p>

      <p class="text">"God made the world imperfect," Wylen says.
      "He gave us the responsibility to perfect it." Without a
      circumcised penis, "one doesn't represent the perfection of
      the human body that's required to enter the covenant with
      God."</p>

      <p class="text">Adam, a North Jersey father who spoke on
      condition of anonymity, says his uncircumcised 11-year-old
      son, a Hebrew school student preparing for his bar mitzvah,
      is unaware his body is different from other Jewish boys'.</p>

      <p class="text">"He showers all the time in the gym locker
      room and nobody says anything to him about it," Adam says.
      "It's never been an issue."</p>

      <p class="text">But Rabbi Michael Goldstein of the <a
      href="http://www.grjc.org/" target="_blank">Glen Rock Jewish
      Center</a>, a Conservative congregation, says an
      uncircumcised boy studying for his bar mitzvah is "not a
      desirable thing."</p>

      <p class="text">"I don't know if I'd allow it," Goldstein
      says. "I don't think I'd let it get to that stage. I'd have
      significant, serious conversations with the family long
      before we reached the point where the child was preparing to
      become a bar mitzvah. I'd be trying to convince the parents
      to have the boy circumcised."</p>

      <p class="text">Many of the Jewish couples questioning ritual
      circumcision would agree with the rabbis that the decision to
      have a bris is not an intellectual one. For the observant
      Jew, "it's a practice based in belief," Goldstein says. For
      Rachel and Leah, their maternal impulse to protect their
      newborns was beyond argument.</p>

      <p class="text">"I feel sickened by the idea," Rachel says.
      "Female circumcision makes the front page of The New York
      Times, but [male] circumcision is accepted as common
      practice."</p>

      <p class="text">In 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics,
      citing evidence that the procedure has little or no medical
      benefit, <a href="/library/statements/aap1999/">halted its
      longtime advocacy of routine hospital circumcision</a>. The
      pediatricians' group also suggested for the first time that
      infants receive anesthetic medication before they are
      circumcised -a practice that today is usually skipped in the
      hospital and during the bris.</p>

      <p class="text">In a bris, the child is held by his godfather
      while family and friends look on. The mohel may dip his
      finger in wine and feed the wine to the child - a traditional
      method of helping the baby deal with pain. Prayers are
      recited and the mohel usually explains the significance of
      the event. Then the cutting begins.</p>

      <p class="text">The mohel pulls forward the foreskin with a
      hemostat -a pair of surgical pliers - then slides a specially
      designed clamp called a "<a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/procedure/mogen/">mogen</a>"
      along the head of the penis and onto the foreskin. Using the
      mogen as a guide, the mohel then slices enough of the
      foreskin to expose the head of the penis and the junction
      where it meets the shaft. The boy bleeds, and the wound is
      dabbed with gauze and bandaged. In most cases it takes less
      than two days for the cut to heal.</p>

      <p class="text">"Two things are required in a ritual
      circumcision," says Rabbi Gerald Chirnomas, a Boonton mohel
      who estimates he's performed 13,000 ceremonies. "The first,
      of course, is the removal of the foreskin. And the second,
      which many people don't know, is the shedding of blood, which
      is mandated by the Bible."</p>

      <p class="text">Chirnomas cites Ezekiel 16:6: "Live by your
      blood."</p>

      <p class="text">Hospital circumcision differs in
      instrumentation as well as spiritual significance. A device
      called a <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/procedure/gomco/">Gomco
      clamp</a> is usually used in hospital procedures, which
      critics say simply takes too long.</p>

      <p class="text">Hospital circumcision remains the most
      commonly performed surgery in the United States.
      Circumcision's contemporary secular roots can be traced to
      the <a href="/library/history/moscucci/">Victorian era</a>,
      when it was believed to be a cure for masturbation. And while
      most of the world eschews the practice, 65.3 percent of
      American hospital newborns were circumcised in 1999,
      according to the National Center for Health Statistics. In
      1979, the figure was 64.3 percent.</p>

      <p class="text">Though Rachel decided against a bris without
      the influence of statistics or the recommendations of medical
      organizations, she had no idea if her husband would agree
      with her.</p>

      <p class="text">"I left the decision up to him," Rachel says.
      "It was difficult for me, but he appreciated it."</p>

      <p class="text">Rachel's husband never told her what his
      decision was. It became clear to Rachel only after he phoned
      his mother to announce the boy's birth.</p>

      <p class="text">"I knew the question was coming, right after
      my husband told her it was a boy," Rachel says.</p>

      <p class="text">It was a question that's been asked by Jewish
      grandmothers for 2,800 years: When's the bris?</p>

      <p class="text">There wouldn't be a bris, Rachel's husband
      told his mother. And when his mother asked him why, Rachel's
      husband answered, "It's not for us."</p>

      <p class="text">"I'm delighted," Rachel says. "I always go
      back to the idea that in this generation, a loving father can
      make a decision he wasn't allowed to make for himself."</p>
