            <p><small>Monday June 27 2005 11:39:10 AM

            <p>June 26 : Shahrasti thana police arrested three
            doctors and a health assistant of Chitoshi Bazar
            Grameen Kalyan Shastha Kendra on June 23 last in
            connection with a GR case and another case filed with
            Shahrasti thana by one Jahangir Hossain as his son
            <span class="yellow">Habibur Rahman, died after
            circumcision.</span></p>

            <p>All the three doctors and health assistant were sent
            to jail hajat on Saturday by the court of Magistrate
            (Ist class) Abul Hasnat Humayun Kabir who rejected
            their bail petition.</p>

            <p>The arrested doctors and a health assistant are Dr.
            Abu Taher Md. Golam Mortaja (32) hailing from Kaliganj
            village of Dimla thana in Nilphamari district, Dr.
            Sultana Nazneen (26), of Jhitka village in Harirampur
            upazila of Manikganj district, Dr. Aklima Khatoon (21)
            of Raghoi village in Madhupur thana of Tangail and
            health assistant Akbar Hossain (20) hailing from
            Mirjapur village of Laksam upazila of Comilla.</p>

            <p>According to the police source, Jahangir Hossain
            brought his only son Habibur Rahman (8 years) to
            Chitoshi Bazar Grameen Kalyan Shastha Kendra for
            circumcision from his home at Bernaiya at around 12-30
            PM on June 23 last. After circumcision at this centre,
            ill-fated Habib was profusely bleeding at his male
            organ.</p>

            <p>Then, an injection was pushed by the doctor. At
            this, the boy's condition worsened.</p>

            <p>As per advice of the doctors of this centre, Habib
            was being rushed to Comilla Sonar Bangla Hospital but
            he <span class="yellow">died</span> on the way at
            around 4 PM.</p>

            <p>This angered the people. A case was filed.</p>

            <p>Police then arrested the above three doctors along
            with a staff and sent them to Chandpur district jail in
            June 24.</p>
