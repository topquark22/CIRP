            <h2>Law puts HIV prevention at risk</h2>

            <p><b>Belinda Beresford</b></p>

            <p>South African researchers and doctors are worried
            that a new law intended to protect young men from death
            or mutilation as the result of circumcision may weaken
            the potential use of circumcision to curb the spread of
            HIV.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">This month President Thabo
            Mbeki signed into law the Children&rsquo;s Act, one of
            whose clauses bans circumcision of male children under
            the age of 16 except when &ldquo;performed for
            religious purposes in accordance with the practices of
            the religion concerned&rdquo;, or &ldquo;for medical
            reasons on the recommendation of a medical
            practitioner&rdquo;.</span></p>

            <p>HIV/Aids experts are concerned that the latter
            qualification is too narrowly defined and may not allow
            parents to choose to have their sons circumcised on
            health grounds to reduce chances of HIV infection when
            the child becomes sexually active.</p>

            <p>Some have also questioned why circumcision is not
            regulated as a medical procedure and allowed as long as
            certain minimum sanitary and safety guidelines are
            followed.</p>

            <p>Legal experts have also expressed concern that by
            allowing circumcision on religious grounds, the Act
            unfairly discriminates against people who are not
            religious. One expert pointed out this could mean that
            agnostics would have to get medical permission to
            circumcise their children, whereas Jewish and Muslim
            parents would not.</p>

            <p>CEO of the <a
            href="http://www.sahrc.org.za/sahrc_cms/publish/cat_index_26.shtml"
             target="_blank">Human Rights Commission</a> Tseliso
            Thipanyane said his organisation had lobbied for
            greater regulation of circumcision because of the young
            men who died or were mutilated because of botched or
            unhygienic circumcisions in some traditional initiation
            schools.</p>

            <p>By last week 16 young men were reported to have died
            as the result of circumcisions in &ldquo;initiation
            schools&rdquo; in the Eastern Cape region.</p>

            <p>Michael Masutha, a member of Parliament&rsquo;s
            social development committee, which oversaw the
            legislation, said the Children&rsquo;s Act would not
            take full effect until at least 2008, after the
            implementing regulations were framed by the relevant
            government department.</p>

            <p>Masutha said the regulations would clarify how
            broadly the phrase &ldquo;medical grounds&rdquo; should
            be read. There was no intention to ban circumcision,
            only to regulate it more effectively.</p>

            <p>The provinces currently have different rules on male
            circumcision &mdash; <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/eastcapenews10-25-01/">the
            Eastern Cape, for example, bans the circumcision of
            children under the age of 18</a>.</p>

            <p>However, Jonathan Berger of the <a
            href="http://www.alp.org.za/" target="_blank">Aids Law
            Project</a> said that while &ldquo;medical
            grounds&rdquo; could be interpreted to allow
            circumcision on hygienic grounds, &ldquo;it is not a
            good idea to have such uncertainty in the law and to
            wait for the matter to be resolved in court. Either
            medical reasons should be defined or the clause should
            be amended to allow for general health
            reasons&rdquo;.</p>

            <p>Last year, research at Orange Farm in the Vaal area
            found that circumcision of adult men appeared to reduce
            their risk of contracting HIV by up to 70%. Research in
            Uganda has suggested that HIV-negative women are 30%
            less likely to catch the virus from their HIV-infected
            partners if the latter have been circumcised.</p>

            <p>Trials similar to those in Orange Farm are under way
            in Kenya and Uganda. If they replicate the South
            African findings, it would intensify pressure on
            governments to add circumcision to the list of
            prevention strategies.</p>

            <p>The Botswana government recently mandated
            counselling of all mothers of newborn boys on the
            potential health benefits of circumcision.</p>

            <p>Circumcision is a highly emotive issue, with some
            lobby groups likening it to female genital mutilation.
            The Children&rsquo;s Act bans the latter outright.</p>
