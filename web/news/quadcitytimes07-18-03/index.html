            <h2>Circumcision: What's a parent to do?</h2>

            <p>by Jason Hidalgo, Gannett News Service</p>

            <p>Once a widely accepted procedure among American
            doctors, male circumcision has experienced a steady
            decline in the last few decades.</p>

            <p>Circumcision of newborns peaked in the United States
            some 30 years ago at about 85 percent to 90 percent,
            says Dr. George Denniston, president of <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>, a
            Seattle-based anti-circumcision organization with
            members worldwide. These days, those numbers are around
            55-60 percent, he says. The rates are even lower in the
            western states of California, Oregon and Washington,
            which have a combined rate of 35 percent, Denniston
            adds. Some states also have stopped covering
            circumcisions under Medicaid.</p>

            <p>Denniston attributes the decline to increased
            awareness among parents of what he considers a
            dangerous, needless procedure.</p>

            <p>"It doesn't take anybody with an IQ over 70 to
            realize that taking off half the skin of a normal penis
            causes problems," Denniston says. "There's not a single
            medical association in the entire world that approves
            routine infant circumcision."</p>

            <p>Others, however, point to studies showing the
            benefits of circumcision. These include reduced risk
            for urinary tract infections in babies and penile
            cancer in older men, and potential benefits in
            preventing HIV.</p>

            <p>Then there are the religious and cultural reasons
            behind the procedure.</p>

            <p>"It's a ritual that celebrates the covenant into the
            Jewish (religion)," says Rabbi Myra Soifer of Temple
            Sinai in Reno, Nev. "It's central to the Jewish faith
            because that's how Abraham came into the covenant as
            the first Jew and agreed to the foundation and
            theological commitment that is now Judaism."</p>

            <p>Medical matters</p>

            <p>No one can quite peg the origins of circumcision,
            which dates back even further than Biblical accounts of
            Abraham, according to the online Circumcision
            Information and Resources Page.</p>

            <p>"It's one of those things that have been done for a
            long time and nobody even knows why it started,"
            Denniston says.</p>

            <p>In the 1800s, circumcisions were encouraged by some
            doctors in the United States as a way to prevent boys
            from masturbating. These days, the touted benefits for
            circumcision are more grounded in science than the
            masturbation-induced madness and eternal damnation that
            old proponents used to warn people about.</p>

            <p>A common advantage mentioned is easier hygiene,
            although this is more a convenience factor and not a
            pressing need, says Dr. Catherine Wagoner, a
            pediatrician. Proper hygiene, or the lack thereof,
            might be considered as an indication for circumcision
            in men who are either too old or unable to properly
            clean underneath the foreskin, since this can cause
            infections, Wagoner says.</p>

            <p>Circumcision also is used to treat <a
            href="/library/treatment/phimosis/">phimosis</a>, a
            rare condition in which the foreskin is too tight to be
            pulled back. In some cases, this condition can restrict
            blood flow to the head of the penis.</p>

            <p>Studies show that babies who are circumcised have a
            significantly lower risk for <a
            href="/library/disease/UTI/">urinary tract
            infections</a> during their first year - about a one in
            1,000 chance as opposed to one in 100 for their
            uncircumcised counterparts. Some studies also show
            increased protection against genital warts and <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/STD/">sexually
            transmitted diseases</a> such as gonorrhea and
            syphilis, and a reduced risk of <a
            href="/library/disease/cancer/">penile cancer</a> in
            men and <a href="/library/disease/cancer/">cervical
            cancer</a> in female partners.</p>

            <p>One of the strongest findings for circumcision's
            benefits appeared in the June 10, 2000 issue of the
            British Medical Journal. The study found that
            circumcised men are two to eight times less likely to
            contract HIV through sex. Researchers said the likely
            culprits were cells with HIV receptors found in the
            inner surface of the foreskin. Although stopping short
            of recommending routine male infant circumcision, the
            researchers went on to suggest circumcision as an
            additional means of preventing HIV in countries with a
            high prevalence of infection, especially those in
            central and southern Africa.</p>

            <p>Anti-circumcision advocates, though, are quick to
            dismiss the mentioned benefits.</p>

            <p>"If you look at the research, there's no reason to
            do it or not to do it," Wagoner says.</p>

            <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics mirrors Wagoner's
            view. In its <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/">circumcision
            policy</a> released in 1999, the AAP states that
            circumcision does have some potential health benefits,
            although those benefits aren't significant enough to
            recommend routine circumcision.</p>

            <p>Cultural decisions</p>

            <p>With the medical debate for circumcision raging to a
            standoff, the driving force behind circumcision now
            largely rests on two factors: culture and religion.</p>

            <p>For anti-circumcision advocates, these could be the
            biggest roadblocks of all.</p>

            <p>People like Denniston, for example, cite
            psychological damage to infants due to <a
            href="/library/pain/">pain</a> and to boys who realize
            they "aren't whole" when they first learn about their
            circumcision. In some cases, though, not being
            circumcised also opens a boy to the same psychological
            trauma due to ridicule from circumcised peers. This is
            especially worse for boys in cultures that
            traditionally circumcise their adolescents as a right
            of passage to manhood.</p>
