              <h2>How govt foots the FGM bill</h2>
            </center>

            <p>By NATION Reporter</p>

            <p>Just four months after Kenya made it illegal to
            circumcise girls, one can still take a daughter or
            sister for the operation and earn Sh1,000 from the
            government for it.</p>

            <p>Female Genital Mutilation has moved from traditional
            circumcisers to the clean and sterile minor theatres in
            recognised Kisii hospitals, performed by trained
            nurses. The cost of the operation is almost uniform in
            all the hospitals and clinics, but working parents get
            the fairest deal as their children are admitted to the
            wards with pretentious illnesses, and the <a
            href="http://www.kenyaweb.com/government/ministries/health.html"
             target="_blank">National Hospital Insurance Fund</a>
            foots the bill.</p>

            <p>The operation costs Sh500 and admission per day
            ranges from Sh350 to Sh500. NHIF recognises these
            hospitals and gives a rebate of Sh800 per day. A parent
            who takes his or her daughter for the operation and
            lets her stay in a hospital bed for five days can
            collect a Sh1,000 gift on the child's discharge - the
            cost having been covered by the government.</p>

            <p>During the school holidays, girls flood the
            hospitals and stay in the wards for two to five days,
            depending on the wishes of their parents.</p>

            <p>On the day of discharge, a parent, usually the
            mother will pick up the child, explains an
            administrator at one of the hospitals.</p>

            <p><b>Badly kept secret</b></p>

            <p>Circumcision of girls in the hospitals of Kisii
            District is not a secret. A parent or guardian who
            wants a daughter circumcised will only need to inform
            the nurses in charge - and it is over and done within
            minutes.</p>

            <p>"When the NHIF officials visit the wards, we insist
            that the girls are unwell so that their stay here is
            paid for. We also ask the girls to say the same if
            asked by the officials," says a nurse at another
            hospital.</p>

            <p>The Hospital Insurance Fund's area manager, Mr Mark
            Chepkweny, says NHIF does not sponsor FGM in hospitals.
            "We are aware that circumcision of girls goes on in
            December and during that time, our inspectors, both
            male and female, are more vigilant."</p>

            <p>But if the medical staff do not tell the truth about
            the ailments of their girl patients, it is difficult
            for officials to establish what they are paying
            for.</p>

            <p>This, however, will not continue for long, says
            Chepkweny. NHIF is about to establish a quality control
            department to include paramedics, whose knowledge will
            be useful in studying patients' conditions and deciding
            whether it is necessary for one to be admitted for the
            number of days being claimed.</p>

            <p>For now, once the bill is paid, the new initiate's
            mother buys the child a new dress and shoes, then takes
            her home to muted celebrations. There will be no song
            or dance like it used to be. Before, circumcision
            heralded celebrations in the village and there was
            plenty to eat and drink when a child crossed the
            biggest hurdle into adulthood.</p>

            <p>Knowing it is illegal to have girls circumcised is
            forcing the celebrations underground. "The parents
            probably just want to fulfil a cultural requirement,"
            says a teacher in the area.</p>

            <p>Campaigners against female genital mutilation have
            been arguing that the danger of HIV/Aids infection
            posed by circumcising girls using unsterilised
            equipment made the practice dangerous. Now, with
            qualified health professionals carrying out the
            operation in homes and hospitals, that argument is
            becoming null and void. It also takes the fight back to
            Square One.</p>

            <p>Julie Maranya, one of the activists fighting FGM in
            the area, says it is difficult to eradicate the
            practice as it has been commercialised by medics.</p>

            <p>"Our work has seen traditional circumcisers down
            their tools but circumcision of girls goes on in
            hospitals. It is no longer culture that is influencing
            it but the greed for money by these medical
            practitioners," asserts Julie.</p>

            <p><b>No harm seen</b></p>

            <p>Some medical practitioners do not see anything wrong
            with circumcising girls. Apart from the increased
            revenue for their private hospitals and clinics, the
            practice ensures the health workers' continued
            acceptance from the larger community for upholding
            tradition.</p>

            <p>The nurses who organise with parents to circumcise
            their daughters privately in homes are happy for the
            extra income.</p>

            <p>"It is the culture of the people and if that is what
            they want done to their daughters, we grant it," argues
            a nurse. Although she says she will not have her
            daughters circumcised, she sees nothing really wrong
            with the practice.</p>

            <p>"It's a minor incision and after they are bandaged,
            they quickly heal. In fact, a few hours after the
            operation, you see the girls jumping up and down," she
            confides.</p>

            <p>"They tell us that we will have long painful labour
            but I haven't met a person who said they delivered
            children without labouring. But I know many people
            around here who delivered on their own while doing
            shamba work," explains Mongina Onsase, a family
            planning field worker.</p>

            <p>She will not allow any of her sons to marry a woman
            from the tribe who has not undergone the rite but can
            tolerate a daughter-in-law from the four communities
            that don't practice FGM in the country - Luo, Luhya,
            Turkana and Teso.</p>

            <p>At the Kisii District General Hospital, circumcision
            of girls is carried out under the pretext of admitting
            them for malarial or other treatment.</p>

            <p>All that one needs to do to have his or her daughter
            circumcised is to explain to a nurse or clinical
            officer in confidence about what ought to be done.</p>

            <p>In many cases, FGM is carried out without the
            knowledge of the doctors and hospital administrators.
            The number of patients admitted to the hospital far
            outweighs that of doctors and nurses. Before a doctor
            does his rounds, he will consult with the sister on
            duty who advises him about the patients who need his
            attention. A doctor cannot see each patient - and the
            bulk are under the nurses and clinical officers.</p>

            <p>With such a strain on personnel, it is easy for FGM
            to be carried out under their noses.</p>

            <p>Hema Hospital response: "Circumcision of girls in
            the hospital? Never. Boys we do, but girls never! In
            fact the sister-in- charge, who is my wife, gives
            lectures everywhere condemning circumcision of girls.
            And if you write that we do it here you must come with
            tangible evidence, we will take you to court!" says the
            owner Dr Hezron Manduku.</p>
