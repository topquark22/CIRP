            <p><b>TheTyee.ca</b></p>

            <p>This past April, Vancouver resident Dr. Paul Tinari
            became the first Canadian man to have a
            heath-care-funded foreskin restoration. When he was
            eight years old, doctors at his school performed an
            operation without his consent. After years of painful
            erections, and frequent infections, Dr. Tinari -- with
            the support of his doctor and psychiatrist --
            successfully sued, and as a result, the <a
            href="http://www.gov.bc.ca/bvprd/bc/channel.do?action=ministry&amp;channelID=-8387&amp;navId=NAV_ID_province"
             target="_blank">B.C. Ministry of Health</a> paid for
            90 per cent of the $12,000 operation. Dr. Tinari says
            he hopes that it will set a precedent for legal action
            that will eventually end the practice of infant
            circumcision all together.</p>

            <p>Dr. Tinari, an engineer, considers himself uniquely
            authorized to discuss the subject of circumcision. "I
            was uncircumcised until I was eight, then circumcised
            until I was 48, and am now again uncircumcised, so I
            really have seen all sides of this issue." Tinari, a
            Metis, describes being held down and circumcised as a
            young boy in what he says was "a routine form of
            punishment" for masturbation at residential schools. He
            claims that thousands of young native and Metis boys
            were circumcised during their stays in the residential
            school system.</p>

            <p>Dr. Tinari's case and his efforts to bring awareness
            to the issue are the most recent instalments in a
            movement against what the medical establishment calls
            routine, non-therapeutic male circumcision. North
            America has the highest rates in the world for this
            procedure, but currently, no regional, national or
            international medical body in the western world
            advocates its practice. In fact, many, like the College
            of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C., recommend against
            it. Historically, many doctors performed circumcisions
            believing there were psychological and medical
            benefits, but anti-circumcision advocates say that
            since these medical benefits have now been disproved,
            the issue is one of cruelty.</p>

            <p>Dr. Tinari says his intention is to rectify what he
            sees as "human rights abuse" and a "gross violation" of
            a small child's body.</p>

            <p><b>A brief history of the hoody</b></p>

            <p>The history of circumcision in North America is tied
            to attitudes towards masturbation. In the late 1800s,
            for example, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (who invented
            Kellogg's Corn Flakes and believed that bland foods
            curb passions) was considered the leading circumcision
            authority.</p>

            <p>"A remedy for masturbation which is almost always
            successful in small boys is circumcision," Kellogg
            wrote in his 1888 book, <i>Treatment for Self Abuse and
            its Effects</i>. "The operation should be performed by
            a surgeon without administering an anesthetic as the
            pain attending the operation will have a salutary
            effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected
            with the idea of punishment."</p>

            <p>Many doctors followed his advice, performing
            circumcisions without anesthetic on male and female
            babies.</p>

            <p>At the time, doctors performed female circumcision
            by dripping carbolic acid on the genitalia. Unlike male
            circumcision, this practice did not endure to the
            present day. By the turn of the century, medical
            journals regularly directly listed male circumcision as
            a cure or prevention for many illnesses and even
            criminality.</p>

            <p>In 1928, the American Medical Association published
            a journal article in which renowned British doctor R.W.
            Cockshut wrote: "I suggest all male children be
            circumcised. I am convinced that masturbation is much
            less common in the circumcised."</p>

            <p><b>From dirty to clean</b></p>

            <p>The sexual revolution may have brought a greater
            acceptance of masturbation, but by 1970, <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges-warner/">
            90 per cent of all North American boys</a> were being
            routinely circumcised. Now, many parents who opt to
            have their sons circumcised say they do so for reasons
            of <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/FAQ/">cleanliness</a>.</p>

            <p>Dennis Harrison, another Vancouver resident, is one
            of the main spokespeople for the <a
            href="http://www.courtchallenge.com/"
            target="_blank">Association for Genital Integrity</a>,
            a Canadian group committed to raising public awareness
            of the issues surrounding infant male circumcision. His
            group applied for funding to start a legal process to
            end what he describes as unjust genital mutilation. The
            group was turned down and is now appealing the
            process.</p>

            <p>"I think the whole thing hinges on the cultural
            perception of the foreskin as being just a problem
            waiting to happen. The 'circumcision decision' is then
            framed as 'Do we get rid of it at birth, or expose the
            kid to the risk of urinary tract infections, cancer and
            God knows what else?' On the surface, this seems like a
            rational approach but it's analogous to 'Do we chop off
            the little finger at birth, or wait for it to get
            caught in the car door or develop cancer?' You could
            use this logical framework to justify cutting off
            practically anything, because what body part never
            causes problems?" he says.</p>

            <p>The medical profession has undergone a radical
            change of opinion regarding circumcision over the past
            few years. The <a href="http://www.cpsbc.ca"
            target="_blank">College of Physicians and Surgeons of
            British Columbia</a> published a <a
            href="http://www.cpsbc.ca/cps/physician_resources/publications/resource_manual/malecircum"
             target="_blank">paper</a> in 2004 stating that due to
            insufficient proof of its benefits, "routine infant
            male circumcision, i.e. routine removal of normal
            tissue in a healthy infant, is not recommended."</p>

            <p><b>The snip in Saskatchewan</b></p>

            <p>In February 2002, the <a
            href="http://www.quadrant.net/cpss/"
            target="_blank">College of Physicians in
            Saskatchewan</a> issued a much more strongly worded <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/sask2002/">
            memo</a> on the subject that states:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>In spite of the fact that the <a
              href="http://www.cps.ca" target="_blank">Canadian
              Pediatric Society</a> (CPS) has for two and a half
              decades explicitly cautioned against routine
              circumcision of newborn male infants, 27.6 per cent
              of newborn males were circumcised in the province in
              2000-2001.</p>

              <p>Since August 1996, infant circumcision has not
              been a publicly insured service in Saskatchewan. The
              decision to de-insure the service was based partly on
              the lack of valid medical indications for the
              procedure.</p>

              <p>Even though citizens must now personally pay for
              this service, the incidence of routine male
              circumcision has dropped only moderately over the
              past five years.</p>

              <p>It is difficult to identify any other domain of
              medicine in which physicians would feel comfortable
              playing such a passive role in a decision pathway
              culminating in surgery. It is also difficult to
              identify any other domain of medicine in which
              practice patterns stand in such stark contrast to
              research evidence.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>At present, no regional, national or international
            public health authority in the western world advocates
            the routine circumcision of children, either male or
            female. However, several studies have found some
            medical advantages for the practice. One study found
            that "male circumcision is associated with a
            significantly reduced risk of HIV infection among men
            in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly those at high risk
            of HIV," but the study does point out that circumcision
            does not prevent HIV infection. Others found <a
            href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=1492935&amp;dopt=Abstract">
            little</a> or <a
            href="http://www.update-software.com/abstracts/AB003362.htm"
             target="_blank">no</a> difference in HIV rates for
            circumcised men. Still, many non-medical people assume
            there is a sound medical basis for circumcising infant
            boys.</p>

            <p>"I find the anatomical aspect very interesting,"
            continues Harrison. "When medicalized circumcision
            first took off, 100 years ago or so, the foreskin could
            [supposedly] potentially cause everything from
            curvature of the spine to insanity. Then for a while
            the foreskin became nothing -- a mere 'fold of skin.'
            Now it's something again, but it 'causes' AIDS. So the
            anatomy keeps changing, as required to support
            circumcision. Suggestions that the foreskin has useful
            functions are ignored or downplayed."</p>

            <p><b>Useful tip</b></p>

            <p>It was another Canadian, Dr. John Taylor, who first
            started doing research into just what those useful
            functions might be. While the dense collection of nerve
            endings in female genitalia (the so-called "g-spot")
            had been a focus of research and discussion for some
            decades already, it wasn't until the mid-'90s that Dr.
            Taylor published his first study in what he has called
            the "<a
            href="http://research.cirp.org/index-e.html">ridged
            band</a>." The ridged band is a ring of deeply
            corrugated or ridged mucous membrane lining the tip of
            the foreskin.</p>

            <p>Initially, Dr. Taylor was interested in studying the
            tissue in order to help him make an informed decision
            about circumcising his own children. What he found was
            that the foreskin is actually a highly specialized
            tissue that is comparable to an eyelid; foreskins are
            actually used in <a
            href="http://www.sexuallymutilatedchild.org/f4sale.htm"
            target="_blank">eyelid replacement surgery</a>. Dr.
            Taylor says that when you remove the foreskin you are
            removing "half of the skin of the penis," and large
            amounts of specialized mucosa, which has in it
            specialized nerve endings called genital nerve endings.
            In simple language, according to Dr. Taylor's research,
            it is the man's foreskin that is analogous to the
            clitoris -- not the glans or head as is widely
            believed.</p>

            <p>In an <a href="http://www.intact.ca/taylor.html"
            target="_blank">interview</a> by Intact, an
            organization that seeks to end non-therapeutic male
            infant circumcision, Dr. Taylor was quoted as stating,
            "I think if you remove the vast bulk of the software
            from your penis, then you're going to suffer. If you
            lose all your specialized sensory nerve endings, and
            then the mechanism, the skin, and the rest of the penis
            that makes these nerve endings work, during sexual
            intercourse, or whatever, then you'll suffer. Obviously
            people who are circumcised don't miss what they've
            never had. It's like someone who was born blind, I
            guess. Now whether that's because they compensate, or
            do it in some different way, I don't know. No one
            knows."</p>

            <p>While most people think of the foreskin as a fairly
            small section of skin, Dr. Taylor's research indicates
            that the proportion is relatively large for a baby. In
            a female, the equivalent would be about the same as
            removing the clitoral hood and labia, a practice that
            most of the westernized world openly abhors.</p>

            <p><b>What's good for the goose</b></p>

            <p>Several doctors and lawyers told <i>The Tyee</i>
            that Canadian doctors are increasingly being asked to
            circumcise girls. By law, doctors cannot perform the
            surgery since even though male circumcision is still
            legal in North America, female circumcision has been
            banned through protective legislation in both Canada
            and the U.S. But doctors are being asked to do the
            operation anyway in order to respect the religious and
            cultural beliefs of the families. Anti-circumcision
            advocates say this begs the question: when there is no
            medical reason to perform the surgery for either sex,
            why do most Canadians consider the practice to be
            mutilation for women, and not for men?</p>

            <p>"While a doctor would never perform a vasectomy on a
            baby -- which is reversible," Tinari states, "you can
            get a circumcision done, which is not. Male
            circumcision is a feminist issue: as long as the door
            is open to male circumcision, then it is also open to
            female."</p>

            <p><b>'Conspiracy of silence'</b></p>

            <p>Tinari argues that "there is a conspiracy of silence
            around circumcision. First of all, the men who have
            been circumcised don't want to admit that there might
            be anything wrong with them, and they certainly
            wouldn't want to face that they had made a bad decision
            for their sons."</p>

            <p>Tinari claims that "circumcision is also a
            multi-billion-dollar industry in Canada and the U.S."
            and that one doctor in the Lower Mainland of B.C.
            claims to have performed 20,000 circumcisions over the
            past decade, charging around $250 per procedure.</p>

            <p>"There is the resale value," says Tinari. He is
            referring to the fact that human foreskins are a highly
            valuable tissue that can be grown in a lab to the size
            of a football field.</p>

            <p>The foreskin has more blood cells and nerve endings
            than almost any other skin on the body. Most baby
            foreskins are used in insulin production, breathable
            bandages, and in the cosmetics industry. People like
            Tinari wonder why the sale of all other human tissue is
            considered illegal, or is highly regulated, yet doctors
            are allowed to remove healthy tissue without the
            patient's consent and against all medical
            recommendations, then sell it for profit in a
            for-profit industry.</p>

            <p>Dr. Tinari estimates that between the surgery and
            the foreskin's resale value, each foreskin is worth
            approximately $100,000. His intention is to launch a
            legal battle, which he will call "The Head Tax" in
            which he aims to restore at least 10 per cent of that
            figure to the portion of the 10 million men in Canada
            who had the procedure non-consensually. But while
            Tinari says the issue is a moral one, he aims to fight
            it on the financial front. "When the cost of lawsuits
            exceeds the money that they are making from the
            surgery, that is when it's going to end. It won't end
            before that. Some people will join the class action
            lawsuit for the money, and although I would hope they
            did for moral reasons.... I don't care why they
            join."</p>

            <p>As for his surgery? Tinari says he is very happy,
            "in every way," with his new skin.</p>
