            Problem</h2>
            Mon Oct 13, 2:38 PM ET 

            <p><i>By Alison McCook</i></p>

            <p>NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A few small incisions
            may be all that are needed to fix a common foreskin
            problem in children, and <span class="yellow">avoid
            circumcision</span>, according to Austrian
            researchers.</p>

            <p>The new technique is used to treat phimosis, a
            condition in which the foreskin opening is too small
            for it to be pulled back over the head of the penis.
            Phimosis can affect 8 percent of boys between the ages
            of 6 and 7.</p>

            <p>Although phimosis can resolve by itself, it is often
            treated by circumcision, in which the foreskin is
            surgically removed. <span class="yellow">However,
            circumcision carries a risk of complications, and is
            fraught with controversy; in recent years, vocal
            opponents have lobbied against the procedure, equating
            it with mutilation.</span></p>

            <p>Consequently, a number of alternatives to
            circumcision have emerged to treat phimosis in young
            children. Results of the newest approach, known as
            triple incision plasty, are described in the medical
            journal BJU International.</p>

            <p>During the procedure, doctors make three separate
            longitudinal incisions around the tight ring of the
            foreskin, then suture the incisions obliquely. This
            results in a looser, slightly shorter foreskin that can
            move easily up and down over the head of the penis.</p>

            <p>"The foreskin will be preserved, only the tight ring
            of skin will be widened," study author Dr. Michael
            Rauchenwald of the General Hospital in St. Poelten told
            Reuters Health.</p>

            <p>The <a
            href="/library/treatment/phimosis/fischer-klein1/">report</a>
            describes the results of triple incision plasties
            performed on 197 boys with phimosis.</p>

            <p>Surveys of 128 parents and children showed that 84
            percent were satisfied with how their child's penis
            functioned, and 80 percent were happy with how it
            looked after surgery. Ninety-three percent of parents
            said they would recommend the operation to other
            parents.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">And in follow-up examinations
            of 91 children months after surgery, 77 percent had
            penises that looked and functioned normally.</span></p>

            <p>At the time the article was published, only three
            children had eventually undergone circumcision, because
            they were not happy with the results of the triple
            incision plasty.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Rauchenwald told Reuters Health
            that most men are not circumcised in Europe, and many
            European parents prefer their children to remain
            uncircumcised so that they don't feel
            different.</span></p>

            <p>While in many cases phimosis resolves on its own,
            Rauchenwald added that he believed all of the children
            included in the current study needed the operation, and
            he would recommend the surgery to many others.</p>
