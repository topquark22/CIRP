      <h2>Doctor is arrested over death of patient</h2>
      <b>BY PAUL WILKINSON</b> 

      <p>A DOCTOR has been arrested after a three-year inquiry into
      the death of a man during a routine operation.</p>

      <p>Dr Pravin Chaturbhai Patel, who worked at Shotley Bridge
      Hospital, in Consett, Co Durham, at the time of the surgery
      was held at his home in Harrow, northwest London, on
      suspicion of manslaughter. He was released on police
      bail.</p>

      <p>A police investigation was begun in July 1997 after Andrew
      Ryan, 20, of Durham, a muscular dystrophy sufferer, died
      during what should have been a routine 15-minute
      circumcision. Dr Patel, 50, had administered four local
      anaesthetic injections.</p>

      <p>At the inquest the North Durham Coroner recorded a verdict
      of misadventure. A post-mortem examination indicated death by
      natural causes, due to respiratory failure and heart
      problems. The inquest was told conflicting evidence about the
      amount of the anaesthetic, lignocaine, which was injected
      into Mr Ryan.</p>
