      <h1>Call to cut misconduct at circumcision schools</h1>
      <b>SAKHILE MOKOENA Pietersburg | Thursday</b> 

      <p>CIRCUMCISION schools should be regulated without
      "assassinating" African culture and customs, urged Pan
      Africanist Youth Congress (Payco) leader in the Northern
      Province, Matome Mashao, on Thursday. His call follows the
      cancellation of a provincial circumcision indaba, or meeting,
      that was to be held on Tuesday but was scuppered when
      traditional healers and leaders said it would violate the
      secrecy of the schools.</p>

      <p>Eight boys have died at circumcision schools in the
      Northern Province this winter. They died of complications
      after being circumcised with razor blades.</p>

      <p>Mashao said Payco was not opposed to circumcision or rites
      of passage into manhood, but that did oppose unscrupulous
      circumcision school owners interested only in making a
      profit.</p>

      <p>"We would like to see the unscrupulous owners of the
      schools being brought to book for any misconduct or
      negligence," he explained. He added: "It is fundamentally
      wrong for anyone to start the schools for business. They must
      want to preserve culture, manhood development and consider
      medical aspects," he said.</p>

      <p>The virulence of Aids required that circumcision schools
      be properly regulated to ensure that razor blades were not
      used on more than one initiate.</p>

      <p>"Given the Aids pandemic the schools can no longer
      continue unregulated," Mashao explained.</p>

      <p>Representative for the MEC in the premier's office, Lucky
      Nchabeleng, assured traditional leaders that the indaba would
      not have violated the secrecy of the initiation rites.</p>

      <p>"The indaba was not aimed at discussing the contents of
      the schools, it was meant to seek ways of preventing the
      deaths that are taking place in the schools," he said.</p>

      <p>The indaba is expected to be rescheduled once officials
      have met with traditional leaders and healers. - African Eye
