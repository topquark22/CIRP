            <p>The Forum -- 02/14/2003</p>

            <p>A circumcision lawsuit against Fargo's <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Hospital</a> was dismissed
            Thursday after a judge ruled the hospital is not
            responsible for informing patients about the
            procedure.</p>

            <p>A jury, however, will still decide whether <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734"
            target="_blank">Dr. Sunita Kantak</a> properly
            informed Anita Flatt about the risks and benefits of
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>MeritCare Attorney <a
            href="http://www.vogellaw.com/fsl5cs/XMLAttorneyProfile.asp?guid=I30B624CE1DD211B2A40BB0001207C554&amp;ind_wld_id=3185802"
            target="_blank">Angela Lord</a> made the motion to
            dismiss after the plaintiffs called their last witness
            Thursday.</p>

            <p>Lord argued the plaintiffs failed to prove MeritCare
            is responsible for obtaining patient informed
            consent.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/COURT/DISTRICTS/EC.HTM"
            target="_blank">East Central District Court</a> Judge
            <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/Rothe-Seeger.htm">
            Cynthia Rothe-Seeger</a> agreed.</p>

            <p>She ruled even though the hospital provides the
            room, tools and nurses, obtaining informed consent is
            the legal responsibility of the doctor.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.zbaer.com/anita.htm"
            target="_blank">Flatt</a> of <a
            href="http://www.hawley.govoffice.com/"
            target="_blank">Hawley</a>, Minn., sued Kantak and
            MeritCare Hospital in <a
            href="http://www.co.cass.nd.us/" target="_blank">Cass
            County</a> District Court, claiming she and her
            husband, James, weren't told complete and accurate
            information about removing the foreskin from their
            son's penis.</p>

            <p>Flatt says she never received the booklet MeritCare
            gives out to parents, and only talked to Kantak briefly
            about the pain involved before the procedure was
            performed.</p>

            <p>Had Flatt understood the risks of the procedure, she
            wouldn't have had it done, she said.</p>

            <p>"My theory was the nurses, who were employees of the
            hospital, were agents of Sunita Kantak to obtain
            consent," Flatt attorney <a
            href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a> said after court
            recessed for the day.</p>

            <p>Baer said the ruling does not "mean all that much
            from a practical standpoint."</p>

            <p>The decision, for instance, would not impact the
            amount of money a jury could award Flatt if Kantak was
            found liable, Baer said.</p>

            <p>MeritCare officials left the trial without
            commenting on Rothe-Seeger's ruling.</p>

            <p>Rothe-Seeger did not grant Lord's motion to dismiss
            Kantak from the lawsuit.</p>

            <p>Lord argued that under North Dakota law, doctors are
            not required to disclose all possible risks or minor
            risks to patients.</p>

            <p>In addition, she said, the potential risks Baer has
            named, like amputation of the penis, meningitis and
            death, didn't occur in this case.</p>

            <p>Flatt's son, Lord said, has a normal, functioning
            penis.</p>

            <p>Rothe-Seeger did not explain why she didn't drop
            Kantak from the lawsuit.</p>

            <p>The jury will not be told about Rothe-Seeger's
            ruling on MeritCare until after closing statements,
            which are expected today.</p>

            <p>Baer spent Thursday morning questioning Kantak and
            Flatt.</p>

            <p>He asked Kantak if her talk to parents on
            circumcision has changed since December 1999 when Flatt
            filed the lawsuit.</p>

            <p>Nurses and doctors have testified Kantak gives a
            thorough discussion on circumcisions.</p>

            <p>Kantak said her circumcision talk has not
            significantly changed.</p>

            <p>During cross examination, Kantak said she talked to
            Flatt about circumcision on March 6, 1997, the day
            before the procedure.</p>

            <p>She said there is documentation to prove it. Flatt
            alleges her first visit with Kantak was on March 7.</p>

            <p>Kantak said it's not procedure for doctors to go
            over every possible risk of circumcision unless
            specifically asked by the parent.</p>

            <p>Kantak also said she doesn't recall there being a
            complication from circumcision in her 15 years at
            MeritCare.</p>

            <p>Flatt, who was recalled to testify, said Kantak did
            not talk about risks like asymmetry and skin adhesions,
            both which her son suffered from.</p>

            <p>She said she wouldn't have consented to the
            procedure had she known about the risks.</p>

            <p>Two MeritCare doctors testified Thursday afternoon
            that asymmetry and adhesions are very common, won't
            impact function and aren't considered a concern.</p>

            <p>The adhesions have already been treated and the
            asymmetry will most likely be unnoticeable by the time
            the boy reaches puberty, they said.</p>

            <p>The case is expected to be handed over to the jury
            for deliberation this afternoon.</p>
