            <h4>Province has second-lowest rate in the country</h4>

            <p><b>By Andrea MacDonald<br />
             The Daily News</b></p>

            <p>Baby boys in Nova Scotia are among the least likely
            in Canada to be circumcised, new data show.</p>

            <p>The controversial practice has been plummeting since
            the 1970s, with this province posting the country's
            second-lowest rates in the most recent figures
            available.</p>

            <p>In 2003, just 1.1 per cent of baby boys born in Nova
            Scotia went under the knife. That figure had dropped
            even from the previous four years. (Newfoundland
            reported no circumcisions for 2003.)</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.courtchallenge.com/"
            target="_blank">Association for Genital Integrity</a>,
            a lobby group that's trying to outlaw circumcision
            unless it's medically necessary, compiled the data from
            health ministries and Statistics Canada.</p>

            <p><b><i>One proven benefit</i></b></p>

            <p>Their figures may not include circumcisions
            performed outside hospitals, such as those common at a
            Jewish ceremony called a <i>bris</i>.</p>

            <p>Only about three doctors in Halifax will perform
            circumcisions. The <a href="http://www.cps.ca"
            target="_blank">Canadian Pediatric Society</a> has
            spoken out against the practice, saying the only proven
            benefit is a lesser chance of urinary-tract
            infection.</p>

            <p>Halifax residents Susan MacDonald and Craig Clothier
            didn't think much about it until their son Jacob was
            born in September 2003, while they were living in
            Australia.</p>

            <p>MacDonald had a few minor complications with the
            birth, so the baby had already seen a pediatrician. The
            doctor was willing to circumcise, but felt it was a bit
            invasive.</p>

            <p>He told the couple he believed there was no real
            need because today's world is much more sterile.</p>

            <p><b><i>Didn't bother</i></b></p>

            <p>"We just kind of thought, 'OK, it sounds like he
            doesn't need it, so we won't bother,'" Clothier
            said.</p>

            <p>"We didn't have any kind of religious issues with
            it, or anything like that."</p>

            <p>MacDonald added:</p>

            <p>"The only thing we did worry a little bit about was,
            what if he's on a sports team or in the shower room and
            other boys make fun of him? What if he's the only one
            and has this sort of funny-looking penis?</p>

            <p>"But they told us down there that more people than
            not opted not to go through with the procedure.</p>

            <p>We thought, 'OK, he's going to at least be 50-50 if
            he's hanging around naked with some boys, so he should
            be OK.'"</p>

            <p>When the couple had another boy in March 2005, they
            wanted him to resemble his brother, so they opted not
            to circumcise him, either.</p>

            <p>Dennis Harrison, spokesman for the Association for
            Genital Integrity says circumcision is a human-rights
            issue:</p>

            <p>"Baby boys are the only group in society having
            medically unnecessary surgery without their
            consent."</p>
