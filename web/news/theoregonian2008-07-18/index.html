            <h2>Sacred ritual or genital mutilation?</h2>
            Friday, July 18, 2008 

            <p><b>The Oregonian</b></p>

            <p>Cara Ungar-Gutierrez's decision not to circumcise
            her son Enzo ("<a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/theoregonian2008-07-17B/"
             target="_blank">Circumcision: a painful decision</a>,"
            How We Live section, July 17) is her own to make;
            however, I seriously question her rationale that it was
            "the most Jewish decision I could make."<br />
            <br />
             If her sense of a "Jewish decision" is the tradition
            of asking challenging questions about every aspect of
            the religion and life, she might have a point. However,
            the act of circumcision is a ritual deeply embedded in
            the Jewish soul, marking Abraham's covenant with God
            and with the Jewish people.<br />
            <br />
             Those who have attended a bris milah ceremony can
            confirm that the crying that Ungar-Gutierrez would have
            felt uncomfortable with is momentary and the ritual is
            gentle and joyful.<br />
            <br />
             The alternative for Enzo is, if he chooses a Jewish
            life, to circumcise as an adult. What it means to be
            Jewish is complicated even for devout Jews.
            Communicating it to a Gentile world is a challenge.
            Your articles fell short of the mark.<br />
            <br />

            <br />
             I just read the interview with Cara Ungar-Gutierrez
            and I have tears in my eyes. As a Jewish woman and the
            mother of two college-age daughters, I thought back to
            the time of my pregnancy with my first daughter. We did
            not know if we were having a boy or a girl but I had
            decided that if I had a boy, he would not be
            circumcised. This choice caused much anger in my family
            and my then-husband's family.<br />
            <br />
             I have always been of the belief that I do not have
            the right to permanently alter my child's body with a
            cosmetic procedure and that the presence or lack of
            foreskin is not what makes a boy Jewish.<br />
            <br />
             Thank you to Ungar-Gutierrez for her strength and
            compassion. She is truly an inspiration to intactivist
            parents everywhere.<br />
            <br />
             TABITHA vonKUHLMANN North Portland Editor's note: An
            "intactivist" is "a person who participates in an
            activist group or as an individual for the rights of
            children to remain genitally intact,"
            www.urbandictionary.com.<br />
            <br />
             Religious circumcision be damned. Let's get real and
            call it for what it is: genital mutilation without
            anesthesia, inflicted upon a helpless human being
            without his consent.<br />
            <br />
             What galls me is the lack of public outrage,
            especially by feminists who vehemently oppose female
            circumcision. Genital mutilation is a barbaric practice
            and should be banned.<br />

            <br />
             The first rule in medical ethics is patient autonomy.
            Before physicians can perform any "elective" procedure,
            they must provide "informed consent." In performing
            infant circumcision this is impossible because the
            owner of the penis has no ability to have input into
            the decision process.<br />
            <br />
             This is the main reason that I quit doing
            circumcisions about 15 years ago.<br />
