            <h2>Supreme court turns away Oregon circumcision
            case</h2>
            by Ashbel S. Green, The Oregonian 

            <p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/"
            target="_blank">U.S. Supreme Court</a> today declined
            to take up an Oregon dispute between a father who wants
            to circumcise his 13-year-old son against the wishes of
            the boy's mother.<br />
            <br />
             The case now goes back to an Oregon trial judge to
            determine whether the boy wants to undergo the
            procedure.<br />
            <br />
             James Boldt, a former Southern Oregon resident who
            converted to Judaism, says his son wants to be
            circumcised for religious reasons.<br />
            <br />
             Lia Boldt claims her son is afraid to tell his father
            that he does not want to undergo the procedure.<br />
            <br />
             The Boldts married in the early 1990s. She filed for
            divorce in 1998.<br />
            <br />
             The boy initially lived with his mother, but the
            father later gained custody. James Boldt started
            studying Judaism in 1999 and eventually
            converted.<br />
            <br />
             James Boldt claims that as the custodial parent he has
            a constitutional right to raise his son in his
            religion.<br />
            <br />
             The <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/"
            target="_blank">Oregon Supreme Court</a> earlier this
            year did not rule on the substance of the dispute, but
            said the trial judge needed to determine the boy's
            wishes before deciding which parent to side with.</p>
