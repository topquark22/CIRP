            <h2>Circumcision is not the necessary procedure that
            many physicians think it is</h2>

            <p>By <b>Sarah Sorensen</b></p>

            <p>GUEST COLUMNIST</p>

            <p>I have learned that the average pediatrician has
            much to learn about circumcision. It starts with
            pediatricians' own organization, the American Academy
            of Pediatrics. It stated in <a
            href="/library/statements/aap/#a1971">1971</a> and <a
            href="/library/statements/aap/#a1975">1975</a> "there
            are no valid medical indication for circumcision in the
            neonatal period."</p>

            <p>Again in <a
            href="/library/statements/aap1999/">1999</a>, it said,
            "After looking at almost 40 years of research on the
            benefits and risks of circumcision, the AAP concluded
            that we cannot recommend a policy of routine newborn
            circumcision." For the first time, the AAP also
            recommends that pain relief be administered for the
            procedure.</p>

            <p>Removing the foreskin for hygiene reasons is a very
            common myth. Just as the eyelid protects and cleanses
            the eye, the foreskin provides the same function in the
            intact male. "In Taking Care of Your Child," by Barton
            Schmitt, the author states, "The overwhelming majority
            of uncircumcised (intact) boys never develop medical
            problems."</p>

            <p>There is a less than a 1 percent chance that
            circumcision will ever be medically necessary. Why is
            it more acceptable to surgically remove the foreskin
            than to teach proper hygiene to young boys?</p>

            <p>Thomas Szasz, M.D., states, "I believe the time has
            come to acknowledge that the practice of routine infant
            circumcision rests on the absurd premise that the only
            mammal in creation born in the condition that requires
            immediate surgical correction is the human male."</p>

            <p>There is a common opinion that circumcision later in
            life is more painful. When a newborn is circumcised the
            foreskin is forcibly separated, similar to the way a
            fingernail would have to be separated from the finger.
            As an adolescent or adult the foreskin has naturally
            detached, therefore requiring less cutting and trauma
            to delicate tissues.</p>

            <p>James Rouch stated in his April 3 letter to the
            editor "... recipients (of circumcision) are also much
            less likely to contract AIDS or other sexually
            transmitted diseases." The American Academy of
            Pediatrics in 1999 stated, "Behavioral factors appear
            to be far more important risk factors in the
            acquisition of HIV infection than circumcision
            status."</p>

            <p>In addition, the American Medical Association in <a
            href="/library/statements/ama2000/">2000</a> stated,
            "Behavioral factors are far more important risk factors
            for acquisition of HIV and other sexually transmissible
            diseases than circumcision status, and circumcision
            cannot be responsibly viewed as "protecting" against
            such infections."</p>

            <p>Mr. Rouch, I am not sure what you intended by your
            comment about female circumcision (clitorectomy). The
            Spectrum published an article on April 5 about a case
            in Georgia where a father is in jail for circumcising
            his 2-year-old daughter. Female circumcision is illegal
            in the United States and many other countries.</p>

            <p>Nonreligious routine infant circumcision (RIC)
            persists in America because it has become part of our
            culture. It has evolved into a purely cosmetic
            procedure. As an infant, he is forced to experience the
            parents' preference. Upon maturity, the son may not
            share the same preference. He may later conclude that
            if it had been left up to him, he would have preferred
            to remain intact.</p>

            <p>"The time has come to stop mutilating babies and to
            treat babies for what they are -- beings that are
            extremely precious and that should be treated with the
            same respect we give any person," said Paul Fleiss, a
            clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of
            Southern California Medical Center and co-author with
            Frederick Hodges of the new book, "What Your Doctor May
            Not Tell You About Circumcision."</p>

            <p>Circumcision violates the physicians golden rule:
            "First, do no harm." Circumcision is extremely painful
            for an infant. Tightening of the circumcision device
            puts crushing pressure on a large area of sensitive
            skin. Anesthesia to remove pain during circumcision is
            mostly a matter of guesswork. Lidocaine or Prilocaine
            is injected into the dorsal nerve. It is very difficult
            for a doctor to judge whether the anesthetic has been
            administered effectively as the patient is unable to
            effectively communicate or protect himself.</p>

            <p>Circumcision also violates a basic human right, the
            right to an intact body. The infant has the right to
            not have normal body parts removed without his express
            consent. Circumcision is irreversible. Healthy, fully
            functional tissue is removed from a helpless baby. The
            question whether parents have the right to consent to
            this unnecessary procedure has been decided in a New
            York courtroom in the case of William Stowell. <a
            href="http://firms.findlaw.com//llewellynlaw/practices.htm"
            target="_blank">David J. Llewellyn</a>, attorney for
            William Stowell, stated, "Never again can someone say
            that a young man who is dissatisfied with his
            circumcision as an infant is being frivolous when he
            objects to his mutilation and brings suit to obtain
            justice. This case should send a message to doctors
            that they run the risk of a lawsuit each time they
            circumcise an infant for non-therapeutic reasons." Let
            us begin every child's life free from unnecessary pain.
            It is their right.</p>
