            <p>The Forum - 02/04/2003</p>

            <p>Potential jurors in a trial that could determine
            what hospitals must disclose about infant circumcision
            were quizzed Monday about the procedure.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Attorney Zenas Baer</a> asked jury
            candidates to raise their hand if they consented to
            have their infant circumcised.</p>

            <p>Of the 18 potential jurors, 12 responded.</p>

            <p>Each of those candidates were then asked by Baer
            about the experience: How did they come to the
            conclusion to have their son circumcised? Did the
            doctor or nurse tell them about the procedure? Did the
            doctor give a medical reason for circumcision? Did they
            know the risks of circumcision?</p>

            <p>And finally, "Is there anything about the subject
            matter that would make you squeamish?"</p>

            <p>"No," a middle-aged woman responded. "It's
            2003."</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.zbaer.com/anita.htm"
            target="_blank">Anita Flatt</a> of Hawley, Minn., is
            suing <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734"
             target="_blank">Dr. Sunita Kantak</a>, Fargo-based <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Hospital</a> and the state of
            North Dakota claiming she and her husband, James,
            weren't told complete and accurate information about
            removing the foreskin from their son's penis.</p>

            <p>Anita Flatt signed a circumcision consent form, but
            hospital staff didn't describe the benefits or risks of
            the procedure, the lawsuit says.</p>

            <p>She wouldn't have consented to the procedure had she
            known what it entailed, Flatt said.</p>

            <p>The trial opened Monday in Cass County District
            Court before <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/Rothe-Seeger.htm"
             target="_blank">Judge Cynthia Rothe-Seeger</a>.</p>

            <p>Flatt, now an attorney in Baer's law firm, and
            Kantak were present in the courtroom.</p>

            <p>Most of the potential jurors told Baer the decision
            to circumcise their infant was made jointly with their
            spouse.</p>

            <p>But one elderly woman said her son was circumcised
            because that's what was done to infant boys in her
            day.</p>

            <p>"I'm from the old school," she said.</p>

            <p>Another admitted she did it in part because of
            "locker room syndrome," or because she didn't want her
            son to be different from other boys.</p>

            <p>"What I am getting at is most of these folks made
            the decision (to circumcise) without any information or
            very little information," Baer said after the trial
            recessed for the day.</p>

            <p>Also, those who consented to the procedure could
            possibly interpret the lawsuit as a slam on their
            decision to circumcise, he said.</p>

            <p>"Nobody wants to believe they did something to harm
            their newborn infant," he said.</p>

            <p>Another of Baer's major points involved frivolous
            lawsuits.</p>

            <p>Baer asked candidates whether they would feel
            pressure to rule a certain way because of the
            uniqueness of the case.</p>

            <p>While most jurors indicated they felt there was too
            much litigation in America today, they said they could
            listen to the facts of the case without bias.</p>

            <p>"One thing that is important to note is that most of
            the people that talk about frivolous lawsuits don't
            know the facts," Baer said after the hearing.</p>

            <p>Baer said he will conclude his questioning of jury
            candidates today. The defense will then have an
            opportunity ask jurors questions.</p>

            <p>Of the 18 candidates, eight will be dismissed. One
            person will be kept on as an alternate.</p>

            <p>Baer expects opening statements to begin today. The
            trial is expected to last two weeks.</p>

            <p>MeritCare officials left the courtroom without
            commenting.</p>

            <p>"What has come through is most of the people that
            made the decision made it with very incomplete
            information," Baer said. "They made a decision that
            permanently altered their son's genitals, and they are
            thinking about that - and that is the best we can
            do."</p>
