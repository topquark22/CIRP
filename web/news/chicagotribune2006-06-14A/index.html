            Chicago.</h2>

            <p>By CARLA K. JOHNSON<br />
             Associated Press Writer<br />
             Published June 14, 2006, 3:48 PM CDT</p>

            <p>CHICAGO -- Groups opposed to circumcision are
            watching the case of an 8-year-old suburban Chicago boy
            whose divorced parents are fighting in court over
            whether he should have the procedure.</p>

            <p>The child's mother wants him circumcised to prevent
            recurring, painful inflammation she says he's
            experienced during the past year. But the father says
            the boy is healthy and circumcision, which removes the
            foreskin of the penis, is an unnecessary medical
            procedure that could cause him long-term physical and
            psychological harm.</p>

            <p>"The child is absolutely healthy," the father said
            during a break in a court hearing on the matter
            Wednesday. "I do not want any doctor to butcher my
            son."</p>

            <p>The mother testified that her son has had five bouts
            of painful inflammation and has begged her to help him.
            Her son cannot wear underwear or jeans during the bouts
            and is comfortable only in loose-fitting pajamas, she
            said.</p>

            <p>"My child was in the bathroom crying. He asked me to
            come in because his penis did not look normal," she
            said, describing one of the episodes.</p>

            <p>The couple's 2003 divorce decree gave the father the
            right to offer input on medical decisions. Earlier this
            year, he sued to block the surgery and Cook County
            Judge Jordan Kaplan ordered the mother not to have the
            boy circumcised until he could hear from both parents
            and the opinions of doctors who've examined the
            boy.</p>

            <p>The Associated Press is not naming the parents to
            protect the child's privacy. The father was born and
            raised in Poland. She is from Slovakia.</p>

            <p>The case reflects a national debate over the medical
            necessity of circumcision. In 1999, the <a
            href="http://www.aap.org" target="_blank">American
            Academy of Pediatrics</a> reversed its support for
            routine infant circumcision, citing questionable
            benefits and medical and anecdotal evidence that
            circumcised men have less penile sensitivity.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.lawyers.com/lawyers/Atlanta/Georgia/David%20J.%20Llewellyn/attorney.html?a=0761-LDS&amp;co=&amp;b=A101006875805"
             target="_blank">David Llewellyn</a>, an Atlanta
            attorney who specializes in circumcision cases, is
            helping the father's attorneys without fee. He called
            the surgery "a bizarre American custom."</p>

            <p>Most U.S. newborn boys are circumcised before they
            leave the hospital. But a growing number of parents are
            opting against the surgery. The percentage of male
            babies circumcised has fallen from an estimated 90
            percent in 1970 to about 60 percent today.</p>

            <p>Roger Saquet, director of the Non-Circumcision
            Information Center in Belmont, Mass., said he heard
            about the case from others who promote leaving boys'
            foreskins intact.</p>

            <p>"I can't imagine an 8-year-old boy to be forced to
            go to a hospital and have his genitals mutilated," he
            said.</p>

            <p>Saquet criticized the parents for letting their
            dispute escalate.</p>

            <p>"They're using the kid as a weapon against each
            other," he said. "It's really sad. My heart goes out to
            that kid."</p>

            <p>Tracy Rizzo, the mother's attorney, said religion,
            not medicine, is the father's concern. Rizzo said the
            father disagrees with circumcision because he resents
            the fact that his ex-wife has remarried a Jewish man.
            The mother lives with her new husband, her son and her
            husband's son from a previous relationship in
            Northbrook.</p>

            <p>The father, an Arlington Heights resident, denies
            he's concerned about the religion of his ex-wife's
            husband.</p>

            <p>The mother testified Wednesday that she wanted the
            boy circumcised when he was a newborn, but her
            then-husband refused. She quoted him as saying at the
            time: "There is no way my son is going to be
            circumcised. He is not a Jew."</p>

            <p>But the judge would not allow Alan Toback, an
            attorney for the father, to ask the new husband, who
            also testified Wednesday, if he is circumcised.</p>

            <p>"We're not going there," the judge said.</p>

            <p>In a March 1999 <a
            href="http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;103/3/686"
             target="_blank">policy statement</a> that was
            reaffirmed this year, the American Academy of
            Pediatrics said there are "potential medical benefits"
            to circumcision, including a reduction in risk of
            urinary tract infections. However, existing data "are
            not sufficient to recommend routine ... circumcision"
            of newborns, the statement says.</p>

            <p>The group estimates that 1.2 million newborn males
            are circumcised in the United States a year at a cost
            of between $150 million and $270 million.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.luhs.org/depts/urology/html/hatch.htm"
            target="_blank">Dr. David Hatch</a>, a pediatric
            urologist who testified Wednesday, said he performs 250
            circumcisions a year, including about 20 on boys
            between the ages of 5 and 10.</p>

            <p>Hatch testified his own three sons are uncircumcised
            because he does not think it is normally medically
            necessary. But he said he would recommend circumcision
            for a son with a history of recurring inflammation or
            infection.</p>
