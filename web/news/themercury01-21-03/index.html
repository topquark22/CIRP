            <p>January 21, 2003</p>

            <p>Qena: A doctor in Egypt accidentally cut off the
            penis of a 10-year-old boy during a botched
            circumcision, court sources said yesterday.</p>

            <p>The doctor, from a hospital in Abu Tasht, 500km
            south of Cairo, had been summoned before prosecutors
            for questioning, they said. He had reportedly sliced
            off part of the boy's penis before removing it entirely
            when he tried to stitch the wound that had begun to
            bleed.</p>

            <p>The boy was taken by his father to a traditional
            practitioner to undergo the procedure in the belief
            that there would be no risk. - Sapa-AFP</p>
