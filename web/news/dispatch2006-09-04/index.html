          <h2>Ban circumcision schools &ndash; pastor</h2>

          <h4>Ungodly practices are taking place at them, he says,
          including initiates eating their own foreskins</h4>

          <p>By ANELISA NGCAKANI</p>

          <p>AN East London pastor is waging a campaign to stop
          circumcision ceremonies.</p>

          <p>Senior pastor Ndipiwe Mcoteli, of the Burning Bush
          Ministries in Braelynn, said his drive began in response
          to the deaths in initiation schools and also because he
          believes ungodly practices take place.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;Another reason is that once the young men from
          our church came back from initiation schools they didn't
          want to serve God or live morally any more.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>He claims muti is used and this was contrary to the
          Bible. &ldquo;Traditional medicine is used there. Evil
          practices are done there. In some cases young boys are
          told to eat their own foreskin after it is cut off
          &ndash; that is cannibalism.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>Mcoteli, who was circumcised in his youth, said some
          young men seemed to lose respect for their parents and
          elders because after initiation they considered
          themselves to be adults.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;A boy who was not drinking before starts
          drinking when he comes back and all of a sudden they
          become promiscuous because they say it is their right as
          a man.</p>
          &ldquo;Boys are told that when they get out, the first
          thing they must do is sleep with a girl to pass on their
          bad luck and that they must never sleep with her again.
          What is this promoting?&rdquo;<br />
          <br />
           

          <p>Evangelist Daniel Ekechukwu says he had to counsel a
          young man whose mother came to him, weeping
          &ldquo;telling me her son had been serving God, but after
          coming from initiation school he started drinking&rdquo;.
          He had also been told &ldquo;by people who have been
          there themselves&rdquo; about initiates eating their own
          foreskins.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;This has been a closely guarded secret. But
          people who have been there themselves have told me that
          they ate their foreskins because they didn&rsquo;t want
          the traditional doctors to use them in muti,&rdquo; he
          said.</p>

          <p>Chief Justice Mabandla, a representative of the
          Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders in the national
          House of Traditional Leaders, said he had heard from
          reliable sources that eating foreskins did happen in some
          instances. They believe &ldquo;witches will take part of
          the skin to use for witchcraft&rdquo;.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;This is superstition and those who do it must
          be called to book.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>However, he dismissed claims that initiation changed a
          person&rsquo;s behaviour, causing them to drink or become
          promiscuous. And he believed circumcision rituals were an
          important rite of passage to manhood.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;This is our culture,&rdquo; he said.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;As Xhosas we believe there is a stage where a
          boy is a schoolboy and there is also a stage where he
          should qualify as an adult. The circumcision ceremony is
          where a boy lets go of the habits of boyhood and takes on
          the habits of manhood.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>He acknowledged that, in some cases, youths were told
          to sleep with young women to pass on their bad luck, but
          this was only in cases where traditional surgeons were
          ignorant.</p>

          <p>Both Mcoteli and Ekechukwu believe youths should go to
          a medical doctor if they wanted to be circumcised.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;Circumcision is just healthy and we encourage
          our men to do at a hospital because it is
          hygienic,&rdquo; said Mcoteli.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;The removal of a foreskin does not make you a
          man but responsibility towards your community and family
          does.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>Mcebisi Xundu, president of the Eastern Cape Council
          of Churches disagrees: &ldquo;Circumcision is a part of
          our culture (and) it is part of what defines a man, even
          if you are a Christian.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>But, he said, if young men were taught immoral
          behaviour at initiation schools the Church needed to
          intervene to build a godly character in them. He
          condemned the use of muti &ldquo;if indeed this
          happens&rdquo;.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;We cannot support it and in fact medical
          doctors must do the circumcision. It&rsquo;s either that
          they should circumcise the boys at the bush or in their
          homes.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>Luxolo Mkosana, 23, said he decided not to go to
          initiation school because this was not what defined him
          as a man. &ldquo;A man is someone who looks to add value
          to the community, who makes a positive contribution to
          the people around him, who is a good role model to the
          next generation ... someone who fears, respects and does
          the will of God.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>He believes circumcision &ldquo;mainly has to do with
          honouring your ancestors, which is contrary to the word
          of God, because we honour Jesus Christ, not people who
          have passed away. Ancestors never helped me when I went
          through difficult times.&rdquo;</p>
