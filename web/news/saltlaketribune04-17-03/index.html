            <h2>More Parents Questioning Routine Infant
            Circumcision</h2>

            <p class="first">There are roughly 25,000 baby boys
            being born a year in Utah and in the first few days of
            life, most go through the same painful experience.</p>

            <p>You know what we are talking about. Yeah, ouch.
            Circumcision.</p>

            <p>For Utah's Jews and Muslims, circumcision is a
            matter of religious faith. But for most new parents,
            the practice is part of a Western medicine and cultural
            tradition that has deemed the foreskin useless and
            expendable. (See box, D3.)</p>

            <p>And that's a big mistake, according to
            anti-circumcision advocates, whose view is gaining
            momentum as the slim flap of skin is increasingly the
            focus of welfare reform, legal challenges and
            preference for holistic health practices.</p>

            <p>In February, <span class="yellow">Utah joined 10
            other states in eliminating Medicaid funding for
            circumcision</span>, saving more than $350,000
            annually, according to the <a
            href="http://hlunix.ex.state.ut.us/"
            target="_blank">Utah Health Department</a>. Other
            states are said to be lining up to adopt similar
            measures and if they do, the savings to Medicaid would
            be about $35 million annually, according to the
            Circumcision Information and Resource Pages Web
            site.</p>

            <p>Such policy reform has the backing of individuals
            and groups opposed to circumcision, though they say the
            debate is more about human rights than about public
            funds.</p>

            <p>"The time has come to stop mutilating babies and to
            treat babies for what they are&mdash;beings that are
            extremely precious and that should be treated with the
            same respect we give any person," said Paul Fleiss, a
            clinical professor of pediatrics at the <a
            href="http://www.usc.edu/patient_care/hospitals/lac_usc/"
             target="_blank">University of Southern California
            Medical Center</a> and co-author with Frederick Hodges
            of the new book <i>What Your Doctor May Not Tell You
            About Circumcision</i>.</p>

            <p>Fleiss came to the cause by what he described as an
            epiphany. His early training taught him babies didn't
            see, hear or feel pain. Through hundreds of
            circumcisions, he focused on the procedure and screened
            out the "agonizing, horrifying cry" from the baby.</p>

            <p>"When I finally did hear the cry, I knew nothing
            good was coming out of it," he said.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.aap.org/"
            target="_blank">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>,
            which until the 1970s was a proponent of circumcision,
            reiterated in 1999 there is no medical reason to make
            the surgery routine for all infant boys. The academy
            said, however, parents should be allowed to take
            cultural, religious and ethnic traditions into account
            when deciding whether to circumcise a son. And for the
            first time, the academy recommended that pain relief be
            provided during the surgery.</p>

            <p>Circumcision is required to treat some physical
            conditions, such as <a
            href="/library/treatment/phimosis/">phimosis</a> in
            which the foreskin is so tight it won't retract from
            the penis, and some research shows uncircumcised males
            are at more risk of urinary-tract infections, sexually
            transmitted disease and penile cancer. But the academy
            concluded that all those risks are extremely low and do
            not warrant making circumcision standard practice.</p>

            <p>Still, scientific fact is up against cultural
            conformity when it comes to circumcision.</p>

            <p>Roughly 80 percent of adult American men are
            circumcised and the preference has been for "like
            father, like son"&mdash;with much thought given to what
            a boy may face later in the school locker room. Even
            so, circumcision rates have fallen to somewhere between
            55 percent and 65 percent nationally, according to
            information groups.</p>

            <p>That decline is due in part to public education
            efforts by groups such as the National Organization of
            Circumcision Information Resource Center (<a
            href="http://www.nocirc.org/">NOCIRC</a>), founded in
            1986 by Marilyn Milos to protect the rights of male,
            female and intersex children until they are old enough
            to decide for themselves how they want their genitals
            to be treated.</p>

            <p>Utah may be behind the national curve.</p>

            <p>"I don't think there is any appreciable decrease in
            the number of circumcisions done, but people are
            definitely thinking about it and asking questions about
            it more often than they did 10 years ago," said Louis
            Borgenicht, a Salt Lake City pediatrician and co-author
            with son Joe of the just-published The Baby Owner's
            Manual.</p>

            <p>Heidi and Bob Varechok of Park City are typical of
            the couples showing up in local doctors offices. The
            Varechoks are expecting their second child in August
            and learned last Friday they will have their first
            son.</p>

            <p>"It's one of those things we didn't have to deal
            with [when we had] our little girl," Bob Varechok
            said.</p>

            <p>The couple plan to discuss circumcision with Heidi's
            obstetrician and their pediatrician and will be guided
            by what they say, but right now "we have no
            preconceived ideas one way or the other going into
            this," Bob Varechok said.</p>

            <p>Based on his experience, Borgenicht said parents who
            opt against having their baby boys circumcised are "at
            peace with the fact that they really don't have to from
            a medical standpoint" and tend to be "new age people
            who are more into counterculture medicine."</p>

            <p>Fleiss said a small number of physicians cling to
            the idea there are medical reasons to do a
            circumcision, but most "do what parents want them to
            do."</p>

            <p>It's more than a matter of cultural preference for
            Jews and Muslims, who consider circumcision part of a
            covenant God made with Abraham.</p>

            <p>"My denomination in general on these issues is
            pro-individual choice," said Rabbi Joshua Aaronson of
            <a href="http://www.uahc.org/congs/ut/ut005/">Temple
            Har Shalom</a> in Park City. "We certainly support
            circumcision as a rite of passage for male infants in
            the Jewish tradition. It's been going on for thousands
            of years and has a tremendous ritual and tremendous
            emotional significance."</p>

            <p>Shuaib Uddin, imam at the Khadeeja Islamic Center in
            West Valley City, said Muslims are unanimous about male
            circumcision being a requirement of their
            tradition.</p>

            <p>That said, some within those faiths, such as <a
            href="http://www.jewsagainstcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Jews Against Circumcision</a>, have
            spoken out against the practice.</p>

            <p>Religious issues aside, cultural preference for
            circumcision is strong.</p>

            <p>That's partly because few Americans understand what
            is lost when the foreskin is removed, said Steve Scott
            of Salt Lake City, a director of NOCIRC of Utah and
            expert on the issue.</p>

            <p>Circumcision removes skin that is loaded with
            sensory nerves, protective and sexual functions, Scott
            said. Like an eyelid, the foreskin keeps the penis
            moist and warm, provides immunological protection and
            acts as a rolling mechanism during sexual intercourse.
            The specialized skin is "all obliterated in
            circumcision," said Scott.</p>

            <p>An infant circumcision, which takes place days after
            birth in either a hospital or clinic, takes about 5
            minutes and costs $175 to $200. Parents typically are
            not present when the surgery is performed.</p>

            <p>Complications occur in 1 in 200 to 1 in 500
            circumcised newborn males, according to the American
            Academy of Pediatrics&mdash;most often bleeding and
            local infection.</p>

            <p>Occasionally, circumcisions go horribly wrong and
            the penis is damaged or excised. In rare cases, <a
            href="/library/death/">infants have died</a>.</p>

            <p>Some parents have sued after the procedure was
            performed on their sons, saying they gave consent while
            indisposed or weren't properly informed of the risks
            and benefits of circumcision.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a>, an attorney in Hawley,
            Minn., represented a client who made such allegations
            in a case against <a href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Hospital</a> in Fargo, N.D.
            The hospital was exonerated in February, but Baer, who
            considers circumcision "barbaric," has vowed to seek a
            retrial.</p>

            <p>In 1995, <a
            href="http://firms.findlaw.com//llewellynlaw/practices.htm"
            target="_blank">David J. Llewellyn</a>, an
            Atlanta-area attorney, won a $65,000 verdict in
            Montgomery County, Ala., on behalf of a child who was
            circumcised against his mother's wishes.</p>

            <p>Since then, Llewellyn has taken on about 17 wrongful
            circumcision or circumcision damage cases, most
            involving infants or young boys but also several men
            with diabetes who underwent circumcisions recommended
            by urologists&mdash;with horrendous results.</p>

            <p>"Parents are told virtually nothing except that it
            is cleaner and supposedly reduces the incidence of
            certain things," Llewellyn said.</p>

            <p>He believes there are three reasons parents continue
            to seek circumcision: They want their sons to look like
            Dad; it is a big business&mdash;he estimates it
            generates at least $250 million a year; and there is a
            cultural psychosexual phenomenon that promotes genital
            conformity.</p>

            <p>Once genital cutting becomes embedded in a society,
            "there is a deep-seated need to continue that
            conformity," Llewellyn said.</p>

            <p>"Can a doctor as a doctor put tribal marks on the
            face of a child to look like Mom and Dad?" he asks. "We
            assault the penis and for some reason, we assume that's
            all right."</p>

            <h3>A brief history of circumcision in the United
            States</h3>

            <p>In America, circumcision is "this coat rack we keep
            hanging myths on," according to Marilyn Milos, director
            of the National Organization of Circumcision
            Information Resource Centers.</p>

            <p>Justification for the surgery has ranged over time
            from a treatment for paralysis to not wanting to look
            different, Milos said. That evolution was outlined by
            medical historian David Gollahar in a <a
            href="/library/history/gollaher/">1994 article</a> in
            the Journal of Social History. Here is a look at
            circumcision over time:</p>

            <p>*1870s: A New York doctor uses circumcision to treat
            paralysis and mental disorders in young boys. Until
            now, circumcision was done for religious reasons or to
            treat cancer and an overly tight foreskin.</p>

            <p>1880s: Doctors advocate circumcision for infants,
            citing hygienic reasons as well as prevention of
            masturbation and venereal diseases.</p>

            <p>1890s: Germ theory and cancer fears boost
            circumcision acceptance. One doctor credits
            circumcision as a cure for alcoholism, epilepsy,
            hernias, headaches and a host of other conditions. A
            popular baby book advocates the procedure in most
            cases, particularly to prevent "the vile habit of
            masturbation."</p>

            <p>Early 1900s: Infant circumcision is becoming
            standard practice and is viewed as an indicator of rank
            and social order since only babies delivered by private
            physicians in hospitals receive the surgery.</p>

            <p>Mid-1900s: Fears of penile cancer continue to be
            used as reason for circumcision. It also is seen as
            helping to prevent cervical cancer in women.</p>

            <p>1960s: In the midst of the sexual revolution, the
            belief in circumcision's ability to prevent spread of
            sexually transmitted diseases resurfaces even as more
            people question common medical wisdom.</p>

            <p>1970s: Up to 90 percent of American baby boys are
            circumcised, even as leading medical groups&mdash;and
            baby guru Benjamin Spock&mdash;say there is no medical
            reason to continue routine practice of the procedure.
            Cultural acceptance outweighs medical knowledge.</p>

            <p>1980s: A flawed study gives circumcision new
            momentum when it indicates higher risk of urinary-tract
            infections in uncircumcised males.</p>

            <p>1990s: With the spread of HIV and AIDS, circumcision
            is touted as way to avoid the disease.</p>
