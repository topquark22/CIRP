            <h2>Circumcision protects men from AIDS but might
            increase risk to women, early results suggest</h2>

            <p>LONDON: Circumcision may reduce men's chances of
            contracting HIV by up to 60 percent &mdash; <span
            class="yellow">but early results suggest the procedure
            may put women at increased risk of infection</span>,
            according to preliminary data presented Tuesday.</p>

            <p>Early results announced at a U.N. consultation in
            Switzerland on the potential impact of male
            circumcision on AIDS in Africa suggested that if
            HIV-positive men do not abstain from sex while healing
            from circumcision surgery, their female partners might
            have a higher chance of catching HIV from them.</p>

            <p>However, experts said the results were not
            conclusive &mdash; and highly susceptible to other
            factors, such as condom use &mdash; demonstrating the
            difficulties of utilizing circumcision in HIV
            prevention in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 60
            percent of those with AIDS are women.</p>

            <p>Previous studies have confirmed the dramatic impact
            circumcision has in cutting men's HIV infection rates,
            but a big question has been the resulting effect on
            women.</p>

            <p>The first evidence &mdash; though very preliminary
            &mdash; suggests there is a period immediately
            following surgery when men may more easily transmit the
            virus to their female partners.</p>

            <p>Women are already so vulnerable in this epidemic,"
            said Jennifer Kates, an AIDS expert at the <a
            href="http://www.kff.org" target="_blank">Kaiser Family
            Foundation</a> who is not connected to the study. "We
            need to be particularly careful about anything that
            could put them at even greater risk."</p>

            <p>Researchers at the Rakai Health Sciences Program and
            <a href="http://www.mak.ac.ug/"
            target="_blank">Makerere University</a> in Uganda and
            the <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/"
            target="_blank">John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public
            Health</a> in the U.S. tracked 997 HIV-positive men in
            Uganda and their female partners.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Among 70 men with HIV who
            underwent circumcision, 11 of their female partners
            became infected with the virus in the month after the
            surgery. In contrast, only four partners of 54
            uncircumcised men with HIV in the control group caught
            the virus &mdash; nearly half the rate, early results
            showed.</span></p>

            <p>Researchers said the results suggest increased HIV
            transmission from men who have sex before they had
            properly healed.</p>

            <p>However, they said the numbers so far were too small
            to be statistically significant, and left open the
            possibility that the higher rates were due to chance;
            both groups of men and women were given repeated HIV
            prevention education and free condoms.</p>

            <p>Experts said the study showed the importance of
            finding ways to protect women in the search for ways to
            fight AIDS.</p>

            <p>"We need to err on the side of caution to protect
            women in any future male circumcision program," said
            Dr. Maria Wawer, the study's lead investigator, a
            researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public
            Health.</p>

            <p>More than 60 percent of AIDS patients in sub-Saharan
            Africa are women. The social and economic inequalities
            between men and women are thought to be responsible for
            the elevated rates of infection in women, with many
            women trapped in relationships with unfaithful men.</p>

            <p>The preliminary results do not call into question
            the utility of circumcision as a way to prevent AIDS in
            Africa.</p>

            <p>But "while male circumcision has extraordinary
            potential to prevent HIV infection, these new findings
            remind us that we must proceed with thought and care in
            developing strategies to expand male circumcision in
            Africa," said Dr. Kevin De Cock, director of <a
            href="http://www.who.int" target="_blank">WHO</a>'s
            AIDS department. "Circumcision is an additional
            prevention strategy rather than a replacement for
            anything else.</p>
