      <b>Circumcision used to be regarded as routine. But as debate
      rages over its benefits, the majority of new parents are now
      saying no thanks.</b> 

      <p><b>by Rosemarie Milsom</b></p>

      <p>When Debbie Huybers gave birth to baby Lachlan earlier
      this year, she planned to have him circumcised, just like his
      five-year-old brother Liam. "I've worked in the health system
      for years and I never forget seeing an elderly man with a
      serious infection. I decided then that if I ever had boys,
      I'd get them circumcised." Debbie and her husband, Brett,
      thought their request would be considered routine but nothing
      prepared the couple for the reaction of hospital staff. "I
      was treated like a barbarian. I just couldn't believe it,"
      says Debbie.</p>

      <p>The anxious mother was told the hospital had stopped
      circumcising newborns because demand for the service had
      declined. "There's a lot of politics behind it," says Debbie,
      still simmering about having to have her son circumcised
      privately five weeks after his birth (the procedure is
      usually carried out in the first few days of life). "I was
      really upset. I had a hell of a time trying to find a doctor
      who would do it. I believe that if there's a procedure there
      that can prevent an infection then use it."</p>

      <p>At its peak in the 1960s, neonatal circumcision was one of
      the most frequently performed surgical procedures in
      Australia. For generations, the operation was so commonplace
      it was regarded as simply a routine of childbirth -- like
      cutting a newborn's umbilical cord. But as the Huybers found,
      times have changed. Demand for the procedure has declined in
      recent years as its benefits continue to be hotly debated.
      According to the <a
      href="/library/statements/acp1996/">Australian College of
      Paediatrics</a>, less than 15% of boys are being circumcised
      nationally -- about 20,000 circumcisions were performed in
      1997-98.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.ama.com.au/">Australian Medical
      Association</a> (AMA) sees several reasons for the decline.
      "I think part of the reason is that when something went
      wrong, it gained a lot of publicity in an era when people
      were starting to question the procedure," says the
      Perth-based federal executive of the AMA, Dr Rosanna
      Capolingua.</p>

      <p>Parents choose circumcision for religious, cultural and
      social reasons. Many, like Debbie Huybers, are also
      influenced by the view that the procedure prevents urinary
      tract infections and penile cancers. But recent research
      suggests otherwise.</p>

      <p>The results of a United States study, which were issued in
      January, show the benefits of circumcision were not as
      significant as previously believed. The findings came from a
      review of more than 350,000 boys born in hospitals throughout
      Washington state from 1987 to 1996. Researchers found that
      for every complication from circumcision, only six urinary
      tract infections were prevented and for every two
      complications, only case of penile cancer was prevented.
      Complications include damage to the shaft and urethra,
      haemorrhage, infections, amputation and even death.</p>

      <p>"The benefits do not outweigh the risks," says Capolingua.
      "Good hygiene in an uncircumcised boy is effective in
      preventing infection. In only a few cases is it necessary to
      perform the surgery for medical reasons."</p>

      <p>As well as considering the risks of the procedure,
      barrister Neville Turner believes parents should give weight
      to the legal implications of their decision to proceed with
      the operation. "The whole concept of a child suing the doctor
      and parents later in life is a real possibility," says
      Turner. "Many people feel that it is the parents who have the
      rights but very few consider the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">rights of the child</a>
      who is being subjected to an irreversible procedure."</p>

      <p>In March, Turner joined three other legal and health
      professionals in calling for circumcision of baby boys to be
      outlawed. Writing in the <a
      href="/library/legal/boyle1/"><i>Journal of Law and
      Medicine</i></a>, they questioned whether parental consent to
      a routine circumcision had ever been truly informed. "The
      reality of the situation is that I think a lot of parents are
      never really confronted with the hard facts," says Turner.
      "It is an extremely painful process that can go horribly
      wrong."</p>

      <p>The conflicting reports of the pros and cons doesn't make
      the decision any easier for parents. Both Turner and
      Capolingua agree that parents should consider all the facts
      before consenting to the operation. "Be prepared to ask
      questions because there is a lot of misinformation out
      there," adds Turner.</p>

      <p>However, Debbie Huybers believes she made the right
      decision for her two sons. "I can see why people choose not
      to have it done and I'm not that narrow-minded to think
      everyone should do it," she says. "I've got nephews who
      aren't 'circed' and I respect my sister's decision. In the
      end, you've got to do what you're comfortable with."</p>

      <p><b>Letter in <i>Sunday Life!</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;30 July,
      2000</b></p>

      <p><i>Sunday Life!</i> reported the case of a woman who
      against medical advice had her healthy child subjected to
      amputative surgery. (23/7)</p>

      <p>In any other instance, this woman would have been brought
      up on charges, but because the procedure was called
      circumcision, she had the opportunity to report her opinions
      and justifications in <i>Sunday Life!</i></p>

      <p>Circumcision is the only operation in which parents assume
      the role of doctor and make a medical decision about surgery.
      Often, as in the case of Debbie Huybers, going against
      accepted medical practice.</p>

      <p>Ms Huybers' justification for her son's genital reduction
      surgery was that she once saw an elderly man with 'a serious
      infection' in hospital. Infections can be cured with
      antibiotics. What kind of logic is it to subject a healthy
      person to surgery because someone else once had an
      infection?</p>

      <p>Medicine is a science and should therefore be ruled by
      empirical evidence -- not the whims of parents.</p>
