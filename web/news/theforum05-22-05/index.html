            <h2>Influenced by infant's cries, man wants ban on
            circumcision</h2>
            By JAMES WARDEN Associated Press Writer 

            <p>BISMARCK, N.D.</p>

            <p>Mervin Gajewski remembers hearing an infant's wails
            while he was having blood tests done in a Watford City
            hospital a few years ago.</p>

            <p>"Somebody better help that baby. He sounds hurt,"
            the 78-year-old Alexander man says he told a nurse.
            "You would be, too, if you were being circumcised," she
            replied.</p>

            <p>When a friend's daughter chose to circumcise her son
            last year, Gajewski decided to sue, in an attempt to
            get North Dakota courts to ban circumcision. A judge
            dismissed Gajewski's case last week, but he said he
            intends to continue, perhaps with an appeal to the <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/"
            target="_blank">North Dakota Supreme Court</a>.</p>

            <p>"I don't intend to be done with this case one way or
            another," he said.</p>

            <p>Circumcision involves the removal of sensitive
            foreskin from the penis. The procedure is usually done
            on infants.</p>

            <p>Nationally, about 56 percent of male infants are
            circumcised, according to a 2003 survey compiled by the
            federal <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/"
            target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and
            Prevention</a>. The Midwestern region, which includes
            North Dakota, had a 78 percent circumcision rate, which
            is the highest in the country, said CDC spokesman Bill
            Crews.</p>

            <p>In a March 1999 <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/"
            target="_blank">policy statement</a>, the American
            Academy of Pediatrics said there are "potential medical
            benefits" to circumcision, including a lessening of the
            risk of getting urinary tract infections. However,
            existing data "are not sufficient to recommend routine
            ... circumcision" of newborns, the statement says.</p>

            <p>Gajewski says the reasons justifying the procedure
            are speculative, using the assumption that "somewhere
            down the line, it's going to be good for you."</p>

            <p>"Surgery isn't done that way," he said.</p>

            <p>Gajewski believes male circumcision is tantamount to
            genital mutilation. The Legislature made female genital
            mutilation a felony crime in 1995. Gajewski's lawsuit
            argued that courts should extend the ban to boys.</p>

            <p>Northwest District <a
            href="http://www.ndcourts.com/court/bios/rustad.htm"
            target="_blank">Judge Gerald Rustad</a> dismissed the
            case last week, saying Gajewski had no standing to
            bring the case. Gajewski was suing on behalf of North
            Dakota boys younger than 18, but he is 78 years old,
            and does not represent any young boys, the judge
            said.</p>

            <p>"Although the topic is one which could result in
            interesting information and analysis in the proper
            forum, this court has not been presented any precedent
            which would persuade it that (Gajewski) has standing to
            bring the action," Rustad wrote in his dismissal
            order.</p>

            <p>North Dakota's state and federal courts have taken
            up the issue previously.</p>

            <p>Last September, the <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/"
            target="_blank">North Dakota Supreme Court</a> ruled in
            favor of a Fargo doctor who had circumcised an infant
            in March 1997. The boy's mother argued she was not told
            in detail about the procedure's benefits and potential
            risks.</p>

            <p>The woman, Anita Flatt of Hawley, Minn., also had
            argued that North Dakota's law barring female genital
            mutilation did not offer equal protection to males. The
            Supreme Court said Flatt did not have standing to make
            that argument.</p>

            <p>In June 1996, a Bismarck woman, Donna Fishbeck, made
            similar equal-protection arguments in a federal lawsuit
            against the state. Fishbeck's infant son had been
            circumcised with the consent of the boy's father, even
            though she objected to the procedure.</p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge Patrick Conmy dismissed the
            case, ruling that Fishbeck did not have legal standing
            to bring the lawsuit. A three-judge panel of the <a
            href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/index.html"
            target="_blank">8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</a>
            upheld Conmy's ruling in June 1997.</p>

            <p>"Even if we were to declare the North Dakota statute
            invalid because it is underinclusive, and even if ...
            we could enter some kind of decree that would
            criminalize male circumcision, there is no assurance at
            all that the injury claimed by Fishbeck, either on her
            own behalf of on behalf of her son, would be
            redressed," the appeals court's decision says.</p>

            <p>Circumcision opponents say the foreskin protects the
            penis and can enhance <a href="/library/sex_function/"
            target="_blank">sexual pleasure</a>. Gajewski, who is
            not circumcised, said those benefits are being taken
            away without reason.</p>

            <p>"It's unnecessary and detrimental to a male," he
            said. "You destroy too much potential."</p>
