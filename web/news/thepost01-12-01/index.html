      <h2>More men are trying to get back what the surgeon once
      removed</h2>
      <i>Jan. 12, 2001</i> | <i>4:26 p.m.</i> 

      <p>Greg Beirise of Chicago has never quite forgiven doctors
      for circumcising him 32 years ago, nor his parents for
      requesting the procedure.</p>

      <p>``It always bothered me,'' said Beirise, a Web page
      developer. ``I just wanted to be whole.''</p>

      <p>Beirise is one of what many estimate are several thousands
      of men in the United States and other countries who are
      taking back what doctors cut away at their birth.</p>

      <p>Brought together mainly over the Internet, these men are
      young, retired, straight, gay, blue collar and professional
      and say they are growing back their foreskin, transforming
      themselves from circumcised to near natural in a few years
      for better sex, general comfort and emotional
      ``healing.''</p>

      <p>Beirise has worn a pair of men's tall-size suspenders
      under his pants for the past four and a half years. The
      suspenders are attached to various devices -- from first-aid
      tape to a contraption made of halved plastic Easter eggs and
      copper wire -- that gently stretch the skin on his penis.</p>

      <p>His goal: to grow back skin that resembles the foreskin he
      lost when he was circumcised.</p>

      <p>Doctors say men like Beirise, who call themselves
      ``tuggers,'' won't likely do himself any harm. Dr. William
      Reiner, a psychiatrist and urologist at <a
      href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/medicalschool/"
      target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University School of
      Medicine</a>, said trying to regrow foreskin is safe, so long
      as men avoid cutting off their blood supply, piercing their
      skin or causing themselves any pain.</p>

      <p>Experts say that the extent to which the skin grows back
      depends upon how much was cut away in the first place. They
      also say the new skin may not have the same sensitivity as
      the original would have.</p>

      <p>But Reiner says that may not matter to some.</p>

      <p>He says men who try to regrow their foreskin may be trying
      to restore ``some sense of sexual function or maleness they
      think they've lost.''</p>

      <p>``And some are (trying to) restore something that was done
      to them when they were a baby and didn't have any say,''
      Reiner said.</p>

      <p>``These issues are more psychological than physical, and
      there's probably some placebo effect that's very helpful to
      them,'' he said.</p>

      <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics in 1999 reversed its
      support for <a href="/library/statements/aap1999/">routine
      infant circumcision</a>, citing questionable benefits and
      medical and anecdotal evidence that circumcised men have less
      penile sensitivity.</p>

      <p>It was a move welcomed by R. Wayne Griffiths of Concord,
      Calif. The construction engineer and friend Tim Hammond put
      ads in local newspapers more than a decade ago inviting men
      to a support group for those hoping to restore their
      foreskins. The first meeting attracted 12 men, Griffiths
      said. And the response grew from there.</p>

      <p>``We got 25 calls a week for the first few months,'' said
      Griffiths, a 67-year-old divorced father of five. Not bad for
      a subject most men were afraid to mention, he said.</p>

      <p>Today, Griffiths says as many as 7,000 men of all
      descriptions have contacted him online or on the telephone
      about restoration. He now heads the National Organization for
      Restoring Men, or NORM, a group that has chapters in 20
      states and six countries.</p>

      <p>``It used to be hush-hush,'' said Leo Freyer, a retired
      engineering drafter in Spokane, Wash. ``Now it's
      mainstream.''</p>

      <p>Those interested now buy books written on the topic -- the
      most popular of which, <a href="/pages/reviews/bigelow/">The
      Joy of Uncircumcising</a>, has gone through two editions and
      is on backorder at Amazon.com. Some 13,000 copies have been
      sold so far.</p>

      <p>Guided by online instructions, many men make
      ``uncircumcising'' devices themselves, using adhesive-backed
      foam rubber, plumbing washers, empty pill bottles and rubber
      O-rings, among other things.</p>

      <p>They also buy equipment designed for the purpose,
      including the $100 <a href="http://www.tugahoy.com/"
      target="_blank">Tug Ahoy</a>, which includes plastic Easter
      egg halves, and the wares of retired motorcycle dealer Roland
      Clark of Huntington Beach, Calif., who sells <a
      href="http://www.abody.com/" target="_blank">three patented
      products</a> online for as much as $450.</p>

      <p>Above all, men interested in the subject are computer
      savvy. One 3-year-old <a
      href="http://www.eskimo.com/%7egburlin/restore/rest.html"
      target="_blank">online discussion group on restoration</a>
      has 400 to 650 members at any given time based in the U.S.
      and 16 other countries, said its moderator, Gary Burlingame.
      And Freyer, who edits an online directory, counts 69 Web
      sites and four chat rooms devoted to the topic, most of which
      he said have appeared within the past couple of years.</p>

      <p>They trade ideas and support because doctors often want no
      part of it, said Dr. Morrie Sorrells, a retired pediatrician
      in Atherton, Calif., who is on the board of NORM and who
      practices uncircumcising techniques himself.</p>

      <p>``The medical profession is conservative and tends to look
      askance at anything that is lay-oriented, or not originated
      by medicine,'' Sorrells, 62, said.</p>

      <p>Reiner, the Johns Hopkins psychiatrist, agrees that
      physicians, for the most part, are not usually comfortable
      discussing sexual issues with their patients and tend to
      steer clear of such topics. For that reason, he said,
      foreskin restoration remains very much a quiet topic.</p>

      <p>Though they are talkative with each other, many of those
      individuals -- no matter how mainstream they believe the
      practice is becoming -- say they're not likely to mention
      their activities in polite company anytime soon.</p>

      <p>They say many people don't understand why they do it.</p>

      <p>``Knowledge is the key,'' Freyer said. ``They just don't
      know what they're missing.''</p>
