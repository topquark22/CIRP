      <h2>Betrayed by Doctors and Lawyers in Alaska,<br />
      Sweets Find Justice Through Seattle Malpractice Attorney</h2>

      <p>SEATTLE, March 8 <i>PRNewswire</i> -- Johnson Flora today
      issued the following statement:</p>

      <p>When Jacob Sweet was born at <a
      href="http://www.providence.org/alaska/facilities/pamc.htm"
      target="_blank">Providence Hospital</a> in Anchorage, Alaska
      in January 1986, it was a dream come true for his parents,
      Beverly and Gary. But their dream took a nightmarish turn
      only nine days later when they took their son back to the
      hospital for treatment of an infected circumcision and the
      hospital returned a severely brain-damaged and blind child.
      The nightmare continued for 13 years and included ``lost''
      medical records and an Alaska lawyer who claimed to be an
      experienced medical malpractice attorney, but who had never
      tried a malpractice case. This is the story behind a major
      legal malpractice settlement announced today between a
      Bothell, Wash., family and the Alaska law firm that handled
      the Sweet's medical malpractice lawsuit against Providence
      Hospital of Anchorage and the pediatrician who treated Jacob
      for the infection.</p>

      <p>The settlement ends a 13-year battle for the Sweets who
      were forced to fight for their son in the court system on two
      occasions. First, they sought justice from the hospital and
      doctor who allegedly caused Jacob's injuries, and who then
      ``lost'' the medical records critical to proving Jacob's
      case. Then, after Alaska lawyer Alan Sherry mishandled the
      Sweets' medical malpractice case, they were forced to once
      again resort to the courts to get justice for Jacob.</p>

      <p>Seattle attorney Mark Johnson represented the Sweets in
      the legal malpractice suit, arguing the Sweet's first
      attorney misrepresented himself as a seasoned malpractice
      lawyer and then failed to properly try the Sweets' medical
      negligence case. The Sweets had hired Sherry to sue
      Providence Hospital of Anchorage for negligent care of Jacob
      during his hospital stay.</p>

      <p>The amount awarded to the Sweets is confidential as part
      of the settlement agreement.</p>

      <p>``This has been tragedy at every turn for this family,''
      Johnson said. ``First the healthcare system devastated their
      child. Then, when the Sweets most needed an aggressive,
      experienced and competent lawyer, an attorney with no
      malpractice experience misled them and failed to properly try
      the case. That cost them their opportunity to recover damages
      from the hospital and the pediatrician,'' he added.</p>

      <p><b>The Underlying Medical Malpractice Case</b></p>

      <p>The Sweet's tragedy started on January 25, 1986, in
      Anchorage, Alaska, when they brought their nine-day-old son
      Jacob back to <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.providence.org/alaska/facilities/pamc.htm">Providence
      Hospital</a> after he exhibited signs of an infected
      circumcision. Jacob was admitted to the pediatric ward and
      displayed seizure activity for 24 hours, but their
      pediatrician, Dr. Daniel Tulip, was absent most of the time
      and failed to refer Jacob to a neonatologist until after
      Jacob had suffered the brain damage that would leave him
      physically devastated, developmentally delayed, and utterly
      dependent for the rest of his life.</p>

      <p><b>Injustice Served Twice</b></p>

      <p>The Sweet's calamity compounded when the Alaska law firm
      they hired to try their medical malpractice suit improperly
      handled the case. According to Johnson, the lawsuit hinged on
      the fact that Jacob's medical records disappeared shortly
      after this tragic episode in the hospital, suggesting that
      someone was trying to cover up a negligent act. Sweet's first
      legal team failed to present this evidence properly, although
      they had key witnesses prepared to present the opinion that
      the records must have been intentionally destroyed, claims
      Johnson. The Sweets lost the suit, and with it all hope of
      recovering damages from the hospital that would cover the
      costs of lifelong care for Jacob's severe injuries.</p>

      <p>Racked with guilt and with mounting medical bills, the
      Sweets hired Mark Johnson to represent them in an action for
      legal negligence, because of his dual experience in medical
      and legal malpractice cases.</p>

      <p>``To me the Sweets are heroic figures,'' Johnson said.
      ``In order to right a terrible wrong -- the catastrophic
      injury to their son -- they confronted two of society's most
      powerful institutions: the medical system and the legal
      system. They fought for 13 years until they prevailed.''</p>

      <p>Legal malpractice cases are difficult to prove, because
      the plaintiff must not only prove the defendant attorney was
      negligent, but that the client would have won the case if the
      attorney had acted differently, according to the
      International Association of Defense Counsel.</p>

      <p>``This brings some peace-of-mind to our lives, although we
      are still convinced that Jacob's doctor and the hospital have
      never told the truth,'' said Beverly Sweet. ``At least now we
      can provide for Jacob's medical care and future.''</p>

      medical malpractice firm in Seattle. Johnson has significant
      experience in representing children and families who have

      injuries and is listed in the book ``The Best Lawyers In
