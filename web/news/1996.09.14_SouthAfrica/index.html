        <h2>Botched circumcisions lead to arrest for murder</h2>

        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Police in South Africa have arrested a traditional
        "surgeon" and charged him with murder after the deaths of
        four Xhosa initiates in Lusikisi, a small village in the
        Eastern Cape province last month. More than 60 others were
        admitted to hospital with septic wounds after the botched
        circumcisions. Around 26 of the young men, aged about 18
        years, had plastic and reconstructive surgery on their
        penises by teams of doctors flown into the region. The
        project was funded by the <a
        href="http://www.redcross.org.za/">South African Red
        Cross</a>. The young men will be given psychological
        help.</p>

        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        disaster has led to a debate among the country's health
        experts, lawmakers, and guardians of local traditions. The
        <a href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/">Eastern Cape's
        government</a> has appointed a team to look into the ritual
        and propose legislation to deal with the problem. In the
        same region last year there were 34 deaths, 12 penis
        mutilations, and 743 initiates admitted to hospital for
        septic wounds.</p>

        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Until this year's disaster there had been a move towards
        using Western medical and more hygienic methods for the
        practice, including the use of scalpels instead of assegais
        (spears). Some local hospitals have started a programme to
        examine the young men before they enter the initiation
        schools, and a code of conduct was agreed in 1991 on how to
        carry out the rites. At the end of that year there had been
        no casualties among those who had passed through the more
        sterile hands of the "surgeons" who had adhered to the
        code.</p>

        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        These moves have not found favour with all local chiefs,
        and at least one group has rejected the Westernisation of
        the circumcision schools. The debate extended into a
        censorship row, too, when King Mayisha II of the Ndzundza
        Mabhoko tribe complained to the <a
        href="http://www.bccsa.co.za/">Broadcasting Complaints
        Commission of South Africa</a> about the handling of
        circumcision by the state run South African Broadcasting
        Corporation. After an incident in which 50 men had a
        botched circumcision the broadcasting corporation stated
        that of 10 callers to a programme on the issue most were in
        favour of maintaining the practice of circumcision but
        called for qualified medical practitioners to investigate
        health standards at the initiation schools to minimise
        deaths and mutilations. The king complained that gross
        damage was being done to a culture that was the pride of
        the nation. His complaint was not upheld.</p>
