            <p class="text">ARUSHA, 28 Mar 2003 (IRIN) - Elements
            of traditional culture and subservient female roles in
            Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania are pushing HIV/AIDS
            infection rates up to unprecedented levels, experts
            said this week.</p>

            <p class="text">In Tanzania, as is generally the case
            for sub-Saharan Africa, there are about 1.5 women for
            every male victim of HIV/AIDS, Leoni Msimbe, a director
            from Tanzania's <a
            href="http://www.tanzania.go.tz/indexE.html"
            target="_blank">Ministry of Community Development,
            Gender and Children in Tanzania</a>, told a workshop in
            Arusha, Tanzania.</p>

            <p class="text">While this proportion may be somewhat
            exaggerated by the fact that more data is available on
            women due to routine antenatal tests, it is widely
            accepted that women and young girls are increasingly
            vulnerable to infection.</p>

            <p class="text"><span>Hilde Basstanie of <a
            href="http://www.unaids.org/"
            target="_blank">UNAIDS</a> said that girls between 15
            and 19 in the region were now six times more likely to
            be HIV-positive than boys in the same age bracket,
            often as a result of rape, coercion or sex with older
            men.</span></p>

            <p class="text">While biology plays a significant role
            in the high rates of transmission (females are twice as
            likely as males to be infected during unprotected sex),
            man-made socio-political factors are adding plenty of
            fuel to the fire.</p>

            <p class="text"><b>UNEQUAL STATUS</b></p>

            <p class="text">Patriarchal culture in the region has
            heavily influenced the legal systems, governance
            structures and value systems that uphold the unequal
            status of girls and women.</p>

            <p class="text">A number of commonly observed
            traditional practices are now recognised as being
            directly responsible for the spread of HIV/AIDS. Widow
            inheritance, widow "cleansing", wife sharing, wife
            exchanging with land or cattle, and polygamy are some
            of the key ones, which are stacked against women's
            health because the parties involved do not test for
            HIV.</p>

            <p class="text"><span>Female and male circumcision are
            still practised in the traditional way, using the same
            knives or blades. In the case of females, circumcision
            can also lead to bleeding during sex.</span></p>

            <p class="text">Aside from these traditional practices
            are the social norms which dictate that females defer
            to males. "Male youth have been cultured to believe it
            is a sign of manhood to be able to control
            relationships. Females are brought up to believe that
            males are superior in all spheres of life and should be
            the masters of sexual relationships," said Ambrose
            Rachier of the Kenya Ethical and Legal Network.</p>

            <p class="text">"The rigid implementation of
            traditional practices such as dowry payments make women
            men's property," he noted.</p>

            <p class="text"><b>SEXUAL SUBSERVIENCE</b></p>

            <p class="text">While men are encouraged to be
            promiscuous - including within marriage - women are
            often expected to remain "pure". Furthermore, low
            levels of education among girls and women, due to being
            pulled out of school early to perform household duties
            or care for sick relatives, mean they cannot access HIV
            information.</p>

            <p class="text">"Young women are kept ignorant about
            sex - this is viewed as a sign of innocence," said Dr
            Patrick Orege, Deputy Director of the National AIDS
            Control Council (NACC) in Kenya.</p>

            <p class="text">This in turn makes them totally
            unprepared for sexual relations, and equally unable to
            negotiate for safe sex.</p>

            <p class="text">"Women are at risk because of a lack of
            power to determine when, where and whether sex takes
            place," added Paul Bukuluki of <a
            href="http://www.unesco.org/"
            target="_blank">UNESCO</a>.</p>

            <p class="text">There is growing evidence that a large
            number of new cases of infection is due to violence in
            homes, schools, the workplace and other social centres,
            such as churches or while collecting water.</p>

            <p class="text"><b>USE OF CONDOMS</b></p>

            <p class="text">Female condoms have been found to be
            inappropriate and inadequate in the context and culture
            of East Africa, and have been largely unsuccessful in
            providing protection for women.</p>

            <p class="text">The Ugandan Ministry of Health
            purchased 1.2 million female condoms but found that
            women were not familiar enough with their anatomies to
            use them, said Vashta Kibirige of the Ugandan <a
            href="http://www.health.go.ug/"
            target="_blank">Ministry of Health</a>. "Culturally,
            women are brought up not to touch any of their private
            parts."</p>

            <p class="text">The condoms were also beyond the reach
            of most women, costing up to 10 times as much as the
            male condom.</p>

            <p class="text">Aside from both men and women's
            reluctance to wear condoms within the context of
            marriage, in cultures where the value of women is
            dependent on their ability to reproduce, they are
            compelled to have unprotected sex, placing themselves
            and their babies at risk.</p>

            <p class="text">Up to 80 percent of infections among
            women occurred in "stable relationships" where the man
            had become infected elsewhere, Orege of the Kenyan
            National AIDS Control Council pointed out.</p>

            <p class="text">Indeed, one of the key findings of the
            Arusha workshop was that sex workers were often better
            able to protect themselves than housewives because they
            were more empowered to insist on safe sex.</p>

            <p class="text"><b>POVERTY AND STIGMA</b></p>

            <p class="text">Widespread poverty and unemployment
            compound the status quo by forcing women and girls to
            engage in risky sex with all sort of people, including
            their partners and husbands.</p>

            <p class="text">Most women who are HIV positive are
            poor and are rejected by their husbands and families,
            and therefore cannot afford medicine. In some cases
            women are forced to take HIV tests by their husbands or
            families, sometimes without their knowledge, and are
            then rejected.</p>

            <p class="text">Flavia Kyomukama of Uganda's <a
            href="http://www.wougnet.org/Profiles/nacwola.html"
            target="_blank">National Community of Women Living with
            HIV/AIDS</a> said her husband had rejected her after 12
            years of marriage, and forcibly separated her from her
            children.</p>

            <p class="text">"My case was assigned to a lady at the
            Human Rights Commission in Kampala. She, without my
            consent, closed my file because she was under pressure
            from my husband's friends to save my husband's dignity
            and job."</p>

            <p class="text">"My husband took all our savings and
            investments," she added. Inadequate and corrupt legal
            systems in the region, and a lack of political will to
            "interfere" in family matters mean that women often
            lose everything they own.</p>

            <p class="text">"HIV and poverty are mutually
            reinforcing - HIV pushes people into poverty," said
            Uganda's Minister of Gender, Labour and Social
            Development, Zoe Bakoko-Bakoru. Similarly, poverty
            places people at the mercy of HIV by forcing them to
            take risks.</p>

            <p class="text"><b>WAY FORWARD</b></p>

            <p class="text">While Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda all
            have national frameworks to deal with HIV/AIDS, there
            is a consensus that more needs to be done to prioritise
            women's issues. "My gut feeling is that we haven't done
            enough when it comes to implementing gender balance,"
            said Herman Lupogo of Tanzania's Commission for
            AIDS.</p>

            <p class="text">Bills that are drafted tend not to
            adequately address women's issues - such as the Kenya
            National Strategy on HIV/AIDS - which have to be added
            later on as an "afterthought".</p>

            <p class="text">Experts say more needs to be done to
            protect women's rights by legalising the sex industry,
            criminalising marital rape and wilful infection, and
            imposing heavier penalties on rapists. In addition,
            laws protecting human rights need to be harmonised to
            ensure basic protection.</p>

            <p class="text">In Kenya - in the field of family and
            land laws - Islamic law, Hindu law, customary and
            statutory laws were "all working against each other,"
            Rachier told IRIN.</p>

            <p class="text">Yet, the political will for change is
            lacking. Bills that might improve women's lot are not
            being passed or even debated because a male dominated
            parliament simply wouldn't accept them, Rachier said.
            In the areas of polygamy, FGM, wife inheritance and
            wife sharing, which are "widespread and deeply rooted",
            he said it was not possible to introduce legislation in
            Kenya.</p>

            <p class="text">"A sizeable proportion of the Kenyan
            population is poligamously married. We therefore did
            not think it prudent to declare such unions either in
            the present or in the future illegal," he said.</p>

            <p class="text"><b>COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT</b></p>

            <p class="text">This week, the three countries'
            National AIDS Councils/Commissions, UN agencies, NGOs
            and people living with HIV/AIDS issued a statement
            saying that "the centrality of culture" must be
            addressed more rigorously in each of the countries,
            recognising that culture "needs to transform" if the
            pandemic is to be halted. They also agreed to
            strengthen gender and HIV/AIDS policies and to share
            best practices between the three countries.</p>

            <p class="text">The consensus is that community-based
            education, which includes cultural and traditional
            leaders, is the only means to secure behavioural
            change. But with so many different communities and
            languages in each of the countries, initiatives needs
            to be tailor-made to each area.</p>

            <p class="text">Therein lies the challenge, which
            without adequate resources is impossible to achieve.
            Meanwhile, and for as long as the status quo remains,
            more and more women and girls will continue to lose
            their lives.</p>
