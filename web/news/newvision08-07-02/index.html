            <h2>Bagisu Circumcise Man, 30, in Public</h2>

            <p>Residents of Wabigalo, a suburb of Kampala, found an
            uncircumcised Mugisu man over 30 years of age.
            According to the eye witnesses, Wandeba had told people
            that he was a circumcised man, but his girlfriend, whom
            he had refused to pay for her goods, revealed this to
            the Bagisu.</p>

            <p>The angry mob immediately started looking for
            Wandeba, whom they found in a nearby restaurant
            drinking beer. When the mob demanded the truth, Wandeba
            immediately pounced on one, forcing the angry mob to
            undress him.</p>

            <p>According to an eye witness, Wandeba had tied his
            penis with a rubber band and his foreskin and the penis
            looked like a circumcised one. The angry mob quickly
            started singing Kadodi until they circumcised him
            infront of many onlookers. The mob immediately
            mobilised for money and gave him some while the rest
            was given to his girlfriend.</p>
