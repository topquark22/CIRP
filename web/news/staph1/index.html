    <h2>Staphylococcus Rash in Babies Linked to Health Care
    Workers</h2>

    <p>2000 APR 4 - (NewsRx.com) --</p>

    <p>An outbreak of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> pustulous rash
    in a group of newborn, circumcised babies has been linked to
    medical workers in the neonatal nursery.</p>

    <p>The outbreak occurred in the newborn nursery of a 150-bed
    naval hospital in eastern North Carolina and lasted from August
    to January of 1999.</p>

    <p>"Cases were newborn males who had undergone a circumcision
    procedure and post-discharge required anitmicrobial treatment
    for severe postulous diaper rash," reported K.K. Hoffmann and
    colleagues. Seventeen cases out of 36 total were cultured, and
    all 17 showed methicillin-sensitive, erythromycin-resistant S.
    aureus.</p>

    <p>Researchers could not find an inanimate reservoir for the S.
    aureus, but they did find initial control measures, including
    aseptic technique and instrument sterilization procedures, were
    not effective. Regulations were amended to include mandatory
    glove wearing for diaper changes and they limited the number of
    health care workers involved in post-circumcision care to
    one.</p>

    <p>Anterior nasal swabs were used to culture all the medical
    personnel; 14 showed S. aureus positive cultures. "Pulse field
    gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed on 13 of the 17 case
    isolates. All 13 case isolates were identical. All 14 HCWs
    [health care workers] identified with S. aureus were compared
    to the &gt;13 cases by PFGE, and three HCWs matched
    identically," reported researchers.</p>

    <p>They also found one of the three identically matched HCWs
    had a chronic cough and another had concealed dermatitis.</p>

    <p>"This suggests that these HCWs were disseminators in light
    of the prolonged nature of the outbreak," said Hoffmann et al.
    "Antimicrobial decolonization was instituted for the HCWs and
    there was one additional case in March. In conclusion, HCWs
    identified by DNA testing may have represented the reservoir of
    infection in this outbreak."</p>

    <p>The findings were presented at the 4th Decennial
    International Conference on Nosocomial and
    Healthcare-Associated Infections, held in Atlanta, Georgia. The
    study was titled, "Neonatal Staphylococcus aureus Pustulous
    Rash Outbreak Linked by Molecular Typing to Colonized
    Healthcare Workers."</p>
