<p><font face="arial" size="6">Doctor Testifies Surgeon Secretly
Circumcised Woman</font></p>

<p><b>By Christopher Baughman</b><br>
Advocate Staff Writer</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A doctor who assisted in
the circumcision of a woman 24 years ago said in court Tuesday that
he tried to stop the doctor in charge from performing the
procedure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doctor Karl Pizzolato
testified he thought Mary Ann Turner was just having routine female
surgery in 1972 after giving birth to her third child.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner's lawyer, Richard
Ducote, asked Pizzolato how he reacted when he found out the late
Dr. Anthony Leggio also intended to remove the skin covering
Turner's clitoris.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was shocked and
expressed deep concern that this shouldn't be done," said
Pizzolato, who was called as a witness by the plaintiff.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner is sueing her former
husband, local anesthesiologist Dr. Alan J. Ostowe, saying he
conspired with Leggio without her consent to perform the procedure
at <a href="http://www.womans.com/">Woman's Hospital</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She claims Ostrowe wanted
the operation done to heighten his own sexual pleasure, as well as
hers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The civil trial being heard
by a jury of eight women and four men, resumes today before state
District Judge Bob Downing. Turner asserts she did not know about
the circumcision until Pizzolato, a family friend, told her about
it in 1988.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However Ostrowe contends
Turner consented to the surgery. She didn't object to it until
1988, when Ostowe threatened to cut off her alimony stemming from
their 1983 divorce and the two fought over custody of one of their
four children, he claims.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defense lawyer Karl Koch
told the jury that Turner's claim is "nonsense."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither Leggio nor Ostrowe,
who were in the operating room but did not anaesthetize Turner,
were tryinng to keep anything secret, Koch said during opening
statements Tuesday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Koch said Leggio noted the
removal of the clitoral hood on all the hospital papers dealing
with the surgery. Many people in the hospital reviewed those
documents, he said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Leggio talked about the
procedure in a crowded operating room in front of other doctors and
nurses, Koch said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Koch questioned why Leggio
would risk his practice and reputation to perform a procedure on a
woman without her consent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To accept this thing,
you're going to have to suspend your good common sense." Koch said
in his opening remarks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Ducote called the
hospital's Consent for Treatment form "the smoking gun of the
case."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ostrowe signed the form for
his wife, Ducote said in his opening statement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a totally bogus
consent to conceal what they were going to do," he said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other hospital documents
recording the surgery were not filed until two months after the
operation, Ducote said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pizzolato and two other
doctors who treated Turner all said female circumcision was an
uncommon practice 24 years ago and still is today.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'd never heard about
anyone having one until this case." Dr. Robert DiBenedetto said
under questioning by Ducote.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But DiBenedetto - called to
testify by Ducote - said his records do not show that Turner
complained of increased sensitivity or numbness of her clitoris, as
her petition claims.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And DiBenedetto who treated
Turner from 1973 until he retired two years ago, testified he
examined Turner and could not find any sign of the
circumcision.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ducote said after court
adjourned that DiBenedetto's failure to find evidence of the
circumcision did not hurt his clients case.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what else he
missed if nobody disputes the surgery was done," he said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner's suit also claims
Ostrowe kept her under heavy sedation during her eight-day hospital
stay.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pizzolato said he visited
Turner in the hospital after the surgery, and she seemed heavily
sedated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also she was wearing a thin
negligee and risked being seen by anyone who entered her room. " I
thought that was out of character for her with doctors making
rounds," he said. "This is not Mary Ann, She's a lot more modest
than that."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Pizzolato said he saw
Ostowe give Turner two shots containing 10 milligrams of Valium,
which he called a heavy dose for a woman Turner's size.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Pizzolato said he
remained friends with Ostrowe after that. He even had Ostowe
administer anesthesia to his wife in 1975, two years after he tried
to stop Turner's circumcision.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You were comfortable with
Dr. Ostrowe doing that?" Koch asked Pizzolato.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, sir," Pizzolato
replied.</p>

<h3>THE ADVOCATE, Baton Rouge, La., Thursday, October 31,
1996.</h3>

<b>by Christopher Baughman.</b> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A woman who claims her
former husband conspired with another doctor 24 years ago to
circumcise her without her consent called the procedure "surgical
rape".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary Ann Turner said
Wednesday that she is sueing her former husband, local
anethesiologist Dr. Alan J. Ostrowe, so women can stand up against
all forms of rape.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's what is is,
surgical rape, when my body parts were cut off and thrown away,"
Turner said after her civil trial adjourned Wednesday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it had been done on a
back street or an alley, he'd be in jail. But because it was done
in an operating room, I'm supposed to be grateful?"</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner claims Ostrowe
conspired with the late Dr. Anthony Leggio to remove the skin
covering her clitoris during other routine surgery at Woman's
Hospital in 1972.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner says she did not
find out about the procedure until 1988, when another physician who
was at the operation told her about it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ostrowe contends his wife
agreed to the operation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He says she filed suit only
after he threatend to cut off alimony payments. The two divorced in
1983.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The charges lodged against
him by his former wife have sullied his reputation, Ostrowe said
after court adjourned Wednesday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The damage to be has been
done, and as far as I'm concerned, my name has been mushed in mud,"
Ostrowe said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial resumes today in
District Judge Bob Downing's courtroom.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During testimony Wednesday,
a doctor from Cincinatti called female circumcision
"mutilation."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Bradley Busacco said he
has treated 150 women who underwent the procedure without their
consent, all of them at the hands of a discredited doctor in
Dayton, Ohio.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. James Burt, who lost
his medical license, practiced the procedure between 1972 and the
late 1980s on 2000 women, supposedly to enhance their sexual
pleasure, Busacco said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And except for articles
Burt wrote for some Scandanavian journals, Busacco said he could
not find any literature in American journals recommending the
procedureto enhance sexual pleasure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How would you characterize
this type of surgery?" Turner's lawyer Richard Ducote, asked
Busacco.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This has been
characterized as a female mutilation surgery," Busacco said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later with the jury out of
the courtroom, defense lawyer, Karl Koch suggested to Downing that
he might need to declare a mistrial.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bussacco's testimony about
Burt's procedure went beyond what the two sides agreed to before
the trial started, Koch argued.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Koch said the trial is
sensational enough without bringing in the travails of Burt's 2,000
patients.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Koch said the judge ruled
before the trial that Burt's procedures had nothing to do with the
case.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Ducote argued that
Burt's work is the only literature on record.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dr. Burt is the body of
medical history regarding this illicit surgery," Ducote said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downing agreed with Koch
and warned Ducote against sensationalizing the case," saying It's
not a National Enquirer trial."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before that, Busacco
testified that drugs Ostrowe prescribed for his former wife were
similar to what he knew of Burt's procedures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ostrowe order 75 milligrams
of the painkiller Demerol, 10 milligrams of the sedative Valium and
other drugs to ease Turner's pain and to help her sleep.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ducote asked Busacco if
he'd ever seen that combination and dosage of drugs before.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Busacco said Burt used that
some "cocktail" for sleep and sedation. Busacco called the drug
mixture "an inordinate amount of medication."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But questioned by Koch,
Busacco said the medicine and dosages did not violate a widely
accepted standard of care.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier in the trial, a
nurse who worked at <a href="http://www.womans.com/">Woman's
Hospital</a> in 1972 said the consent forms signed by Ostrowe and
Turner before the operation were standard for that time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sandra Smith testified that
just writing the word "surgery" to describe the type of operation a
patient was about to undergo was how things were done 24 years
ago.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She also noted that
Turner's signature appears on the Consent to Operation,
Anesthetics, and other forms, and that a registered nurse witnessed
the signatures.</p>
