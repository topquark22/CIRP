            Lawsuit</h2>

            <h3>Stage Set for Men to Sue for Being Circumcised as
            Infants</h3>

            <p>SUFFOLK COUNTY, New York &ndash; After a
            two-and-a-half year legal battle with Plaintiff William
            G. Stowell, the doctor and <a
            href="http://www.webspan.net/~goodsam/GoodSamHosp.html"
            target="_blank">hospital</a> have settled the landmark
            circumcision case brought against them. The terms of
            the settlements have not been publicly disclosed.
            Twenty-one-year old Stowell filed <a
            href="/news/newsweek02-26-01/">suit</a> December 19,
            2000, in the U. S. District Court for the Eastern
            District of New York, against the hospital where he was
            circumcised and the physician who circumcised him as a
            newborn.</p>

            <p>Stowell, born on December 22, 1981, in West Islip,
            NY, was circumcised the following day by his mother's
            obstetrician. This case presented the issue of the
            legal validity of consent for circumcision obtained by
            a nurse from a mother who was debilitated by the
            effects of a Caesarian section and painkillers. It also
            questioned whether a physician could legally and
            ethically remove healthy, normal tissue from a
            non-consenting minor for non-therapeutic reasons.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://firms.findlaw.com//llewellynlaw/practices.htm"
            target="_blank">David J. Llewellyn</a>, one of
            Plaintiff Stowell's attorneys, said, "William and I are
            very happy that we were able to resolve this case with
            both the hospital and the doctor. While a settlement is
            never an admission of liability, I believe it shows
            that our allegations were taken seriously. <span
            class="yellow">Never again can someone say that a young
            man who is dissatisfied with his circumcision as an
            infant is being frivolous when he objects to his
            mutilation and brings suit to obtain justice. This case
            should send a message to doctors that they run the risk
            of a lawsuit each time they circumcise an infant for
            non-therapeutic reasons, particularly when they rely on
            the hospital to obtain consent the day after
            birth.&nbsp; Social or cosmetic concerns provide no
            justification for harmful surgery.&nbsp; I would expect
            that this is just the first of many cases that will be
            brought by angry circumcised young men against their
            circumcisers."</span></p>

            <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) first
            acknowledged that there was no medical justification
            for routine circumcision in <a
            href="/library/statements/aap/#1971">1971</a>. In <a
            href="/library/statements/aap1999/">1999</a>, the AAP
            reaffirmed that it does not recommend routine
            circumcision.&nbsp; The American Medical Association
            concurred in <a
            href="/library/statements/ama2000/">2000</a>, calling
            routine circumcision "non-therapeutic." No national or
            international medical organization recommends routine
            circumcision.</p>
