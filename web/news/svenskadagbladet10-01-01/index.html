      <h2>Law on circumcision arouses protests</h2>

      <p>The new law on circumcision which comes into force on
      Monday has aroused reactions from around the whole world.
      Beginning October 1, circumcision of boys may only be
      performed by those who are doctors or have the necessary
      competence. The child must receive pain relief, and this must
      be given by a doctor or qualified nurse.</p>

      <p>It is precisely the latter (requirement) that has provoked
      the strongest opposition among the world's Jewish
      communities, and the Swedish parliament has been accused of
      instituting the first law against Jewish religious practice
      since the Second World War.</p>

      <p>In the Jewish tradition circumcision is performed by a
      mohel, a specially trained person who must be Jewish. A
      pain-relieving ointment is used for the operation. With the
      new law, both pain relief and medical personnel are required
      for the operation. (TT newsagency)</p>
