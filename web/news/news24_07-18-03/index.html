            <p>Willemien Br&uuml;er</p>

            <p>Cape Town - Researchers at the <a
            href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Medical
            Research Council</a> have established that circumcision
            is not, as previously thought, a way to prevent the
            spread of HIV/Aids among heterosexual men.</p>

            <p>Some previous studies have indicated that
            circumcision could prevent the spread of the virus.</p>

            <p>Dr Nandi Siegfried says: "<span class="yellow">It's
            not true, because men who have been circumcised can get
            HIV/Aids.</span>"</p>

            <p>She formed part of a group who published an article
            about the subject in the highly-respected <a
            href="http://www.nelh.nhs.uk/cochrane.asp/"
            target="_blank">Cochrane Library</a> database. Among
            her co-workers were associates of Cape Town, Oxford,
            Bristol, Liverpool and the British Medical Research
            Council.</p>

            <p>Siegfried says studies now being undertaken have
            indicated that circumcision could prevent the spread of
            the disease to some degree, but until the research has
            been completed, "it may be irresponsible to say
            circumcision will be a fool-proof method."</p>

            <p>The researchers have completed a review of 35 case
            studies using research methods developed by the
            international Cochrane collaboration database. It
            differs from previous reviews in that case studies from
            all over the world have been incorporated.</p>

            <p>Siegfried is of the opinion that previous research
            was not always of a high standard, because some didn't
            make use of control groups.</p>

            <p>A study is being undertaken among 1&nbsp;750 Gauteng
            men who will be circumcised and a similar control group
            who will not be circumcised. The men will be tested at
            3, 12 and 21 months for HIV/Aids and results will be
            compared afterwards.</p>

            <p>Similar studies are now being done in Kenya and
            Uganda.</p>
