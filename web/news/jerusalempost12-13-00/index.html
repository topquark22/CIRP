      <h2>Court ruling threatens traditional circumcision</h2>

      <p>By Judy Siegel</p>

      <p>(December 13) - Monday's <a
      href="http://www.court.gov.il/mishpat/html/en/home/index.html"
       target="_blank">High Court of Justice</a> ruling that any
      physician approved by a hospital can perform circumcisions
      will in effect mean the end of the profession of non-medical
      ritual circumcisers (mohalim), according to Rabbi Yosef
      Weisberg, national supervisor of the Health and Religious
      Affairs ministries' and Chief Rabbinate's national commission
      in charge of mohalim.</p>

      <p>Weisberg, a certified mohel who has performed the ritual
      on tens of thousands of children, told <i>The Jerusalem
      Post</i> that already, many mohalim in the Dan Region have
      changed profession to kashrut supervisors and Talmud Torah
      teachers because of the lack of work, as secular parents and
      some religious ones as well, have chosen physicians to
      circumcise their sons. "The public has more confidence in
      doctors, even though mohalim have a lot more experience and
      expertise in circumcision," Weisberg said with dismay. He
      added that parents - even some religious ones - want the
      circumciser to wear surgical gloves when performing the brit
      mila (circumcision), but Jewish law prohibits this except in
      unusual cases as when the mother is a hepatitis B or HIV
      carrier. "The sages require that the edge of foreskin be
      ripped using the fingernail, and you can't do this wearing
      gloves. There are also parents who insist on anesthesia, but
      this too is not permitted by Jewish law. Physicians will not
      care about these strictures." The High Court dealt with the
      issue when Mila Tova, a private clinic using urological
      surgeons, protested against the Health Ministry's refusal to
      include the doctors on its list of approved mohalim. When it
      realized that it could not limit circumcision only to
      mohalim, the ministry decided to adopt a new policy in which
      any hospital director could grant approval to doctors to
      perform a brit mila.</p>

      <p>Ministry Acting Director-General Boaz Lev said that
      according to existing laws, any M.D. can perform any medical
      procedure. "I wouldn't expect a hospital director to allow an
      intern studying psychiatry to do circumcisions, as he and the
      doctor would have to bear responsibility," Lev said. "But the
      ministry itself will not set down what type of doctor can
      perform them." Weisberg, author of an authoritative book on
      circumcision, Otzar Habrit, said that he knows of many
      physicians who have closed their practices and taken up the
      profession of circumciser. "They charge NIS 2,000 for a brit,
      and - unlike mohalim - they don't visit the family to see the
      baby before or after it. The official rate for mohalim is NIS
      500."</p>
