            lives</h2>

            <p>BY LULAMILE FENI</p>

            <p>TEN initiates have already died of botched
            circumcision since the beginning of the summer season
            and another 32 are fighting for their lives at Eastern
            Cape hospitals.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Last week the police had to
            exhume the body of a 17-year-old youth from
            Sterkspruit, buried inside his initiation hut.</span>
            They had not been notified of his death.</p>

            <p>Drakensberg area spokesperson Captain Ursula
            Roelofse said the initiate was allegedly buried by some
            men from Tyinindini village near Matsoeseng in
            Sterkspruit.</p>

            <p>"According to the information, the burial was done
            according to the culture of the people (Basotho and
            amaHlubi) of the area," Roelofse said.</p>

            <p>"According to their culture a dead initiate is
            buried at the initiation school soon after his death.
            Although we are not undermining anyone's culture,
            people should remember that as police we have an
            obligation to investigate any ... death. People cannot
            bury people left and right as they please."</p>

            <p>Roelofse said an inquest docket has been opened and
            the cause of death has not been established.</p>

            <p>Health spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said of the 10 who
            had died, one was from Port St Johns, two from Mthatha,
            one from Ngqeleni, one from Dutywa, one from Bizana,
            two from Mdantsane and two from Sterkspruit.</p>

            <p>"This is the first time that an initiate has died at
            Dutywa," Kupelo said.</p>

            <p>"Dutywa, Keiskammahoek and Peddie are some of the
            places said to be safe and had had a history of no
            initiation injuries."</p>

            <p>He said the 32 initiates had been admitted in
            hospitals for gangrene and dehydration. Seven of these
            are from Mdantsane and the Transkei.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said botched circumcisions cost the
            provincial government over R10 million a year.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said last weekend his department closed down
            five initiation schools, rescued 122 initiates and
            arrested eight people for running illegal initiation
            schools in the Transkei.</p>

            <p>He said the initiates had been circumcised without
            their parents' knowledge.</p>

            <p>Midway through the 2005 summer season the death toll
            almost equals that of last summer when 12 initiates
            died.</p>
