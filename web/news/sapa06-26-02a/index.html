            <p>Johannesburg - A Randburg baby died and his twin
            brother was in a stable condition at <a
            href="http://www.wits.ac.za/fac/med/paediatrics/jhb/jhb.htm"
             target="_blank">Johannesburg General Hospital</a>
            following the children's circumcision on Tuesday,
            Gauteng police said.</p>

            <p>A 36-year-old Nigerian-born man was arrested on
            charges of murder and attempted murder after the
            incident. The babies' father (35) was arrested for
            complicity, Captain Schalk Bornman said on
            Wednesday.</p>

            <p>The twins' parents brought the children to the
            hospital on Wednesday morning after they realised that
            the babies were bleeding profusely after the
            circumcision which was allegedly carried out by the
            Nigerian.</p>

            <p>The babies' father took the children, without the
            consent of their 27-year-old mother to the Nigerian man
            who allegedly carried out regular circumcisions on
            young children in Hillbrow, Johannesburg.</p>

            <p>Late on Tuesday night, the boys' parents discovered
            that their babies were still bleeding and decided to
            take them to hospital for treatment, said Bornman.</p>

            <p>He said the one baby died around 13:00 on Wednesday
            and the other one was still receiving treatment. It was
            in a stable condition.</p>

            <p>The arrest came after hospital staff informed the
            police about the incident following blood tests, and
            captured the two men later.</p>

            <p>A post mortem to determine the exact cause of the
            baby's death would be conducted, said Bornman.</p>
