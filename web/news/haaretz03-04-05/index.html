            <h2>U.S. rabbis approve using tube to remove
            circumcision blood</h2>
            By Reuters 

            <p>NEW YORK - Rabbis should use a tube to suck blood
            from circumcision wounds rather than sucking directly
            with their mouths to protect infants and rabbis from
            disease, the leading Orthodox rabbinical group <a
            href="http://www.rabbis.org/news/030105.cfm"
            target="_blank">said yesterday</a>. In a traditional
            Orthodox practice during the brit, or circumcision
            ritual of baby boys, rabbis have been using their
            mouths to suck blood from the penis wounds and
            surrounding tissue for thousands of years.</p>

            <p>The use of a sterile tube is an acceptable
            substitute for direct mouth contact based upon a review
            of science and religious writings and Torah
            authorities, said Rabbi Basil Herring of the <a
            href="http://www.rabbis.org/"
            target="_blank">Rabbinical Council of America</a>,
            which sets policies for and represents about half of
            America's Orthodox rabbis, as well as sponsoring a
            Jewish court.</p>

            <p>"We strongly urge rabbis and congregations to adhere
            to this method," said Herring, who added that it's
            possible that the preference may not be adopted by all
            Orthodox rabbis, as Jewish religious leaders often have
            different views.</p>

            <p>The traditional practice has been under scrutiny
            after <a
            href="http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/doh/home.html"
            target="_blank">New York City health officials</a> went
            to court late last year to stop a rabbi from performing
            the practice, which they believe may have led to the
            death of a baby boy from herpes.</p>

            <p>The baby was one of three infants that health
            officials said contracted the herpes simplex virus
            after being circumcised by <a
            href="http://www.bris-milah.com/" target="_blank">Rabbi
            Yitzchok Fischer</a>, who used his mouth to draw blood
            from the infant's wound.</p>
