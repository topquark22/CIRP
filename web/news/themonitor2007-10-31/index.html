            <h2>Uganda: Don't Impose Circumcision On Natives!</h2>
            OPINION 

            <p>Franklin Okot</p>

            <p>So interesting and laughable, I first dismissed it
            as Mickey Mouse. Never did I expect circumcision to
            become a national policy, leave alone an 'international
            arsenal' in the war against HIV/Aids. Modern scientific
            research risks losing relevance through half-measures
            and conflicting theories.<br />
            <br />
             It's now part and parcel of President Bush's politics
            and weapons of mass deception. Instead of focusing on a
            cure, authorities are tagging African men to undergo
            rituals once reserved for Muslims and few ethnicities
            after "rediscovering circumcision." It's obvious,
            nothing short of a cure will only lead to the
            proliferation of HIV.<br />
            <br />
             But why get rid of the virus now when there's so much
            money to be made? I'm blowing the whistle on this
            mundane conspiracy theory as Uganda, my country of
            birth, considered as having a "rosy" Aids record
            qualifies for President Bush's $15b anti-Aids fund to
            make circumcision readily available.<br />
            <br />
             President Museveni deserves accolades for prevailing
            over all his rivals and hanging on for over 20 years,
            but as a champion in the war against Aids? Forget!
            Whose soldiers spread HIV like bushfire all over the
            Great Lakes? Who's notorious for stigmatising people
            with HIV/Aids, recently blasting victims as
            "treasonous"? It's a golden handshake to a fellow
            "Warrior President" and his mercenary elites who have
            hitched their wagon to the U.S "global war on
            terror."<br />
            <br />
             Two of Uganda's health ministers charged with
            embezzling millions meant for immunising children are
            allowed to laugh all the way to the bank while millions
            burn in poverty. President Museveni was merely posing
            as a champion of the war on corruption in order to
            placate the Queen who had threatened to cancel a royal
            appearance at the forthcoming Commonwealth summit this
            month due to "growing corruption."<br />
            <br />
             Not only that, the president is apparently
            curry-flavouring with donors, eyes set on even bigger
            proceeds, America's $10.4b anti-corruption money under
            the Millennium Account. In what's reminiscent of The
            River Between, neighbouring Kenya has jumped in with
            such zeal that uncircumcised students were barred from
            school.<br />
            <br />
             Like Uganda, scavenging politicians competing for
            American patronage are in the final stages of
            developing a circumcision policy. I'm warning against
            the imposition of a tradition many consider
            alien.<br />
            <br />
             To the Acholi and other Nilotic groups, circumcision
            arouses bitter resentment and reminds them of slavery,
            ethnic cleansing and forced Islamisation. A circumcised
            phallus, according my people, resembles somebody
            donning a red fez or tarboush headgear, an indirect
            reference to Nubian agents who operated in ways
            resembling today's Janjaweed (1860s-80s), ravaging
            Equatoria Province, covering southern Sudan and
            northern Uganda. Idi Amin opened the old wounds, but
            nobody will beat Joseph Kony, though a kinsman, armed
            by Khartoum Islamic government to counter
            Museveni/Bush's support for the SPLA.<br />
            <br />
             People like Dr Elioda Tumwesigye, chairman of the
            "prostituted" parliamentary committee on HIV/Aids,
            who's supposed to know better, are tagging even small
            children. Is he aware that even advanced countries like
            Canada are backtracking on what was once compulsory at
            birth, to give infants freedom to decide as adults?
            Child Circumcision is a form of child-abuse, much like
            Female Genital Mutilation as research has proved that
            newborns suffer more pain than adults.<br />
            <br />
             Soon ignoramuses will be jumping up and down with
            euphoria: "They're now immune to HIV because they've
            shed blood. Gullible ones who believe that the latter
            have an edge over the uncircumcised, beware:
            Circumcision isn't worth the pain. After visiting
            Uganda in 2003, I too fell into circumcision mindset
            and decided to defy tradition.<br />
            <br />
             Back in Toronto, I approached my doctor who stopped me
            in my tracks: Circumcision doesn't increase sensation;
            quite the opposite. The myth that the low rate of
            HIV/Aids infection and death in the Islamic world is
            due to circumcision is beyond naivet&eacute;. Are the
            Bagisu, the Kikuyu, and homosexuals faring any better?
            It's Islamic austerity and discipline. While others
            have stood up bravely in the clash of cultures, Western
            lifestyles ride roughshod over our cultures and
            traditions.<br />
            <br />
             Egypt, once known as "the flesh-pot," has cut back on
            bourgeois decadence, African pros keep a high-profile
            African using skin lighteners, preferring Whites who
            give them freedom to flirt, drink and smoke even bhang.
            There are some Egyptian mistresses with trademark
            mobiles trying to make ends meet.<br />
            <br />
             So ignorant, they throw condom in your face, "What's
            this?" Though a desert, Egypt is able to take care of
            its population, unlike "black" Africa where mosquitoes
            feast mercilessly on bodies wrecked by alcohol and
            malnutrition. Accidents, another major African killer,
            are a rarity in the land of pharaohs despite thundering
            traffic (or mild) as drivers are sober).<br />
            <br />
             Whatever its merits, circumcision alone, without
            tackling corruption of the mind, body and soul, is a
            roadmap to more trouble. The new "discovery" is a
            tsunami that will spread, not counter HIV/Aids. It will
            also roll back Museveni's "rosy record" on HIV/Aids, as
            simple-minded Africans will throw caution to the
            wind.</p>
