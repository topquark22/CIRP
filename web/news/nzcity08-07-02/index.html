            <h4>Children's Commissioner says the circumcision of
            boys should be made illegal, unless it is for good
            medical reasons</h4>

            <p>7 August 2002</p>

            <p>The Children's Commissioner is to ask the Government
            to consider making the circumcision of boys illegal,
            unless it is for good medical reasons.</p>

            <p><a href="/news/nzherald08-06-02/">An Auckland
            pediatrician is concerned at the growing number of
            times he has had to perform corrective surgery after
            the initial operation went wrong</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.surgeons.org/"
            target="_blank">The Royal College of Surgeons</a> says
            it is aware of those concerns, and wants circumcisions
            only performed by GPs who have the proper
            qualifications.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.occ.org.nz/aboutus/"
            target="_blank">Children's Commissioner</a> Roger McLay
            says it seems to be a tradition that boys are
            circumcised because their fathers were.</p>

            <p>He says that is no reason to do something that may
            infringe a baby's rights.</p>
