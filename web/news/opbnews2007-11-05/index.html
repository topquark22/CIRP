            <h2>Oregon Supreme Court Hears Circumcision Case</h2>

            <p>By Colin Fogarty</p>

            <p>Circumcision is not as common as it used to be in
            this country. About 60 per cent of boys born in the
            U.S. get circumcised, many for religious reasons, or
            just so the son can look like the father.<br />
            <br />
             The <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/index.htm"
             target="_blank">Oregon Supreme Court</a> hears oral
            arguments Tuesday on whether a divorced man who
            converted to Judaism can have his 12-year-old son
            circumcised. The boy?s mother objects. As Colin Fogarty
            reports, the case could have far reaching
            consequences.<br />
            <br />
             <b>Circumcision goes way back in Judaism.</b><br />
            <br />
             Daniel Isaac: "It is the oldest Jewish custom that
            we're aware of."<br />
            <br />
             Rabbi Daniel Isaac, with <a
            href="http://www.nevehshalom.org/"
            target="_blank">Congregation Neveh Shalom</a> in
            Portland says the ritual has been practiced ever since
            Abraham made a deal with God.<br />
            <br />
             Daniel Isaac: "At various points in Jewish history,
            there have been tyrants who tried to separate Jews from
            their Judaism, one of the first things they did was to
            outlaw circumcision."<br />
            <br />
             Isaac says that's why he and other rabbis are paying
            close attention to a custody dispute case before the
            Oregon Supreme Court.<br />
            <br />
             Here are the basic facts: James Boldt and his ex-wife
            Lia Boldt have a 12-year-old son. James Boldt -- who
            has full custody of the boy -- converted to Judaism in
            2004. And he wants his son to be Jewish too. But the
            boy's mother is Russian Orthodox and she objects
            strenuously to having her son circumcised.<br />
            <br />
             Rabbi Isaac says under Jewish tradition, the faith is
            passed from mother to child. So he says if the boy was
            born to Jewish parents, he'd be considered Jewish
            whether he was circumcised or not.<br />
            <br />
             Daniel Isaac: "But a child whose parents when the
            child was born was not Jewish, then the circumcision
            becomes one of the steps to the conversion process.
            That varies perhaps from congregation to congregation.
            But if the child is being welcomed into the community
            as a member of the community, the child should have
            gone through the conversion process."<br />
            <br />
             That varies from congregation to congregation because
            not all Jews agree on how important circumcision is to
            conversion and not all Jews agree the faith can only be
            passed from the mother. And some even oppose
            circumcision altogether.<br />
            <br />
             Lia Boldt is getting legal backing from the
            Seattle-based group, <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>. Its
            director John Geisheker considers circumcision at any
            age to be medically unnecessary and cruel.<br />
            <br />
             John Geisheker: "It's too horrific. The benefit isn't
            there. And plus, it changes the mechanics of sexual
            intercourse, a fact of life that he's entitled to when
            he's an adult."<br />
            <br />
             Geisheker says like all procedures, circumcision comes
            with medical risks. And that's why he goes on to argue
            that the father in this case has no right to circumcise
            his 12-year-old boy.<br />
            <br />
             John Geisheker: "See we don't see this as a dispute
            between the parents. We view it as a case about the
            rights of a child to be free from any kind of imaginary
            cultural surgeries inflicted by the parents for
            whatever reason, however spiritually and deeply
            held."<br />
            <br />
             And that's what has Jewish advocacy groups upset about
            this case.<br />
            <br />
             Marc Stern, with the <a
            href="http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer"
            target="_blank">American Jewish Congress</a>, says
            denying James Boldt the right to circumcise his son
            would violate his religious freedom. Stern says because
            this is the first appeals court to decide this issue,
            the precedent it would set could kick off a spate of
            lawsuits over circumcision across the country.<br />
            <br />
             Marc Stern: "The worst case scenario is that the
            Oregon Supreme Court says this inflicts a permanent
            change on the body of a child, it's therefore beyond
            the can of any parent &ndash; divorced or not &ndash;
            to consent to such a procedure. And if we lose, it's a
            sure thing that there will be other lawsuits in other
            states."<br />
            <br />
             No matter what the legal precedent, Rabbi Daniel Isaac
            is more concerned about the boy at the center of the
            case. In court briefs, Lia Boldt said her son told her
            he didn't want a circumcision, but was afraid of
            contradicting his father.<br />
            <br />
             Isaac takes the father's side in the legal case, but
            he wishes the couple could work out a compromise.<br />
            <br />
             Daniel Isaac: "It's difficult when you have parents
            that are divorced and arguing not just about this, but
            about everything. But I would be hesitant for Judaism
            to become yet another issue between the parents."<br />
            <br />
             James and Lia Boldt declined to be interviewed, as did
            their attorneys.<br />
            <br />
             Circumcision opponents are asking the Oregon Supreme
            Court to look to a trial <a
            href="/news/chicagotribune2006-10-24/"
            target="_blank">court case last year in Chicago</a>. A
            divorced mother wanted her son circumcised, but the
            father did not. The judge in that case did not rule on
            the religious issues. Instead, he blocked the
            circumcision until the boy turned 18 and could decide
            for himself.</p>
