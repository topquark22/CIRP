            <h2>More parents choosing to skip circumcision</h2>

            <h4>Majority of boys don't get surgery, but some
            doctors still doing it</h4>

            <p>Katherine Dedyna, Times Colonist<br />
             Published: Thursday, January 31, 2008</p>

            <p>Victoria mother Kira Antinuk has a motto she wishes
            parents and doctors would adopt for the baby boys of
            B.C.: "May the foreskin be with you."<br />
            <br />
             When she was pregnant with her son Dante, now four,
            she saw a <a href="http://www.intact.ca/vidintro.htm"
            target="_blank">video clip of a circumcision</a> that
            changed her life -- galvanizing her into working
            against the removal of healthy tissue in normal
            babies.<br />
            <br />
             Along with caring for Dante and newborn daughter,
            Kiana, Antinuk devotes up to three hours daily to
            posting on family-oriented websites based in the U.S.,
            where the circumcision rate is higher than in
            Canada.<br />
            <br />
             Kira Antinuk, holding one-month-old daughter Kiana, is
            against circumcision for her four-year-old son Dante
            and advocates against the procedure.<br />
            <br />
             The majority of babies in B.C. are no longer routinely
            circumcised. The provincial health plan stopped paying
            for the procedure years ago, and Victoria hospitals
            provide only medically necessary circumcisions. In
            2006, that totalled two babies at <a
            href="http://www.viha.ca/finding_care/facilities/victoria_general_hospital.htm"
             target="_blank">Victoria General Hospital</a>.<br />
            <br />
             But there are still three MDs performing circumcisions
            in Victoria. Two of them interviewed by the Times
            Colonist estimate they perform more than 300
            circumcisions between them in a year while a third
            could not be reached for comment.<br />
            <br />
             "That's hundreds too many," Antinuk, 27, says. Without
            religious or medical reasons "doctors should not be
            allowed to do it."<br />
            <br />
             Dr. Catherine Stubbs of Oak Bay says by doing
            circumcisions, she's providing a service for parents
            who feel shamed by other parents, prenatal educators
            and even doctors in doing what they think is best for
            their sons.<br />
            <br />
             "Doctors lie to patients right now," Stubbs says.
            "They tell them it's not available; they tell them it's
            going to cost them $500; they tell them it will scar
            their children for a lifetime. There are many, many
            circumcised men in this world that are perfectly
            enjoying their penises, and their wives are."<br />
            <br />
             She performs one to four circumcisions per week.
            Retired physician Chorkie Chan says he has been
            circumcising about three infants a week, filling in for
            another physician on maternity leave. Both charge about
            $75 for the procedure.<br />
            <br />
             <a href="http://www.uvic.ca/"
            target="_blank">University of Victoria</a> medical
            ethics expert <a
            href="http://communications.uvic.ca/research/details.php?go=1&amp;id=534"
             target="_blank">Eike Kluge</a> agrees with Antinuk
            that circumcisions should stop, except when medically
            necessary.<br />
            <br />
             "It's mutilation," says Kluge, a former director of
            ethics for the <a
            href="http://www.cma.ca/index.cfm/ci_id/121/la_id/1.htm"
             target="_blank">Canadian Medical Association</a>. "For
            physicians to engage in this is, in fact, to act
            ethically inappropriately."<br />
            <br />
             The <a href="https://www.cpsbc.ca/cps"
            target="_blank">College of Physicians and Surgeons of
            B.C.</a>, the regulatory body for doctors, is upfront
            about calling circumcision of baby boys a "medically
            unnecessary intervention" without therapeutic value,
            but would not comment on the allegation that
            circumcision is mutilation.<br />
            <br />
             Registrar Dr. Morris VanAndel won't be pushing for a
            ban, saying "a degree of discretion" is appropriate for
            doctors. Moreover, because the majority of physicians,
            especially younger ones, want no part of circumcision,
            the practice will run its course without "thou shalt
            not" edicts, he expects.<br />
            <br />
             Doctors are required to get informed consent, meaning
            parents must be made to understand all the
            drawbacks.<br />
            <br />
             The college's <a
            href="https://www.cpsbc.ca/cps/physician_resources/publications/resource_manual/malecircum"
             target="_blank">2005 position paper</a> notes many
            ethical concerns and the possibility of babies bleeding
            to death -- the fate of <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/pdf/BCcoroner_2004.pdf"
             target="_blank">Vernon infant Ryleigh McWillis in
            2002</a>.<br />
            <br />
             The idea that doctors accede to parents who want their
            sons circumcised to "be like daddy" strikes Antinuk as
            a cruel deprivation of boys' rights to intact
            bodies.<br />
            <br />
             But Stubbs maintains she will not circumcise a boy
            only for that reason. Both she and Chan say their most
            common request is from parents who knew of
            uncircumcised men who suffered urinary tract infections
            or tight foreskins.<br />
            <br />
             Kluge says the research does not support the infection
            notion. "People come down with appendicitis. Are you
            therefore going to give an appendectomy to
            everybody?"<br />
            <br />
             While religious arguments could trump security of the
            person provisions of the <a
            href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/"
            target="_blank">Charter of Rights</a>, Kluge notes that
            the Jewish and Islamic religions, which require
            circumcision, have persons trained to do them, negating
            the need for physicians to be involved.<br />
            <br />
             Trained mohels do "a better job," claims Victoria
            Rabbi Meir Kaplan, who disagrees that circumcision is
            mutilation.<br />
            <br />
             Kaplan defends the infant practice, saying that Jewish
            males would not be happy undergoing a more painful
            procedure under general anesthetic in adulthood instead
            of a 10-second tradition at the age of eight
            days.<br />
            <br />
             Antinuk hopes a B.C. man will launch a lawsuit over
            his own infant circumcision -- a tough decision to
            take.<br />
            <br />
             "You would have to bare your genitalia, symbolically,
            in public," Kluge says. That man would have to sue his
            parents for their decision.<br />
            <br />
             The B.C. college has been approached by men
            circumcised as infants, but the complaints went nowhere
            because the doctors were retired or dead.<br />
            <br />
             Female genital mutilation has been against the law in
            Canada since 1997 and Antinuk says the college should
            extend the same protection to boys.<br />
            <br />
             Meanwhile, Stubbs has had only two circumcised baby
            boys who have had late bleeds in her 35 years of
            practice and once in a while, a baby requires a stitch
            or silver nitrite.<br />
            <br />
             She uses both topical and local anesthetic. Many of
            the babies she circumcises nurse or even sleep during
            the procedure. "The majority of babies can be done
            totally pain-free."</p>

            <h2>CIRCUMCISION NUMBERS</h2>

            <h4>AIDS LINK QUESTIONED</h4>

            <p>Last year, the World Health Organization hailed
            circumcision as a way to combat HIV in ravaged areas,
            citing evidence showing a 60 per cent drop in infection
            rates in circumcised men in South Africa, Uganda and
            Kenya. <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/de_witte2007/"
             target="_blank">Circumcision removes specialized
            Langerhans cells in the foreskin that readily attach to
            viruses, including HIV</a>.<br />
            <br />
             But the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov"
            target="_blank">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
            Prevention</a> recently concluded <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/millet2007/"
             target="_blank">circumcision did not affect
            susceptibility among American black and Latino men,
            whose HIV rate is several times higher than for
            whites</a>. In the U.S., men having sex with men is the
            major cause of HIV; in Africa it is male-female
            intercourse.</p>

            <h4>PROS AND CONS</h4>

            <p>According to the <a href="http://www.cps.ca"
            target="_blank">Canadian Pediatric Society</a>, of
            every <a
            href="http://www.caringforkids.cps.ca/babies/Circumcision.htm"
             target="_blank">1,000 circumcised boys</a>:<br />
            <br />
             - 20 to 30 will experience too much bleeding or
            infection<br />
            <br />
             - two to three will have more serious complications
            such as too much skin removed or more serious
            bleeding<br />
            <br />
             - 10 will need a second circumcision because of "poor
            result" in the first<br />
            <br />
             Of every 1,000 uncircumcised boys:<br />
            <br />
             - seven will be hospitalized for a urinary tract
            infection before they reach age one<br />
             - 10 will have a later circumcision for medical
            reasons, such as a scarred opening of the foreskin
            because of recurrent infections and will require
            general anesthetic.</p>

            <h4>VICTORIA STATISTICS</h4>

            <p>About 2,000 boys were born in Greater Victoria last
            year. <span class="yellow">The circumcision rate has
            slipped from 22 per cent a decade ago, to about 15 per
            cent, judging by estimates made by two local physicians
            doing the procedure.</span><br />
            <br />
             Seventy circumcisions were done at the <a
            href="http://www.viha.ca/finding_care/facilities/victoria_general_hospital.htm"
             target="_blank">Victoria General</a> and <a
            href="http://www.viha.ca/finding_care/facilities/royal_jubilee_hospital.htm"
             target="_blank">Royal Jubilee</a> hospitals during
            2006-07.<br />
            <br />
             Of those, 30 were done on boys under 15 (including two
            under age one) and 40 on males over age 15.</p>
