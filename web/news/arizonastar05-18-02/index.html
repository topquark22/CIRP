      <h2>Circumcision payments denied as Senate seeks to save
      $400K</h2>

      <p>PHOENIX - Saying no cut is too small to balance the
      budget, the state Senate refused Friday to pay for
      circumcision of baby boys born to poor women.</p>

      <p>On a voice vote, lawmakers rejected a proposal to add
      $400,000 to the state budget to pay for the procedure. They
      were unconvinced by arguments by Sen. Susan Gerard,
      R-Phoenix, that the expense - less than one one-hundredth of
      a percent of the $6.5 billion budget - is a worthwhile
      expense, from both a social and a health standpoint.</p>

      <p>"I don't think you want to make poor newborn males
      potentially be differentiated from other newborn males
      because their parents couldn't afford to have them
      circumcised," Gerard said.</p>

      <p>The procedure is now included in the <a
      href="http://www.ahcccs.state.az.us/" target="_blank">Arizona
      Health Care Cost Containment System</a>.</p>

      <p>Gerard also said there is a "strong link" between men who
      are uncircumcised and the women they are with developing
      cervical cancer.</p>

      <p>"I don't think we really want to be responsible for that,"
      she said. "We'll probably find ourselves being sued down the
      road for that one."</p>

      <p>Sen. Dean Martin, R-Phoenix, agreed. "These cutbacks are
      going a little too far," he said.</p>

      <p>But most lawmakers ended up siding with Sen. Ruth Solomon,
      D-Tucson. She said the decision was part of the overall
      budget deal with the House.</p>
