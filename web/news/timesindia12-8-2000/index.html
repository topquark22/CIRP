      <h2>Circumcision is sexual assault, says psychologist</h2>
      SYDNEY: Male circumcision is tantamount to sexual assault and
      should be banned in Australia along with female genital
      mutilation, an international conference in Sydney was told on
      Thursday. Psychology Professor <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.bond.edu.au/hss/staff/gboyle.htm">Greg
      Boyle</a> told the sixth international symposium on genital
      integrity that cutting the foreskin could result in
      psychological and sexual problems in adulthood. 

      <p>''Studies now demonstrate quite clearly that circumcision
      has long-term adverse consequences, not only physically but
      also sexually and psychologically,'' Boyle, of Queensland's
      <a href="http://www.bond.edu.au/" target="_blank">Bond
      University</a>, told the delegates.</p>

      <p>''To amputate a highly erogenous sexual tissue such as the
      foreskin is quite clearly a criminal sexual assault.''</p>

      <p>An estimated 12 per cent of infant boys in Australia have
      their foreskins surgically removed - down from 90 per cent in
      the 1950s.</p>

      <p>Boyle claimed Australia was moving towards making
      circumcision a crime, quoting as evidence an increasing tide
      of litigation against doctors who performed it.</p>

      <p>In an <a href="/news/perth1/">out-of-court settlement</a>
      last year, a 24-year-old Perth man received A$360,000
      ($194,000) compensation from the doctor who circumcised him
      as an infant.</p>

      <p>Boyle said it was a violation of Australia's
      anti-discrimination laws to ban female genital mutilation
      while failing to give boys the same protection.</p>

      <p>Female genital mutilation is illegal in Australia under
      laws introduced in 1995. (DPA)</p>
