            <h2>DA: crackdown on Gauteng initiation schools</h2>

            <p>The Gauteng provincial government needs to crack
            down on illegal initiation schools and consider
            legislation to regulate circumcision as done in the
            Eastern Cape, the DA said on Friday.<br />
            <br />
             Spokesperson Jack Bloom called on the <a
            href="http://www.health.gpg.gov.za/htm/index.htm"
            target="_blank">Gauteng health department</a> to
            speedily pass legislation to regulate these schools, so
            that the boys' health was protected while a cultural
            tradition was retained.<br />
            <br />
             This comes after an initiation school was closed down
            in Hammanskraal, north of Pretoria, after 100 underage
            boys were removed from it on Thursday.<br />
            <br />
             "I commend the police for closing down the initiation
            school in as it failed to comply with municipal
            by-laws.<br />
            <br />
             "We need to curb these fraudulent schools as there is
            much abuse. While it is not as big a problem in Gauteng
            as elsewhere, there have been deaths and many initiates
            have ended up in hospital," said Bloom.<br />
            <br />
             North West police spokesperson Inspector Llife Ramatlo
            said the parents of a 15-year-old boy at the
            Hammanskraal school had complained to a ward councillor
            in the area after their son's condition worsened after
            being circumcised at the school.<br />
            <br />
             On Wednesday, the parents and the ward councillor,
            accompanied by Temba police went to the school. He said
            the school was closed down after boys, aged between
            eight and 15, were removed from it.<br />
            <br />
             "The principal has a certificate to operate but the
            boys were underage," said Ramatlo.<br />
            <br />
             "Some of the initiates' parents did not know their
            children were at the school," he said.<br />
            <br />
             Meanwhile, in Limpopo, four initiates died from
            diarrhoea this week, police said. - Sapa</p>
