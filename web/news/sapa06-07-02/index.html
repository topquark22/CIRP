      <h2>Patient's penis cut by 1.5cm</h2>

      <p>Taipei - A Taiwan doctor was jailed for six months on
      Friday for cutting short a patient's penis while performing
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>The patient, identified only by his surname Chang, went to
      the hospital in Tainan county on July 7 last year for
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>During the process, the doctor, whose surname is also
      Chang, cut off the tip of the patient's penis by 1.5
      centimetres.</p>

      <p>The patient sued Dr Chang, but he and Dr Chang reached an
      out-of-court settlement, with Dr Chang paying him 170 000
      Taiwan dollars (US$5 000) and 500 000 Taiwan dollars (US$15
      000) in compensation.</p>

      <p>But since the suit had been filed, the Tainan District
      Court still sentenced Dr Chang to six months' imprisonment on
      charges of causing injury to patient due to negligence. -
