            <h2>No shortcuts in circumcision</h2>

            <p><b>Snippety, snip, snip. Could that be the sound</b>
            of AIDS in retreat in Africa?<br />
            <br />
             The auditory metaphor and its effect come to mind if
            you spend any time reflecting on a much-publicized
            South African study tying a dramatic decline in HIV
            infection rates to circumcision. But well might you
            think just the opposite if you were apprised of the
            sometimes putrid public health politics underlying
            publication of said study.<br />
            <br />
             The facts seem straightforward on the surface. Some
            3,000 young men &ndash; hardly any married &ndash; were
            selected from a semi-rural area near Johannesburg. Half
            were put in a group that got circumcisions, half in a
            non-circumcised group. After more than a year, 20 of
            the circumcised men had become HIV positive versus 49
            of the uncircumcised men, this even though the
            circumcised men had more sexual encounters.<br />
            <br />
             The scientists were jubilant. "The result is
            equivalent to saying that during the period [of the
            study] the intervention prevented six out of 10
            potential infections," wrote the French and South
            African researchers who conducted the research, adding,
            "this provides a degree of protection against acquiring
            HIV infection equivalent to what a vaccine of high
            efficiency would have achieved."<br />
            <br />
             The finding was so striking, the researchers stopped
            the trial before it was supposed to finish because the
            "protective effect of male circumcision was so high it
            would have been unethical to continue." That is to say,
            they thought there was no doubt that circumcision
            protected against HIV infection.<br />
            <br />
             Finally, the effectiveness of circumcision led the
            scientists to argue that decision makers should
            herewith consider making circumcision of all African
            men a public health priority.<br />
            <br />
             Wonderful, except for all the ethical and
            methodological mud splattered on the findings.<br />
            <br />
             <b>As a background you should know</b> the project
            grew out of more than two decades of observation that
            places in Africa where circumcision was the norm had
            less AIDS than the uncut places. We are not, by the
            way, simply talking about Muslim Africa but also tribes
            where male circumcision is part of a rite of passage
            into adulthood.<br />
            <br />
             While scientists have been able to come up with
            numbers of physical explanations for why what has
            sometimes been snidely called the "cut cure" works,
            nobody has been certain about the connection. This is
            because no previous studies have controlled for
            confounding factors &ndash; age at circumcision, number
            of sexual partners, safe sex practices &ndash; that
            could distort results. So the Johannesburg study was
            vital in translating anecdote and intimation into
            believable science.<br />
            <br />
             However, there was a fundamental ethical problem with
            its methodology. The men were given HIV tests before
            the project began and 146 were found to be HIV
            positive, but &ndash; underline the following in
            lipstick red &ndash; they weren't told about their
            status as researchers "considered it unethical to
            inform participants of their HIV status without their
            permission."<br />
            <br />
             Gasp. You don't tell people with a life-threatening,
            highly infectious disease they are both sick and
            dangerous to others because knowing somehow violates
            their sense of privacy?<br />
            <br />
             To justify this position, French and South African
            scientists involved argued that they were just
            respecting a fear of AIDS stigma so intense that "many
            of these people prefer to be dead than rejected by
            their communities."<br />
            <br />
             Gasp again. This is a public health position so
            obviously crazy &ndash; think in the Canadian context
            of not telling people with SARS they had it because
            they would be stigmatized and quarantined &ndash; it
            led the British journal <i>The Lancet</i> to reject the
            publishing of the AIDS paper on the grounds it was
            ethically flawed.<br />
            <br />
             <b>And there may be a worse confusion to come.</b> Not
            everyone believes the HIV infection numbers in men who
            hadn't been circumcised were so conclusive they
            justified the trial being shut down early. Part of the
            concern was caused by two recent papers that suggest
            that clinical trials claiming huge, big, early effects
            from drugs or other treatments as often as not turn out
            to be statistical blips and not true results.<br />
            <br />
             Could that be the case here?<br />
            <br />
             "My sense is that the circumcision study may have been
            stopped too early and that there is a real danger we
            may be subjecting hundreds of thousands or millions of
            men to having circumcisions that may not have the
            benefit we assume," <a
            href="http://www.intermed.med.uottawa.ca/epid/eng/grimshawbio.html"
             target="_blank">Jeremy Grimshaw</a>, director of the
            Clinical Epidemiology Program at the <a
            href="http://www.uottawa.ca/"
            target="_blank">University of Ottawa</a>, warns me
            about the South African study.<br />
            <br />
             Gasp a third time. So why stop a study when the number
            of people who had become infected wasn't even half as
            large as the number who had the disease to start with
            and weren't told they had it? My guess is a guilty
            conscience. The doctors wanted an excuse to tell all
            the infected of their condition, no matter the
            stigmatization, and the early, positive statistics gave
            them just such an out.<br />
            <br />
             My justification for this charge is that immediately
            after they closed down the trial, the researchers
            changed the rules so they could inform people of their
            disease, even if the people initially said they didn't
            want to know.<br />
            <br />
             Maybe other, still ongoing trials will support the cut
            cure, but for the time being my faith in this one has
            gone snippety, snip, snip.</p>
