            <h2>Death toll rises in circumcision schools</h2>

            <p>December 03, 2007, 14:30</p>

            <p>The death toll in the Eastern Cape's summer
            circumcision season has risen to three. <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/" target="_blank">Health
            Department</a> spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo says an
            18-year-old youth died in the early hours of Sunday
            morning at an illegal initiation school at Gxulu
            village in the Libode area.<br />
            <br />
             He says though the cause is not known, health
            officials suspect dehydration. Following the death, a
            22-year-old unregistered traditional surgeon has been
            arrested and will be appearing in the Libode
            Magistrate&rsquo;s Court later this week.<br />
            <br />
             Two other would-be initiates died last week; one at
            Mthatha General Hospital and the other certified dead
            on arrival at the hospital.<br />
            <br />
             Kupelo says community members apprehended six
            juveniles, one only 14 years old, who were allegedly
            circumcising other boys in the Pondoland area. The six
            have been handed over to police.<br />
            <br />
             He says a team from the Eastern Cape House of
            Traditional Leaders, the provincial health department
            and the police will be in Pondoland this week to talk
            to would-be initiates, communities and parents, in a
            bid to educate them on safe circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             The team is to move to the Port Elizabeth area next
            week. - Sapa</p>
