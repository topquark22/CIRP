      <h2>Circumcision, the unkindest cut</h2>

      <center>
        <b>By DR. GIFFORD-JONES</b> -- Special to C-Health
      </center>

      <p><img src="gifford79.jpg" alt="GIFFORD-JONES" align="left" border="1" hspace="7"
      vspace="3" /> When I researched this column on circumcision,
      my initial reaction was "wow." I thought the topic would be
      as easy to write about as rolling off a log, but it took
      hours. I hadn't realized the male foreskin had triggered so
      many medical articles and so much controversy. Now I'm
      convinced that most families make a decision on circumcision
      without knowing much about this procedure. The question is,
      has male circumcision increased the sale of Viagra?</p>

      <p>For some families the decision is easy. They believe
      circumcision should be performed for religious as well as for
      sound medical reasons. But if that's not the case, what
      should you do? A good start is a lesson on anatomy and its
      sexual implications.</p>

      <p>First, the foreskin doesn't cover just a small surface of
      the penis. The skin removed by circumcision measures from
      three to five inches in length. That's about half of the
      total skin of the penis. Besides, inside the foreskin,
      there's a band of tissue that moves in and out like an
      accordion. This gliding motion triggers sexual reflexes and
      contributes to sexual pleasure.</p>

      <p>So shouldn't sensible babies cry out to parents , "you had
      better think twice before removing such a significant portion
      of my anatomy. And have you ever considered how this will
      affect my sex life?" Some might even add in these litigating
      times, "do it and I'll sue you for a million."</p>

      <p>Due to the recent research of Dr. John Taylor, male babies
      now have even greater grounds for being upset. Taylor is a
      retired pathologist in Winnipeg, Man. In 1996, he and his
      colleagues published a <a
      href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">report</a> describing
      anatomically 21 foreskins in the British Journal Of
      Urology.</p>

      <p>In effect, Taylor claimed medical textbooks of anatomy
      have neglected the foreskin for hundreds of years. In Gray's
      Anatomy, the bible of anatomy, there's just one sentence
      about the foreskin. But Taylor and his colleagues found a "<a
      href="http://research.cirp.org/">ridged band</a>," 1.25
      centimetres (half an inch) in width, that runs around the
      inside tip of the foreskin never before mentioned.</p>

      <p>A detailed microscopic examination of the foreskin
      revealed it's not merely a piece of skin. Rather, it's loaded
      with blood vessels and nerves. Remove it and you also
      amputate a large part of the sexual portion of the penis.
      That in itself should warrant a <a
      href="http://www.intact.ca/class.htm">class action suit</a>
      by millions of males!</p>

      <p>Erectile dysfunction (ER) is due to several causes. But I
      wonder how much Viagra is being sold today because of too
      much snipping of the foreskin?</p>

      <p>So why is circumcision being done? One lame argument
      claims it prevents <a href="/library/disease/cancer/">cancer
      of the penis</a>, an extremely rare problem. But you don't
      amputate breasts to prevent cancer of the breast!</p>

      <p>Studies do show that circumcision decreases the number of
      <a href="/library/disease/UTI/">urinary tract infections</a>
      during the first year of life. But is this a valid reason for
      amputation that may decrease the pleasures of sex for 75
      years?</p>

      <p>What about <a
      href="/library/complications/">complications</a> from the
      procedure? Luckily, they're rare but there have been some
      terribly botched jobs. Some have resulted in severe injuries
      to the penis and urethra (the tube that carries urine through
      the penis). Other babies have suffered from <a
      href="/library/complications#infection">infections</a> and <a
      href="/library/complications#bleeding">hemorrhage</a>.</p>

      <p>So, if you don't have religious views about circumcision,
      what is the best decision? The Canadian Paediatric Society
      believes that <a
      href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm">circumcision
      of newborns should not be a routine procedure</a>.</p>

      <p>The Council on Scientific Affairs of The American Medical
      Association has reached the same <a
      href="/library/statements/ama2000/">conclusion</a>.</p>

      <p>Due to the updated anatomy lesson from Dr. Taylor, saying
      "thanks but no thanks" to circumcision seems to be a logical
      conclusion. Surely, nature put the foreskin there for a valid
      reason and it's rarely prudent to disagree with nature.</p>

      <p>As Dr. Taylor remarks, "The value of the actual foreskin
      is often put at zero. But parents should put a value on it
      because it's a structure in its own right."</p>

      <p>I'm sure some readers will argue, "I've enjoyed good sex
      for years and I was circumcised." Maybe so, but they could
      also be living in a fool's paradise. Have they considered how
      much <a href="/library/sex_function/">better sex</a> would
      have been without the snipping!</p>

      <p>And what about the babies' pain? I've heard too many
      screaming babies not to know it's a painful procedure. As Dr.
      Margaret Somerville, a lawyer and ethicist at <a
      href="http://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a> says,
      "People have a fundamental human right not to have pain
      intentionally inflicted on them." Shouldn't that human right
      include babies?</p>
