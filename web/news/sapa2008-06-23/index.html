             An 18-year-old youth died on Sunday due to an
            infection he sustained during a circumcision ceremony
            in Butterworth, <a href="http://www.ecdoh.gov.za/"
            target="_blank">Eastern Cape</a> police said.<br />
            <br />
             "The boy, who is from Ibika Township went to an
            initiation school a few weeks ago," said Captain
            Lingisile Magama.<br />
            <br />
             <span class="yellow">Magama said the boy's genitals
            had been severely mutilated and a nurse hired to look
            after him had not taken proper care of his
            wounds.<br />
            <br />
             "It became severely infected and led to the death of
            the boy," Magama said.</span><br />
            <br />
             The nurse and the person responsible for conducting
            the circumcision ceremony were taken in for
            questioning. An inquest into the boy's death would be
            conducted.<br />
            <br />
             In a separate incident the body of a 33-year-old man
            was found dumped in a ditch near a river in Butterworth
            on Sunday.<br />
            <br />
             "The man was found by a passer-by at 3pm. He sustained
            multiple stab wounds all over his body," Magama
            said.<br />
            <br />
             Police were investigating the man's death. He had not
            been identified yet. Anyone with information regarding
            the murder was asked to call 047 489 12 10.<br />
