            <h2>Stunned community unites in grief after boy
            dies</h2>

            <p>By Neans McSweeney</p>

            <p>MEMBERS of the Nigerian community filed in and out of
            Idehen and Mabel Osaghae's rented townhouse on a hill
            overlooking Waterford's quays yesterday afternoon,
            trying to console them after their son's death. Stunned
            neighbours remained indoors as word of the death of
            29-day-old Callis, after a botched circumcision, spread
            across the city.</p>

            <p>The infant was rushed to Waterford Regional Hospital
            on Sunday night but died after losing a large amount of
            blood. It is not yet clear if the procedure took place
            in his own home, or elsewhere in the city.</p>

            <p>None of the neighbouring families in Summerhill Mews
            were willing to talk yesterday. And while there was
            light inside the family's home, and hushed voices could
            be heard inside, the family did not wish to talk
            either.</p>

            <p>"We've just been in to see the family. Mabel is very
            upset and she doesn't want to talk," said one Nigerian
            man who had been visiting the bereaved family. We've
            been trying to get her to talk but she doesn't want to.
            She has one of her daughters with her. We stayed with
            her, talked to her and prayed for a little while. We
            will come back later on to see if she wants to talk
            then," the man said.</p>

            <p>One neighbour on the main street said there's never
            been any trouble, noise or disturbance in the area.
            "There are all kinds of nationalities in there. And
            when the apartments across the road here are finished,
            we'll have even more. It's a grand, quiet part of the
            city," he added.</p>

            <p>The mood in Waterford yesterday afternoon was one of
            stunned silence. People were sympathetic towards the
            family and touched by the death of such a young boy.
            There were also appeals for understanding from
            anti-racism groups.</p>

            <p>Roy Hassey, of Waterford Against Racism, described
            the death as a tragedy and appealed to people to
            respect the religious beliefs of the family grieving
            their son's death.</p>

            <p>"Whether people agree to it or not, circumcision is
            part of the Nigerian community's religious beliefs.
            Everyone has different beliefs. We have to respect
            people's cultures and beliefs, just as they respect
            ours," he said.</p>

            <p>The Nigerian community in Waterford and elsewhere is
            already on edge, he said, because of the constant fear
            and threat of deportation. "A lot of Nigerians are
            worried and they feel particularly victimised. The vast
            majority won't get asylum here. They feel they are
            being singled out for deportation a lot of the
            time.</p>

            <p>"There are about 300 asylum-seekers in Waterford
            city and around 30% are Nigerian. They will be upset by
            this tragedy and will unite to try to help the family
            through it," he said.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.icgp.ie/"
            target="_blank">Irish College of General
            Practitioners</a> also says the tragedy shows the clear
            need for better medical services for non-nationals in
            our community, particularly non-emergency
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>Dr Philip Crowley, who is project director for the
            ICGP's General Practice in a Multicultural Society,
            said the need for a better service in Waterford has
            been highlighted over the past months.</p>

            <p>"People would be less likely to have these
            procedures done in their home, were there a service
            available to them in the community. Under the teaching
            of Islam, it is not uncommon for a boy this young to be
            circumcised. It would not happen, except for medical
            reasons, to a child this young in Irish culture. A
            circumcision service in non-medical cases is available
            in many parts of the country but not in Waterford."</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.sehb.ie/"
            target="_blank">South Eastern Health Board</a> said
            there is a service at Waterford Regional Hospital, but
            only on medical grounds.</p>
