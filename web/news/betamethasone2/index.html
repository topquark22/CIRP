      <h2>Betamethasone is safe, efficacious, and economical
      treatment for phimosis.</h2>
      Aug 14 (Reuters Health) - Treatment with topical
      betamethasone appears to be a safe, economical and
      efficacious alternative to surgery in the treatment of
      phimosis. 

      <p>Dr. Anna Orsola, of Harvard Medical School, Boston,
      Massachusetts, and colleagues in Spain <a
      href="/library/treatment/phimosis/orsola1/">report in the
      August issue of Urology</a> that 6 months after treatment
      with topical steroids, 90% of 137 boys with phimosis "had an
      easily retractable prepuce without a phimotic ring" at 6
      months after therapy. Treatment was well tolerated and
      consisted of application of 0.05% betamethasone cream twice
      daily for 1 month.</p>

      <p>"Of importance, we did not find statistically significant
      differences in the response rate when stratifying the
      patients on the basis of age or type of phimosis at
      presentation," Dr. Orsola and colleagues write. "Moreover, we
      showed for the first time that the treatment is equally
      beneficial when a previous history of forcible foreskin
      retractions (secondary phimosis) is present."</p>

      <p>The researchers found that "all the patients with
      persistent or recurrent phimosis were found to be
      noncompliant with the suggested daily foreskin care." They
      explain that "after the fifth day of treatment, [patients
      and/or their parents] were asked to gently retract the
      foreskin several times after applying the cream. They were
      also encouraged to retract the foreskin when they voided and
      during their daily bath." The boys were 13 months to 14 years
      old.</p>

      <p>The team suspects that the efficacy of betamethasone in
      boys with phimosis is a consequence of its anti-inflammatory
      properties.</p>
