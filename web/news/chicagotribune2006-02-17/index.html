            <h2>Circumcision decision delayed by court</h2>

            <p><b>By Judy Peres</b><br />
             Tribune staff reporter<br />
             <i>Published February 17, 2006, 7:55 PM CST</i></p>

            <p>A Cook County judge Friday ordered a mother not to
            circumcise her 8-year-old son until the court can hear
            arguments from the child's father, who opposes the
            operation, and decide whether it is in the boy's best
            interests.</p>

            <p>The mother, a 31-year-old homemaker from Northbrook,
            says two doctors have recommended the procedure to
            prevent recurrent infections. Her ex-husband, a
            49-year-old building manager who lives in Arlington
            Heights, calls the operation an "unnecessary
            amputation" that could cause his son physical and
            emotional harm.</p>

            <p>The Tribune is not naming the parents to protect the
            child's privacy.</p>

            <p>Circumcision, in which the foreskin of the penis is
            surgically removed, usually before a newborn leaves the
            hospital, was extremely common in the U.S. during the
            last century. But the percentage of U.S. babies being
            circumcised has gone down from an estimated 90 percent
            in 1970 to some 60 percent today.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.aap.org"
            target="_blank">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> no
            longer recommends routine neonatal circumcision but
            says the decision should be left up to the parents.</p>

            <p>In recent years, the procedure has come under fire
            from a small but vocal group who believe it is the
            equivalent of female genital mutilation. They argue, in
            an increasing number of legal challenges, that the
            procedure is medically unnecessary and morally
            indefensible.</p>

            <p>There are no published U.S. opinions to serve as
            precedents for the current case, and legal experts said
            it likely would be determined based on the best
            interests of the child.</p>

            <p>Both sides appeared Friday in <a
            href="http://www.cookcountycourt.org/"
            target="_blank">Cook County Circuit Court</a>, where
            the father asked Judge Jordan Kaplan for a temporary
            restraining order against his ex-wife. His attorneys,
            John D'Arco and <a
            href="http://homepage.interaccess.com/~dbyavitz/"
            target="_blank">Alan Toback</a>, argued that the
            couple's divorce agreement provided that the father had
            to be consulted before any non-emergency medical
            care.</p>

            <p>Kaplan got the two sides to agree that the child
            would not be circumcised "until further order of [the]
            court." He also ordered them not to discuss the case
            with their child.</p>

            <p>The mother's attorney, Tracy Rizzo, said the father
            had scared the child by telling him horror stories
            about what can happen to boys who are circumcised.</p>

            <p>According to Dr. Irwin Benuck, a pediatrician at <a
            href="http://www.childrensmemorial.org/"
            target="_blank">Children's Memorial Hospital</a>, and
            Dr. Clare Close, a pediatric urologist at the <a
            href="http://www.uchospitals.edu/">University of
            Chicago Hospitals</a>, circumcision is an outpatient
            procedure and any discomfort is usually gone in less
            then a week.</p>

            <p>"Complications are pretty rare," said Benuck.</p>

            <p><a href="/news/1999.11.26_Guardian/">In England, a
            Muslim father in 1999 lost his battle to have his
            5-year-old son circumcised against the wishes of the
            mother, with whom the child lives</a>. (Jews and
            Muslims circumcise their sons for religious reasons.)
            <a href="/library/legal/Re_J/2000.html">A judge ruled
            that circumcision was not in the child's interests and
            might traumatize him.</a></p>
