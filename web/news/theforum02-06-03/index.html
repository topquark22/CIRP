            <p>The Forum - 02/06/2003</p>

            <p>Attorney <a href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a> had unsuccessfully
            requested the jury hearing his client&rsquo;s case be
            shown video and photos of circumcision. He said the
            pictures were worth a thousand words.</p>

            <p>So, Wednesday, Baer used all 1,000 words and more as
            he had one of his witnesses describe every detail of
            the <a
            href="http://www.aafp.org/afp/980915ap/peleg.html"
            target="_blank">circumcision process</a>.</p>

            <p>East Central District Court <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/Rothe-Seeger.htm"
            target="_blank">Judge Cynthia Rothe-Seeger</a> has
            ruled Baer can&rsquo;t use videos of circumcision,
            tools used in the procedure and pictures of
            uncircumcised penises in his client&rsquo;s case
            against <a href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Hospital</a> and one of its
            doctors because they are not relevant to the
            lawsuit.</p>

            <p>Rothe-Seeger also ruled Wednesday Baer&rsquo;s
            expert witness, <a
            href="http://www.marshfieldclinic.org/provider/detail.asp?ID=32941"
            target="_blank">Dr. Christopher Cold</a> of <a
            href="http://ci.marshfield.wi.us/"
            target="_blank">Marshfield</a>, Wis., couldn&rsquo;t
            use a slide presentation that shows the anatomy of a
            penis.</p>

            <p>So, using a magic marker to draw pictures, Cold and
            Baer launched into nearly three hours of testimony
            describing penile anatomy, circumcision and the tools
            involved to do it.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;It may be uncomfortable to look at these
            areas, but it is something that is important to
            know,&rdquo; Cold told the jury at the start of his
            testimony.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.zbaer.com/anita.htm"
            target="_blank">Anita Flatt</a> of <a
            href="http://www.hawley.govoffice.com/"
            target="_blank">Hawley</a>, Minn., is suing <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734"
            target="_blank">Dr. Sunita Kantak</a>, <a
            href="http://www.ci.fargo.nd.us/default.asp"
            target="_blank">Fargo</a>-based <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Hospital</a> and the state of
            <a href="http://www.discovernd.com/"
            target="_blank">North Dakota</a>, claiming she and her
            husband, James, weren&rsquo;t told complete and
            accurate information about removing the foreskin from
            their son&rsquo;s penis.</p>

            <p>Anita Flatt, now an attorney at Baer&rsquo;s <a
            href="http://www.zbaer.com/" target="_blank">law
            firm</a>, signed a circumcision consent form, but
            hospital staff didn&rsquo;t describe the benefits or
            risks of the procedure, the lawsuit says.</p>

            <p>She wouldn&rsquo;t have consented to the procedure
            had she known what it entailed, Flatt said.</p>

            <p>She is asking for an unspecified amount in
            damages.</p>

            <p>Cold, an anatomic pathologist, talked Wednesday
            about how circumcision has become an engrained part of
            American culture though it serves no necessary medical
            purpose.</p>

            <p>He told the jury circumcision is <a
            href="/library/procedure/mansfield/">lucrative for
            hospitals</a> because it is a relatively minor
            procedure.</p>

            <p>He also said because the foreskin contains many
            nerves, its removal is painful, even with anesthetic,
            and the effects of diminished sexual sensation will
            last throughout the child&rsquo;s life.</p>

            <p>Baer will bring Cold to the stand again today.</p>

            <p>Attorneys spent Wednesday morning presenting their
            opening statements to the jury.</p>

            <p>Baer told the jury that just because Flatt signed a
            consent form doesn&rsquo;t mean the hospital and doctor
            fulfilled their duty of informing Flatt of the risks
            and benefits involved in circumcision.</p>

            <p>He said the defense will rely on MeritCare&rsquo;s
            records and procedure to prove they did nothing
            wrong.</p>

            <p>He then laid out examples of record and procedure
            omissions.</p>

            <p>Baer also said his client was not given a required
            booklet on circumcision and only met with Dr. Kantak
            briefly before the procedure.</p>

            <p>MeritCare attorney <a
            href="http://www.vogellaw.com/fsl5cs/XMLAttorneyProfile.asp?guid=I1D0AB9301DD211B28BAB4D00E205CACF&amp;ind_wld_id=1286278"
             target="_blank">Jane Voglewede</a> said the case is
            about a husband and wife that decided to have their son
            circumcised, and a hospital that respected their
            wishes.</p>

            <p>She told the jury there is no expert testimony that
            shows anything went wrong with the procedure - a claim
            Flatt contests - and that all required steps were taken
            in informing the Flatt&rsquo;s.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;(Anita) is a lawyer,&rdquo; Voglewede told
            the jury of six women and four men. &ldquo;She was a
            lawyer at that time, and she understood what a consent
            form was.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>She told the jury to pay attention to the
            qualifications of the plaintiff&rsquo;s witnesses
            &ldquo;or the lack of.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>None of them are qualified to perform circumcisions,
            she said.</p>

            <p>Voglewede ended her opening statement by saying
            Flatt&rsquo;s son was born a healthy baby and still is
            a healthy boy.</p>

            <p>The trial, which opened Monday, is expected to last
            two weeks.</p>
