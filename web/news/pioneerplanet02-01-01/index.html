    <blockquote>
      <h2>Restoring what's missing</h2>
      Greg Beirise has never quite forgiven doctors for
      circumcising him 32 years ago, nor his parents for requesting
      the procedure. 

      <p>``It always bothered me,'' said Beirise, a Web page
      developer from Chicago. ``I just wanted to be whole.''</p>

      <p>Beirise is one of thousands of men in the United States
      and other countries who are trying to take back what is cut
      away at birth.</p>

      <p>Brought together mainly over the Internet, these men are
      young, retired, straight, gay, blue collar, professional, Jew
      and gentile. They say they are growing back their foreskins,
      transforming themselves from circumcised to near natural for
      better sex, general comfort and emotional ``healing.''</p>

      <p>Beirise's goal is to grow back skin that resembles his
      lost foreskin. To do so, he has worn a pair of men's
      tall-size suspenders under his pants for the past 4 1/2
      years. The suspenders are attached to various devices that
      gently stretch the skin on his penis.</p>

      <p>Dr. William Reiner, a psychiatrist and urologist at <a
      href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/medicalschool/"
      target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University School of
      Medicine</a>, says men like Beirise won't likely do
      themselves any harm, so long as they avoid cutting off their
      blood supply, piercing their skin or causing themselves any
      pain.</p>

      <p>The extent to which the skin grows back depends upon how
      much was cut away in the first place, experts say. They also
      say the new skin may not have the same sensitivity as the
      original.</p>

      <p>But Reiner says that may not matter to some -- thousands,
      even.</p>

      <p>R. Wayne Griffiths, a California construction engineer,
      says as many as 7,000 men of all descriptions have contacted
      him online or on the telephone about restoration. He leads
      the <a href="http://www.norm.org/" target="_blank">National
      Organization for Restoring Men</a>, or NORM, a group that has
      chapters in 20 states and six countries.</p>

      <p>Those interested now buy books written on the topic -- the
      most popular, ``The Joy of Uncircumcising,'' is on back order
      at <b>Amazon.com</b>. Some 13,000 copies have been sold so
      far.</p>

      <p>They also buy equipment designed for the purpose,
      including the wares of retired motorcycle dealer Roland Clark
      of Huntington Beach, Calif., who sells three patented
      products online for as much as $450 apiece.</p>

      <p>They say many people don't understand why they do it.
      ``Knowledge is the key,'' said Leo Freyer, a retired
      draftsman in Spokane, Wash. ``They just don't know what
      they're missing.''</p>
