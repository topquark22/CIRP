            <small><i>Report by Michael Quinn</i></small></p>

            <p><big>A</big> Nigerian asylum seeker, charged with
            performing a circumcision with a razor blade which lead
            to <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/onlineie08-20-03/">the
            death of a 29-day-old boy in Waterford city last
            August</a>, was granted bail in <a
            href="http://www.courts.ie/theCourt.nsf/(CourtOfficeLookup)/Waterford+Circuit+Court+Office"
            target="_blank">Waterford Circuit Court</a> on
            Wednesday.</p>

            <p>The charge against the accused man, <b>Osagie
            Ighinedion</b>, Ormonde House, John's Green, Kilkenny,
            was adjourned to the next sessions when Mr. Tom Teehan,
            BL., instructed by Mr. Frank Hutchinson, State Solr.,
            for the DPP, said the case was not ready to proceed
            because technical tests sent to the UK had not yet been
            returned. The tests were an essential part of the State
            case.</p>

            <p>Judge Ml. O'Shea said he was satisfied the State was
            awaiting technical evidence and agreed to adjourn the
            case to next sessions.</p>

            <p>The accused is charged with intentionally or
            recklessly performing the circumcision on an infant,
            Callis Osaghae, at Summerhill Mews, Waterford, on
            August 17, 2003, with a razor blade which created
            substantial risk of death or serious harm.</p>

            <p>Applying for bail, Mr. John O'Kelly SC., instructed
            by Mr. Brian Chesser, solr., for the accused man, said
            his client had no previous convictions and he had been
            in prison since last September. He was in a dreadful
            situation and finding it extremely difficult in prison
            as he was being subjected to stigma and abuse by other
            prisoners. <span class="yellow">He was being called a
            `baby killer'.</span> Since coming to Ireland, he
            formed a close relationship with an Irish woman and,
            prior to his arrest, he did not run away.</p>

            <p><b>Not illegal in Nigeria</b><br />
            Mr. O'Kelly said the accused carried out something
            which was not illegal in his own country, Nigeria, and
            things appeared to have gone very wrong. He was the son
            of a local Judge in Nigeria and <span class="yellow">a
            fourth generation cicumcisionist.</span> He did it as a
            favour for another member of the Nigerian community in
            Ireland.</p>

            <p>Mr. Teehan said the Gardai would not oppose bail on
            condition that the accused man signed on daily at
            Kilkenny Garda Station and stayed at a nominated
            address at 31, Millenium Court, Kilkenny, and notified
            the Gardai of any change of address. Other conditions
            of bail should be that he handed in his passport,
            undertook not to carry out any further circumcisions
            and not make contact with the witneses named the in the
            Book of Evidence or those disclosed by the prosecution.
            A substantial independent surety was also being
            sought.</p>

            <p>Mr. O'Kelly said that, apart from the independent
            surety, his client would have no difficulty with the
            other conditions of bail. He had no passport and his
            girl friend would put up &euro;1,000 cash bail but, due
            to the fact he had been in prison, his own resources
            were exhausted. Granting bail subject to the
            conditions, Judge O'Shea warned the accused not to
            leave the jurisdiction until the case was
            concluded.</p>
