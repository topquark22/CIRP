            <h2>Mother of dead initiate barred from funeral</h2>

            <p>June 28 2002 at 07:12PM</p>

            <p>By Baldwin Ndaba</p>

            <p>In a bizarre twist, the mother of Amos Jabu
            Mkhwanazi, the first of five initiates to die at a
            Heidelberg initiation [circumcision] school, was on
            Friday barred from the funeral of her son because she
            had never been through initiation school herself.</p>

            <p>Mkhwanazi, 25, was among initiates who were
            allegedly beaten to death by the school leader in the
            hills on Nooitgedacht farm, outside Heidelberg. It is
            alleged that he tried to escape and was captured on
            Monday and returned to the school where he was ordered
            to strip naked.</p>

            <p>Cold water was poured over him and he was allegedly
            lashed 462 times. He died from his injuries.</p>

            <p>His mother Josephine Mkhwanazi, 62, said: "An
            inyanga, Alina Sekhoto, came to our house a few days
            after Jabu's death and told us to quickly bury our son.
            I just followed the instruction. The first thing I did
            this morning after I woke up was to go to Zenzele
            Funeral Undertakers to wash my child and wrap his
            battered body with a blanket," said Mkhwanazi said.</p>

            <p>Only Jabu's father Paly Mkhwanazi, 70, brother
            Mphume and his father-in-law Johannes Mofokeng and
            eight initiates, who had been at winter bush school
            with Jabu, attended the funeral at New Heidelberg
            Cemetery.</p>

            <p>Jabu was buried in plot number D191. There were no
            wreaths or flowers, just a covering of earth.</p>

            <p>When the <i>Saturday Star</i> visited the family on
            Friday they had just arrived home from the funeral and
            were still in a state of shock.</p>

            <p>"You know, those people are brutal. The body of my
            child was in a very bad state. They hacked his head,
            his ears were also cut and his body was completely
            battered, cut all over," Mrs Mkhwanazi said.</p>

            <p>"It appeared as though his attackers used a sjambok
            or stick. Those people are very cruel. My child died a
            cruel death. It will take time to forget this."</p>

            <p>David Cosmos Dladla was arrested and has been
            charged with Jabu's murder. His case has been postponed
            to July 3.</p>

            <p>Jabu worked for an Alberton building supply company.
            He is survived by his wife Anna and one-year-old twins
            Lebo and Lebohang.</p>
