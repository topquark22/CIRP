      <h2>Is circumcision in males necessary?</h2>

      <p class="author"><b>By Reynaldo O. Joson, M.D. Of The
      Charter Bureau</b></p>

      <p>Part I</p>

      <p>Until recently, no one&mdash;including doctors&mdash;ever
      bothered to take a closer look at this issue. We always
      thought it was a long-answered question and that it was
      really medically necessary to have all males circumcised. But
      is it?</p>

      <p>Circumcision in males usually consists of removing part of
      the prepuce or foreskin of the penis. Its practice has
      various origins, both religious and non-religious, medical
      and non-medical. The reasons for the practice of circumcision
      in males have evolved from Biblical practice.</p>

      <p>There is still the religious basis, especially for the
      Jews and Muslims (but this is not absolute anymore because
      there are now Jews and Muslims who object to male
      circumcision).</p>

      <p>There is still the medical basis, particularly, in the
      belief that circumcision can prevent urinary tract infection,
      penile and cervical cancer, and sexually transmitted
      diseases. The sexual arguments for circumcision is based on
      the belief that circumcision offers more sexual enjoyment to
      both male and female partners.</p>

      <p>However, the predominant driving forces for circumcision
      in males are tradition and peer pressure. Male newborns are
      circumcised because of the parent's belief of the traditional
      practice. Male adolescents and even adults are also
      circumcised because of the traditional need ("passage rite to
      manhood") and peer pressure (afraid to be teased as
      "supot").</p>

      <p>An objective, scientific, and dispassionate look is
      therefore necessary to answer the question: Is circumcision
      in males really necessary?</p>

      <p>On the basis of medical reasons, routine circumcision in
      males is NOT necessary. The American Academy of Pediatrics
      has done extensive critical analysis of all published papers
      on the topic and has come out with a <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">stand</a> in 1999 that
      routine circumcision in males is not necessary.</p>

      <p>On the issue of urinary tract infection, penile and
      cervical cancers, circumcision may have a potential benefit
      in terms of prevention but its actual value is minimal
      because of the low occurrence of these dreaded consequences.
      In other words, the risk is extremely low if circumcision is
      not done and thus, routine circumcision is not warranted.</p>

      <p>On the issue of sexually transmitted diseases, prevention
      should focus on the behavioral factors&mdash;that is,
      avoiding promiscuity and careless sex&mdash;rather than
      relying on circumcision. On the question of hygiene,
      promotion can be done with meticulous mechanical cleansing
      without having to resort to the invasive and painful
      procedure of circumcision.</p>

      <p>The most common and most clear cut medical indication for
      male circumcision is now limited to patients with urinary
      infection secondary to phimosis (extremely small opening of
      the prepuce or foreskin of the penis).</p>

      <p>Paraphimosis (tightness of the foreskin that tends to
      strangle the penis) can be another medical indication if it
      occurs. Other than these situations, medical-wise,
      circumcision in males is not necessary.</p>

      <p>In the Philippines, the Christian religions do not require
      routine circumcision anymore. For the Muslims and Jews, it
      may still be advocated but it is no longer an absolute
      requirement. There are even websites put up by Jewish and
      Muslim authors crusading against circumcision.</p>

      <p>To be continued.</p>

      <p>Part II</p>

      <p>The debatable issue on sexual enjoyment may be a myth
      after all. Although there are no conclusive findings yet, a
      most recent <a href="/library/anatomy/ohara/">scientific
      article</a> on the issue shows that more sexual enjoyment is
      felt by the female partners with non-circumcised than with
      circumcised men. The enjoyment is scientifically validated in
      terms of more copious vaginal secretion, less vaginal
      discomfort, and more frequent vaginal orgasm&mdash;multiple
      at that.</p>

      <p>In countries like the Philippines, the predominant driving
      forces for circumcision in males at present are tradition and
      peer pressure. Though the traditional factor may be religious
      in origin, in the Philippines (at least for the Christians),
      it is usually non-religious in nature and now more related
      with social customs and practices.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, the traditional factor is usually vague in
      the sense that the parents and the male children are not able
      to pinpoint the exact reason for wanting a circumcision to be
      done. Peer pressure in the Philippines is strong and consists
      of the male children afraid to be teased of being "supot".
      Traditional practices and peer pressure are really had to go
      against.</p>

      <p>If we are not obliged by religious reasons and if we are
      now convinced that circumcision is not needed for medical
      reasons, the question is&mdash;How do we go against the tide
      of tradition and peer pressure to reverse the present of
      routine circumcision? That is the challenge being presented
      to those who think that the male Filipino children should be
      saved from the physical pain of unnecessary circumcision.</p>

      <p>I have an adolescent son who asked me last year if he
      needed to be circumcised. I emphatically said "No!"</p>

      <p>I told him it is not needed and it is painful. I
      emphasized to him not to be carried away by the teasing of
      "supot" and not to be overpowered by peer pressure. I even
      taught him how to counter the teasing of "supot" by saying
      uncircumcised men are intact, unaltered and preferred by
      women in terms of sexual enjoyment and comfort and that
      circumcised men are altered and not original. Up to now, he
      has remained to be uncircumcised.</p>

      <p>As a surgeon, during the past 20 years, I have convinced
      quite a number adolescent males who came to my clinic not to
      have circumcision anymore. Those who are convinced are happy
      and thankful to me. Those who are not convinced seek other
      surgeons to do the circumcision for them.</p>
