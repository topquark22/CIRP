      <h2>Botched circumcisions send four boys to hospital in
      Kuopio</h2>
      <b>Authorities investigate aftermath of operations by
      visiting Muslim doctor</b> 

      <p>Four Muslim boys have been hospitalised in the eastern
      city of Kuopio for complications resulting from
      circumcisions.</p>

      <p>One of the boys had gangrene in his penis, but it
      apparently was successfully treated in hospital.</p>

      <p>An African-born doctor visiting Kuopio last week performed
      the operation on seven Muslim boys. The youngest was just
      three months old, and the oldest were about ten.</p>

      <p>The first of the boys were brought to the hospital on
      Wednesday night last week.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.kuh.fi/2_index.htm">Kuopio
      University Hospital</a> and public health clinics do not
      perform male circumcisions except for medical reasons.</p>

      <p><b>Female circumcision,</b> also known as female genital
      mutilation, is practised in a number of areas in North
      Africa. The procedure is illegal in Finland and is prosecuted
      as an assault.</p>

      <p>The Provincial Government of Eastern Finland is
      investigating the events of recent days.</p>

      <p>"At this point we are ascertaining what kind of a doctor
      was at work, if he has a right to practice medicine, and in
      what kinds of conditions it has taken place", says Provincial
      doctor <b>Antti Turunen</b>.</p>

      <p>"Fortunately the patients are being treated and nothing
      worse happened. However, this is already pretty bad."</p>

      <p>If the case is found to involve serious negligence, the
      matter will be dealt with by the National Authority for
      Medicolegal Affairs (TEO). According to director-general
      <b>Eila Uotila</b>, the professional skill of a doctor can be
      reviewed if his or her patient suffers more complications
      than normal.</p>

      <p><b>In a ruling issued in 1999</b> the Deputy <a
      href="http://www.eduskunta.fi/efakta/eoa/eoa.htm">Parliamentary
      Ombudsman</a> <b>Riitta-Leena Paunio</b> said that Finnish
      public health institutions are not obliged to perform male
      circumcisions for non-medical reasons.</p>

      <p>Paunio said that a cautious view should be taken on male
      circumcision, even though the right to practice religion
      should be respected.</p>

      <p>Different hospitals have different policies concerning
      circumcision for non-medical reasons.</p>

      <p>The university hospitals in Helsinki and Kuopio do not
      perform religious circumcisions. At the <a
      href="http://www.randburg.com/fi/ouluhosp.html">Oulu
      University Hospital</a>, about half a dozen such procedures
      are performed each year.</p>

      <p>The university hospitals of Tampere and Turku stopped
      performing religious circumcisions after the Deputy
      Parliamentary Ombudsman's decision.</p>
