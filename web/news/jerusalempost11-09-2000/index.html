            <p>By Heidi J. Gleit</p>

            <p>(November 9) - The Kfar Sava Magistrate's Court
            yesterday released a Ramat Aviv doctor on bail and did
            not bar him from continuing to circumcise infants, even
            though police are investigating complaints from half a
            dozen parents that he had maimed their newborn
            sons.</p>

            <p>("I have no doubt of the need to investigate these
            complaints, and additional ones if they are filed... I
            did not find reason to grant the plaintiff's additional
            request to bar the suspect from performing the
            circumcision he was invited to perform today," Judge
            Clara Reginiano ruled.</p>

            <p>(The Central District's fraud squad has received
            complaints from six families in the center of the
            country who had hired the doctor to circumcise their
            newborn sons. He is a general practitioner and had
            advertised himself as a licensed mohel. However, his
            name does not appear on the Chief Rabbinate's list of
            mohelim.</p>

            <p>(The suspect acknowledged that he does not have
            authorization from the rabbinate, but denied that he
            had committed any offense.</p>

            <p>(Police began investigating him two weeks ago when
            the first complaint was filed, police spokeswoman
            Ch.-Supt. Sivan Kedmi said. The parents said they
            engaged the suspect after seeing an advertisement of
            his in a hospital. <span class="yellow">Their baby had
            continued to bleed for nearly a week after the
            circumcision.</span> When they took the child in for an
            examination, they learned that he had not been properly
            circumcised and had to undergo an operation to correct
            the damage.</p>

            <p>(Several other families who had had similar
            experiences filed complaints after hearing of the
            investigation.</p>
