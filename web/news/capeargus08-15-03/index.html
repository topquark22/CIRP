             Posted to the web August 15, 2003<br />

            <p>By Di Caelers</p>

            <p>A registry of circumcision schools, proper training
            and certification, and inspections of bush circumcision
            sites would address "the barbarism perpetrated on
            today's hapless youth".</p>

            <p>That's the call from the editor of the <a
            href="http://www.inasp.org.uk/ajol/journals/sam/index.htm"
             target="_blank">SA Medical Journal</a>, Professor Dan
            Ncayiyana, who says the "barbarism" of the circumcision
            ritual today has little in common with the principles
            of this ancient rite.</p>

            <p>Writing in the latest edition of the journal,
            Ncayiyana comments on a study from the Bolopedu
            district in Limpopo that concluded the modern-day
            circumcision ritual had "degenerated into a
            money-making operation".</p>

            <p>People paid as much as R400 a boy for
            attendance.</p>

            <p>Even worse, the research says, because more boys
            were having clinical circumcisions, "the school leaders
            have resorted to ... abducting males to these
            schools".</p>

            <p>Deaths from ritual circumcision mostly happened in
            impoverished rural and peri-urban communities.</p>

            <p>The ancient rite used to be about preparing
            youngsters for manhood.</p>

            <p>Calling many "circumcision schools" fakes - and
            deadly - Ncayiyana said three interventions could save
            many lives:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Establishment of a registry of circumcision
              schools, and a requirement that they be
              registered.</li>

              <li>Training and certification of those conducting
              circumcisions.</li>

              <li>Bush circumcision venues must pass
              inspection.</li>
            </ul>
          </td>
        </tr>
