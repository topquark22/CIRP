            <h2>Another victim of circumcision ritual</h2>
            <i>18 July 2008, 18:11</i> 

            <p>Aware of the risks of traditional circumcision, the
            family of 18-year old Yongama Boya had him circumcised
            in hospital before sending him off to the "bush" to
            complete the rest of his initiation ritual.<br />
            <br />
             But even that did not save him.<br />
            <br />
             Last week, his uncle found the boy in a coma in one of
            the grass-and-stick shelters at an initiation school in
            the Qumbu area of Transkei.<br />
            <br />
             And though he ordered water to be warmed, and tried to
            give it to Yongama to drink, his nephew died before his
            eyes, without regaining consciousness.<br />
            <br />
             The Mthatha district surgeon who conducted the
            post-mortem examination listed the immediate cause of
            death as "consistent with hypothermia".<br />
            <br />
             In the section on the official form for "conditions
            leading to immediate cause", he wrote: "pulmonary
            oedema".<br />
            <br />
             In layman's terms, Yongama had pneumonia, and died of
            exposure.<br />
            <br />
             According to death certificate number B7117961 issued
            on Friday (July 18) by the department of home affairs,
            Yongama died of "unnatural causes".<br />
            <br />
             He was victim number 22 of this year's winter-season
            crop of Eastern Cape circumcision deaths: deaths that
            occur year after year, despite the strenuous efforts of
            provincial health authorities to stop them.<br />
            <br />
             The causes of those deaths are for the most part
            roughly evenly split between sepsis, resulting from
            infected wounds, and dehydration, thanks to the notion
            that initiates should not drink water for an extended
            period.<br />
            <br />
             And every year, scores more would-be initiates are
            admitted to hospital for treatment for problems arising
            from botched circumcisions, that in the worst cases
            lead to gangrene and the amputation of the entire
            penis.<br />
            <br />
             Yongama was a Grade 11 pupil at Riverside High School
            in Mthatha, and, according to his elder brother Mtsasa,
            was a good-natured, helpful youth.<br />
            <br />
             "He was a quiet, good boy," Mtsasa said. "He was a
            twin, but his twin passed away when they were young,
            nine months.<br />
            <br />
             "He was a leader in his group, always attending
            church. He used even to help people around the
            location, repairing fridges and radios and all that
            stuff. He was good."<br />
            <br />
             Yongama turned 18 - the legal minimum age for
            traditional circumcision in the Eastern Cape - on May
            15.<br />
            <br />
             Mtsasa said that, well aware of the hazards of
            traditional circumcision, the family decided Yongama
            should be circumcised hygienically and safely in
            hospital, by a doctor.<br />
            <br />
             He himself had followed this route, he said.<br />
            <br />
             Yongama's circumcision was accordingly done in
            hospital during the Easter school holiday.<br />
            <br />
             On June 21 he joined a group of 23 other Hlubi youths
            at an initiation school in the bush in the Ethwa
            Location in the Qumbu area.<br />
            <br />
             According to Mtsasa, when the time came for the actual
            circumcision ceremony, the traditional surgeon saw that
            Yongama had already been circumcised, and declared,
            correctly, that he could not re-circumcise him.<br />
            <br />
             Pressured by the leader of the three traditional
            nurses, or iikhankatha, at the school, the surgeon said
            he risked losing his registration with the provincial
            health department if he cut the youth again.<br />
            <br />
             When he persisted in his refusal, the nurse began
            beating the surgeon and he ran away.<br />
            <br />
             "Then the ikhankatha said, come here, I'm going to
            circumcise him again, and he circumcised him in front
            of the other people," Mtsasa said.<br />
            <br />
             After the ceremony, the youths were made to sleep on
            bare ground under shelters of sticks and grass, even
            though it was rainy and cold, he said.<br />
            <br />
             "We had bought him a blanket so he could be
            comfortable," Mtsasa said. "They took away the blanket.
            He was beaten and not given water or food, I'm
            told."<br />
            <br />
             In the weeks that followed, Yongama's condition
            worsened.<br />
            <br />
             When the initiates walked to get food from nearby
            homesteads, he collapsed repeatedly; when he asked the
            nurses to call his brother, they refused; when he tried
            in his weakened state to run away, they caught him and
            took him back to the school.<br />
            <br />
             When his uncle, Wadana Boya, finally alerted to the
            boy's plight, went to the school last Friday, he found
            Yongama, pitifully thin, in a coma.<br />
            <br />
             Yongama died soon after he arrived there.<br />
            <br />
             The nurses, according to Mtsasa, claimed that his
            death was caused by witchcraft, but the other boys said
            Yongama had been sick for at least a week before his
            death.<br />
            <br />
             "This thing has happened there several times," Mtsasa
            said. "In 2005, there was a boy who passed away under
            the supervision of the same traditional nurse [the one
            who circumcised Yongama]."<br />
            <br />
             Mtsasa, who works in Durban, drove down the same
            night, and discovered that the nurse had "cheated the
            police" by claiming Yongama died of natural
            causes.<br />
            <br />
             "After I talked to the police, they changed the docket
            to murder," he said.<br />
            <br />
             "They [the nurses] are doing something that's totally
            unacceptable. Even the old people from our area, they
            are complaining about the same thing."<br />
            <br />
             Mtsasa said the Mthatha district surgeon initially put
            "natural causes" in his post-mortem report.<br />
            <br />
             However, after Mtsasa secured the intervention of the
            Eastern Cape health department, a second post-mortem
            was performed by a Port Elizabeth forensic specialist
            on Wednesday and the cause of death changed to
            "unnatural".<br />
            <br />
             The investigating officer in the case, Detective
            Sergeant Vuyani Mvana of the Sulenkama police station,
            confirmed he was investigating a murder docket, and
            said statements had already been taken from the
            traditional surgeon and from Mtsasa.<br />
            <br />
             The nurses had so far not been "available", but once
            their statements had been taken, all the documentation
            would go to the directorate of public prosecutions for
            a decision.<br />
            <br />
             Mvana said he had been told that some of the boys -
            including Yongama - had been forced to sleep in the
            open, without blankets, despite the bad weather.<br />
            <br />
             On Friday, the shelters at the school were burned,
            marking the completion of the initiation ritual for the
            remaining 23 youths, and they assumed the status of
            men.<br />
            <br />
             On Saturday, Yongama will be buried at Ethwa.<br />
            <br />
             "I don't know what's going to happen at the funeral,"
            Mtsasa said. "We're trying to calm people down: they
            want to take revenge. But it's not going to wake him
            up.<br />
            <br />
             "All the people around the area, they're crying." -
