            <h2>Brazil Says No to Circumcision</h2>

            <p><a
            href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6502855.stm"
            target="_blank">A recent report by the World Health
            Organization</a> (WHO) indicates that the practice of
            <b>circumcision</b> could be <b>effective in preventing
            the transmission of HIV</b>. Reacting to these
            findings, the technical advisor for the <a
            href="http://portal.saude.gov.br/saude/"
            target="_blank">Brazilian Health Ministry</a> says that
            her country <b>will not begin practicing
            circumcisions</b> due to what she considers
            <b>misleading</b> information:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p><i>"I find the recommendations of the WHO and U.N.
              HIV/AIDS program a little surprising and even
              frightening," Simao told Agencia Brasil.</i></p>

              <p><i>...This proposal gives a message of "false
              protection" because men might think that being
              circumcized means that they can have sex without
              condoms without any risk, which "is untrue", she
              said.</i></p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Simao also says that the study only showed that
            circumcision was effective in combating transmission
            from women to men, and that there is <b>no data which
            shows a decrease in transmission of HIV in gay men</b>.
            She also stated that she fears that funds currently
            dedicated to other forms of prevention and treatment
            might be redirected to circumcision.</p>

            <p>It's interesting that Brazil would speak out
            publicly on this issue, because, according to Spain's
            <a href="http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/219548"
            target="_blank"><i>20 Minutos</i></a>, the report's
            findings only apply to "countries in which <b>more than
            15% of the population is infected"</b>, and Brazil
            doesn't fit that description, nor does any other Latin
            American country.</p>
