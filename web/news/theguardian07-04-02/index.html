            <p>Toll from single 'school' shows up dangers of
            tradition</p>

            <p><b>Mungo Soggot in Johannesburg<br />
            Thursday July 4, 2002<br />
            The Guardian</b></p>

            <p>The death toll at an "initiation school" outside
            Johannesburg has now risen to six, after a young man
            who returned there died, apparently after being
            assaulted.</p>

            <p>The school is one of several traditional camps near
            Heidelberg, outside Johannesburg, where boys are
            supposed to be taken through their traditional rites of
            passage.</p>

            <p>But over the past week the camps have highlighted
            the potential horrors of ritual circumcision in South
            Africa, where young initiates frequently suffer at the
            hands of drunken or incompetent traditional
            surgeons.</p>

            <p>In addition to five other deaths which happened last
            week, 50 young men from initiation schools in the
            Heidelberg area were taken to hospital suffering from
            penis wounds or pneumonia.</p>

            <p>A post-mortem examination found that the latest
            victim, Papa Mbovane, 19, died of kidney failure after
            being beaten with a blunt object. The other five boys
            died from circumcision wounds, pneumonia and
            assault.</p>

            <p>Mr Mbovane's family has been quoted as saying he had
            left the school, but had returned after a traditional
            healer warned that boys risked going mad if their
            initiations were not completed.</p>

            <p>The Heidelberg tragedy has attracted particular
            attention because the victims were allegedly assaulted
            and kept in freezing conditions, and because the deaths
            took place not in the rural hinterland, but in the
            industrial heartland.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, health officials in the Eastern Cape
            province yesterday said that 13 mutilated initiates had
            been admitted to the Umtata general hospital since the
            weekend.</p>

            <p>Elsewhere, more than 100 boys have recently been
            admitted to hospitals in Limpopo province with septic
            circumcision wounds, while eight initiation schools in
            the province have reportedly been closed down in the
            past week.</p>

            <p>In the Eastern Cape, the Umtata general hospital's
            acting chief medical superintendent, Dr Zola Dabula,
            said that of the 13 young men who had been admitted,
            three were severely dehydrated, and a fourth had lost
            his penis after it became gangrenous.</p>

            <p>Previously, the Eastern Cape was notorious for
            botched circumcisions. Now it is more advanced than
            many other parts of the country.</p>

            <p>One of the people at the forefront of the change in
            attitudes in the Eastern Cape has been the health
            department's Dr Mamisa Chabula, who successfully
            entered the male-dominated world and encouraged
            traditional surgeons to change their ways.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/"
            target="_blank">African National Congress</a>
            government in the province has recently sought to
            regulate ritual circumcision - no easy move for a
            government that has to constantly strike a balance
            between western and traditional practices.</p>

            <p>The province also brought in an education programme
            encouraging people to have their circumcisions
            performed surgically at hospitals, after which they can
            complete the rituals necessary to satisfy
            tradition.</p>

            <p>The Eastern Cape's programme appears to be paying
            off. At the Umtata general hospital, Dr Dabula told the
            South African Press Association yesterday that whereas
            there had previously been "very serious problems" with
            circumcisions in the area, "right now we haven't lost
            anyone".</p>

            <p>Dr Dabula said that initiation schools were corrupt
            and cruel places, which were "more than anything a
            place of vengeance. People who got beaten to a pulp in
            their day are there to inflict upon others the
            treatment they got."</p>

            <p>After the Heidelberg scandal erupted last week, the
            ministry of health in the province of Gauteng - which
            includes both Johannesburg and Heidelberg - announced
            that it was closing three initiation schools on the
            farm where the deaths had occurred.</p>

            <p>According to local press reports, the schools
            remained open this week.</p>
