      <h2>Genital mutilation has no place in society</h2>

      <p>It is ironic that columnist A.M. Rosenthal (`Bipartisan
      mercy' could curtail mutilation rituals, May 29) condemns
      female genital mutilation when his own religion practices
      male genital mutilation. Unmentioned in the column are the
      atrocities that regularly accompany ritual Jewish male
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>Male circumcision is no less barbaric than female
      circumcision despite its euphemistic name and respectability
      from tradition and religious mumbo jumbo. In fact, because it
      is carried out on helpless male infants, its practice is even
      less defensible.</p>

      <p>Attempts to justify circumcision's barbarism, such as
      greater cleanliness, reduction of cervical cancer in mates,
      etc., have been discredited. In any case, done for this
      reason, the procedure is analogous to amputating a foot to
      prevent fungus.</p>

      <p>Male circumcision is carried out for the same reason as
      female circumcision -- an attempt to control youthful
      sexuality.</p>

      <p>The anti-God aspect of circumcision seems lost on its
      religious devotees; foreskin excision implies that man is
      correcting God's inferior design. In truth, we are born
      perfect in every way.</p>
