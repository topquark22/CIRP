            <h2>Parents Face Jail over Female Circumcision
            'Holidays'</h2>

            <p><i>By David Barrett, PA News</i></p>

            <p>Parents who take their daughters abroad to undergo
            female circumcision will face up to 14 years in jail
            under measures which come into force today.</p>

            <p>Home Secretary David Blunkett announced a year ago
            that he would act to close a loophole in measures which
            banned female circumcision 17 years ago.</p>

            <p>Some ethnic minority communities have evaded the law
            by arranging for girls to have the operation during a
            &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; abroad.</p>

            <p>Female circumcision involves the surgical removal of
            the clitoris, and sometimes parts of the labia,
            reducing the ability to feel sexual pleasure.</p>

            <p>Female genital mutilation is common among Somali,
            Ethiopian, Eritrean, Yemeni, Malaysian and Indonesian
            communities.</p>

            <p>Around 138 million women worldwide have undergone
            genital mutilation, according to the <a
            href="http://www.who.int/en/" target="_blank">World
            Health Organisation</a>.</p>

            <p>Experts believe there are 74,000 first generation
            African immigrant women in the UK who have undergone
            female circumcision.</p>

            <p>There are also up to 7,000 girls under 16 within
            these communities who are at risk from the
            procedure.</p>

            <p>The operation is usually performed on girls between
            the ages of four and 13, but can sometimes be inflicted
            on newborn babies or on young women before marriage or
            pregnancy.</p>

            <p>Numerous reasons given for the practice include
            custom and tradition, religious demand, family honour,
            hygiene and prevention of promiscuity.</p>

            <p>Female genital mutilation is a criminal offence in
            the UK under the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act
            1985.</p>

            <p>The Female Genital Mutilation Act re-enacts
            provisions of the 1985 Act and gives them power outside
            UK borders.</p>
