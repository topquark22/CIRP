      <h2>Newborns and Chronic Pain Study:<br />
      Pain during first days may lead to sensitivity as adult</h2>

      <p>By <b>Jamie Talan</b>, Staff Writer</p>

      <p>Experiments on newborn animals suggest that chronic pain
      during the first days of life may result in permanent
      hypersensitivity to pain in adulthood, a finding that may
      have enormous implications for newborns undergoing rigorous
      medical procedures, scientists say.</p>

      <p>M.A. Ruda and her colleagues at the <a
      href="http://www.nidr.nih.gov/">National Institute of Dental
      and Craniofacial Research</a> found that rat pups that
      received a painful stimulus that affected them for several
      days-a toxin injected into the hind paw-had a much more
      dramatic response to pain as adults. When the researcher
      looked at nerve fibers that extended from the once-injured
      paw to the spinal column, they found that the experimental
      animals had 20 percent more pain-fibers than the control
      animals, and that the fibers extended to areas along which
      pain fibers don't normally travel.</p>

      <p>The fear, of course, is that in humans, similar changes
      occur in newborns exposed to chronic pain during medical
      procedures, or even religious circumcision sometimes done
      without local anesthesia.</p>

      <p>"We have to pay attention to the amount of pain and tissue
      injury in the newborn," Ruda said. "These procedures may be
      creating a heightened sensitivity to pain that will last a
      lifetime." The results of their work appear in the latest
      issue of <a
      href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/">Science</a>.</p>

      <p>"The nervous system is very plastic during development,"
      Ruda said.</p>

      <p>"Atypical outside events [like chronic pain] can impact
      how the pain system is coming together." "The potential
      exists to teach the central nervous system a different
      response to pain," Ruda said.</p>

      <p>Dr. Clifford Woolf, professor of anesthesia research at <a
      href="http://www.hms.harvard.edu/">Harvard Medical
      School</a>, said he is impressed by the federal study. "For a
      long time it was thought that newborns don't feel much pain,
      and the standard care was delivered without pain medicines.
      Things have changed somewhat. But this study suggests that
      pain during the newborn period can lead to lasting
      changes."</p>

      <p>Woolf points to a study by British colleagues, published
      last year in the medical journal <i>Lancet</i>, who looked at
      the way 9-month-old children responded to booster vaccines.
      The only strong correlation to the child's hypersensitivity
      to pain, he said, was whether they had been circumcised.</p>

      <p>Ruda wonders what effects repeated needle sticks to the
      heel in the newborn nursery might have on a child's
      developing nervous system. Her goal is to study newborns to
      figure out whether preemies or those who spend a lot of time
      undergoing medical procedures in the newborn nursery develop
      an exaggerated response to pain.</p>
