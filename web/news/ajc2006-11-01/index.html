            <p>By <a href="mailto:lmungin@ajc.com">LATEEF
            MUNGIN</a><br />
             The Atlanta Journal-Constitution<br />
             Published on: 11/01/06</p>

            <p>Accused mutilator Khalid Adem was found guilty
            Wednesday and sentenced to 10 years in prison and five
            years probation.</p>

            <p>After deliberating for about four hours the jury of
            seven women and five men found Adem guilty of
            aggravated battery and cruelty to children.</p>

            <p>Judge Richard Winegarden sentenced Adem to 15 years
            for both charges to run concurrently. He will serve 10
            years in prison and five years' probation. The maximum
            sentence for the charges was up to 40 years in
            prison.</p>

            <p>Authorities say Adem, 31, circumcised his daughter
            sometime in 2001 when the girl was 2. Health and human
            rights activists refer to the procedure as female
            genital mutilation.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.cirp.org/news/ajc07-18-03/"
            target="_blank">The mother reported the crime in
            2003</a>.</p>

            <p>The jury apparently chose to believe Adem's young
            daughter who testified earlier in the trial. The young
            girl, now 7, told the jury that Adem cut her. Adem
            cried many times during the trial and he testified that
            he did not do it and that he loved his daughter. He had
            blamed his ex-wife and the maternal grandmother of
            circumcising the girl.</p>

            <p>Adem sobbed after the guilty verdict was read.
            Moments after that his girlfriend, who was in court,
            collapsed and went into convulsions. The courtroom was
            cleared and paramedics were called.</p>

            <p>Outside the courtroom, the scene quickly
            deteriorated. Adem supporters began to wail and hold
            each other. One man, who was taken from the courthouse
            by sheriff deputies, shouted: "Khalid is not guilty. We
            need justice."</p>
