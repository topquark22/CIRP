            <p>By Jeff Baird<br />
            <a

            <p>The Forum - 02/11/2003</p>

            <p>A policy-maker for the premier standard-setting
            organization on infant circumcision in America
            testified Monday that the care given to Anita Flatt
            "met or even exceeded" the norm.</p>

            <p><a href="/library/complications/kaplan/">Dr. George
            Kaplan</a>, one of six doctors from across the country
            selected to review infant circumcision for the American
            Academy of Pediatrics, told jurors he came to his
            conclusion after reviewing medical records and from
            depositions from people that cared for the child.</p>

            <p>"I feel (<a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734"
             target="_blank">Dr. Sunita Kantak</a>) did inform Mrs.
            Flatt on what was to be done," said Kaplan, the chief
            of urology and surgery at the <a
            href="http://www.chsd.org/" target="_blank">Children's
            Hospital</a> in San Diego.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.zbaer.com/anita.htm">Flatt</a>
            of <a href="http://www.hawley.govoffice.com/"
            target="_blank">Hawley</a>, Minn., is suing Kantak and
            Fargo-based <a href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Hospital</a> claiming she and
            her husband, James, weren't told complete and accurate
            information about the procedure for removing the
            foreskin from their son's penis.</p>

            <p>She has told the jury she did not receive any
            information prior to her son's birth about the risks
            and benefits of circumcision.</p>

            <p>She says she never received the booklet MeritCare
            gives to parents, and only talked to Kantak briefly
            about the pain involved before the procedure was
            performed.</p>

            <p>Had Flatt understood the risks involved in the
            procedure, she wouldn't have had it done, she said.</p>

            <p>Flatt attorney, <a
            href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a>, asked Kaplan if he made
            assumptions in determining adequate information was
            given to Flatt.</p>

            <p>"In part, yes," Kaplan said.</p>

            <p>Baer then asked if one of those assumptions was that
            MeritCare employees followed procedure by giving Flatt
            the circumcision booklet and talking to her about the
            procedure.</p>

            <p>Kaplan said yes, pointing to two references in
            MeritCare medical records documenting discussions with
            or material given to Flatt on circumcision and noted
            that Flatt signed the consent form.</p>

            <p>He said most parents don't sign the consent slip if
            they still have questions about the procedure.</p>

            <p>Baer showed Kaplan that one of the medical records
            documenting discussion on circumcision was dated a day
            after the surgery.</p>

            <p>The other record documenting circumcision discussion
            was signed by Kantak the day before the March 7, 1997,
            circumcision, but not initialed by Flatt, Baer
            said.</p>

            <p>Flatt said she didn't meet with Kantak until March
            7.</p>

            <p>When Baer asked Kaplan what the foreskin was for, he
            said that is not known.</p>

            <p>"Yet you remove it?" Baer said.</p>

            <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics concluded in 1999
            there are some potential medical benefits to
            circumcision but not enough to recommend routine
            newborn circumcision.</p>

            <p>The academy encourages parents to discuss the
            benefits and risks of circumcision with their
            pediatrician, and then make an informed decision about
            what is in the best interest of the child, Kaplan
            said.</p>

            <p>Circumcision benefits include a lower rate of
            urinary infections and cases of penile cancer, Kaplan
            said.</p>

            <p>The major risks in circumcision include infection,
            most of which are treatable with antibiotics, and
            bleeding, Kaplan said.</p>

            <p>MeritCare attorneys were allowed to call Kaplan
            before Baer was done calling his witnesses because of a
            conflict in Kaplan's schedule.</p>

            <p>Baer will resume examining one of his witnesses
            today.</p>

            <p>Flatt, an attorney at Baer's law firm, is asking for
            an unspecified amount in damages.</p>

            <p>The trial, in its sixth day, is expected to end this
            week. <a
