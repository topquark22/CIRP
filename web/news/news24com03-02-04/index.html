            <h2>Circumcision village launched</h2>
            02/03/2004 11:20 - (SA) 

            <p>Cape Town - A project to establish an initiation
            village for urban Xhosa has been launched by the
            Western Cape <a
            href="http://www.westerncape.gov.za/default.asp"
            target="_blank">provincial government</a> on the Cape
            Flats.</p>

            <p>The initiative, billed as the first in the country,
            seeks to provide space for what is essentially a rural
            custom in a city setting.</p>

            <p>In its purest form, groups of newly-circumcised
            young men are required to spend a period isolated in
            makeshift shelters in the bush or veld, a ritual
            difficult to observe on the periphery of crowded
            townships.</p>

            <p>A spokesperson for the Western Cape's environment
            affairs department said the idea of an initiation
            village followed a workshop held at Langa and a series
            of public participation meetings.</p>

            <p>The department has provided R1,2m seed money towards
            the project, which would take shape on an allocated
            site of a few hectares within the 650ha <a
            href="http://www.capenature.org.za/nature_reserves/html/driftsands.html"
            target="_blank">Driftsands nature reserve</a> near
            Khayelitsha.</p>

            <p>The "community" would have to decide how to run the
            village, but money had been allocated for site works,
            landscaping and other facilities including a slaughter
            slab.</p>

            <p>It was envisaged that about 600 youths would go
            through the facility every year.</p>

            <p>The department estimates that there are about a
            million people living within a seven-kilometre radius
            of the site.</p>
