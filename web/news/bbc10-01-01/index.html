      law</b></font></p>
    </div>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p>A law passed by the Swedish Parliament restricting the
      circumcision of boys goes into effect on Monday.</p>

      <p>Circumcisions will now be allowed only under anaesthetic,
      and with a doctor or nurse present.</p>

      <p>Swedish Jews and Muslims object to the new law, saying it
      violates their religious rights.</p>

      <p>The law was introduced after a <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/news/aftonbladet02-09-01/">Muslim
      boy died while being circumcised.</a></p>

      <p>But, according to the website of Stockholm's Jewish
      community, a government commission appointed after the
      three-year-old's death found that the circumcision had been
      carried out by a registered physician, and that the cause of
      death was an overdose of aneasthetics.</p>

      <h3>Health benefits debated</h3>

      <p>A BBC science correspondent says there has been much
      debate over the medical benefits of male circumcision - some
      studies say it reduces the chance of contracting a sexually
      transmitted disease and improves hygiene levels, while others
      show there to be no health benefit whatsoever.</p>

    <div class="act">
      <h3><strong>Circumcision Act</strong></h3>

      <p class="act">A boy under the age of two months old may be
      circumcised by a person who is not a registered physician
      provided that person has obtained special authorization from
      the National Board of Health and Welfare.</p>

      <p class="act">No boy may be circumcised without an
      anaesthetic, which must be administered either by a
      registered physician or by a registered nurse.</p>

      <p class="act">The new law comes into force on 1 October.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="corpus">
      <p>Stockholm's Jewish community is now deciding how to take
      the matter further.</p>

      <p>They say they will not be able to find nurses or doctors
      to help them perform the ceremony because many health
      professionals in Sweden view circumcision as a form of
      mutilation.</p>

      <p>In its website, the community says that making
      circumcision impossible to carry out in practice would make
      the Swedish-Jewish congregation, which is already a small
      minority in Sweden, feel isolated and vulnerable.</p>

      <p>It adds that it is in principle not the task of the
      Swedish non-Jewish society to educate the Jewish
      minority.</p>

      <p>"It is a scandal that the Riksdag [parliament], which has
      recently recognised the Jewish group as a national minority,
      shortly after introduces a restriction on Jewish life in
      Sweden, with unforeseeable consequences," the website
      said.</p>
