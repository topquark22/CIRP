      <h2>Mother's battle to circumcise is in court</h2>
      <b>BY KATE COSCARELLI<br />
      STAFF WRITER</b> 

      <p>A 3-year-old boy is caught in a legal tornado that could
      change the way parents care for their children.</p>

      <p>Tomorrow, that twister is set to touch down in Superior
      Court Judge Paul Armstrong's Somerville courtroom at a
      hearing to determine if a circumcision is medically warranted
      for Matthew Price.</p>

      <p>The case, part of the ongoing divorce proceedings between
      Jennifer and James Price, has grabbed the attention of legal
      scholars, medical societies, media outlets and attorneys
      around the country.</p>

      <p>Matthew's physical health is the centerpiece of the
      hearing. But also significant are the possibilities that the
      judge's decision could affect how doctors deal with patients,
      how separated parents make health care decisions for their
      children and how involved the courts should be in either
      issue.</p>

      <p>"It raises an interesting question of the scope of
      judicial intervention when estranged parents are in dispute
      about the welfare of the child," said <a
      href="http://info.rutgers.edu/RUSLN/cantor.html"
      target="_blank">Norman Cantor</a>, a family law professor at
      <a href="http://nwk-web.rutgers.edu/law/"
      target="_blank">Rutgers School of Law</a> in Newark.</p>

      <p>The case started with a divorce.</p>

      <p>Five years into his parents' marriage, Matthew was born
      about 1 p.m. on Aug. 18, 1997, at <a
      href="http://jfkmc.org/index.htm" target="_blank">John F.
      Kennedy Hospital</a> in Edison. The boy was not
      circumcised.</p>

      <p>Soon after Matthew's birth, the Price's marriage started
      to disintegrate. Jennifer Price of Clinton filed for divorce
      in March. The Prices currently have joint custody of their
      son.</p>

      <p>Then came the irritations&mdash;two of them&mdash;of
      Matthew's penis that left him swollen and in pain, sending
      him to the emergency room.</p>

      <p>"He complains of pain and burning during urination," wrote
      Matthew's pediatrician, Grace Calimlim of Bridgewater. In her
      estimation, the problem was chronic and could be dealt with
      through circumcision. A second doctor, pediatric urologist
      Joseph Barone, agreed.</p>

      <p>Matthew's parents were hopelessly divided.</p>

      <p>Jennifer Price's attorney now says her client had wanted a
      circumcision performed at birth, but gave in to her husband's
      wishes.</p>

      <p>James Price continues to object to circumcision. The
      Raritan man underwent several painful surgeries as a small
      child to correct a malformed urethra and says he wouldn't
      want his son to experience the same thing. He has also cited
      concerns about the possibility that Matthew could experience
      reduced sexual pleasure.</p>

      <p>"I believe God made Matthew perfect and if he isn't broke,
      don't fix him," the father wrote in a letter to the
      judge.</p>

      <p>So the matter went to court.</p>

      <p>In August, Judge Paul Armstrong took the suggestions of
      the boy's physicians and ordered a circumcision.</p>

      <p>"The surgery is minor and will give Matthew the best
      chance to alleviate his problem," wrote Armstrong.</p>

      <p>Jennifer Price feels the same way, said her attorney,
      Ronald Heymann.</p>

      <p>"It has been her belief, and continues to be her belief,
      that circumcision is Matthew's best option," said
      Heymann.</p>

      <p>However, James Price threatened legal action against the
      doctor and the surgery was canceled. The group returned to
      court and the judge stuck with his original decision.</p>

      <p>An appellate division panel agreed with Armstrong.</p>

      <p>State Supreme Court Justice Peter Verniero issued an
      emergency stay the following day, and on Oct. 31 the justices
      voted to send the matter back to Armstrong for a full
      hearing.</p>

      <p>For the purposes of the hearing, Edward O'Donnell, an
      attorney from the infamous Baby M trial, and Robert Pickens,
      a well-respected Princeton physician, have been assigned to
      act as independent experts on Matthew's behalf.</p>

      <p>As is often the case with divorcing parents, medical
      decisions must be made by the courts. But usually those
      decisions are of life- threatening matters.</p>

      <p>The crux of the debate now hinges over the idea that the
      judge will decide if the procedure is "medically necessary"
      as the Supreme Court suggested it should be in its
      opinion.</p>

      <p>It is an intentionally vague term, say court watchers. And
      in this case it probably means medically appropriate, rather
      than lifesaving.</p>

      <p>"I am not at all sure it was intended to be taken
      literally as setting down the standard of absolute necessity
      for the medical procedure," said Cantor.</p>

      <p>Legal analysts worry the case might set a volatile
      precedent that could send disputing parents to court to
      debate whether their child should receive antibiotics or
      braces -- minor health issues that have always been left up
      to the custodial parent to decide. In this case, Jennifer
      Price is the custodial parent.</p>

      <p>"I do worry about that (potential) if there is not some
      strong reason why the court has to make this decision rather
      than leaving it to the parents to work it out," said law
      professor John DeWitt Gregory of <a
      href="http://www.hofstra.edu/Academics/Law/index_Law.cfm"
      target="_blank">Hofstra University School of Law</a> on Long
      Island.</p>

      <p>But the case is a double-edged sword. Doctors say if the
      judge decides the circumcision isn't warranted, despite
      medical testimony, it undercuts their authority.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.msnj.org/" target="_blank">Medical
      Society of New Jersey</a> and the Urology Society of New
      Jersey object to the intervention of the courts in the
      absence of extraordinary circumstances and suggest the
      treating physicians should be heard. The court should not
      become a "super-doctor."</p>

      <p>"Is a court to involve itself in deciding whether a
      splinter should be removed with a needle or a tweezer? . . .
      Obviously not," the societies wrote in a friend-of-the-court
      brief.</p>

      <p>Circumcision is a relatively routine operation "with no
      real chance of permanent physical or psychological damage to
      the patient," the brief continued.</p>

      <p>This case also is believed to be a national landmark in
      the debate over circumcision. The practice of routine
      circumcision has come under scrutiny in the last year.</p>

      <p>Last March, the <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/">American
      Academy of Pediatrics</a> stepped back from its position that
      the procedure be done routinely at birth. About 64 percent of
      the nation's boys are circumcised shortly after birth,
      according to the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>

      <p>The revised statement said removing the foreskin had
      medical benefits, but the advantages are not so compelling
      that every newborn should undergo the surgery.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/"
      target="_blank">National Organization of Circumcision
      Information Resource Centers</a>, a nonprofit
      California-based group, advocates that circumcision is
      mutilation that is a $2.1 billion industry in the United
      States. Boys should be allowed to make the decision about the
      surgery on their own, they argue.</p>

      <p>"Matthew does not need a circumcision. He would suffer
      irreparable physical, sexual and emotional injury if
      subjected to a penile surgery," argued NOCIRC in a legal
      brief filed earlier this week. Because the attorney did not
      secure the proper paperwork, it has not yet been determined
      if the brief will be considered by the judge.</p>

      <p>Attorneys in the case have expressed concern that larger
      issues have been raised, perhaps overshadowing what is in
      Matthew's best interest.</p>

      <p>"This matter before the court is of a most intimate and
      personal nature to Matthew," O'Donnell wrote in a legal
      brief. "As a 3-year-old child, he is not yet old enough to
      understand the medical attention this matter has
      generated."</p>
