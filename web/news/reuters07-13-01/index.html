      <h2>Couple Separate Over Circumcision</h2>

      <p><b>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -</b> The parents of a newborn boy
      have separated in a dispute over whether to have the child
      circumcised, a fight that has landed in court.</p>

      <p>Sheila Grisham says circumcision is important to her
      religious beliefs. Her husband, Rodney Grisham, says the
      procedure is equivalent to sexual assault and has filed a
      protection-from-abuse order in his son's name in a <a
      href="http://distcrt18.state.ks.us/" target="_blank">Sedgwick
      County court</a>.</p>

      <p>``I believe every child has a right to have their genitals
      left alone,'' he said.</p>

      <p>In circumcision, an anesthetic is usually applied to the
      penis and the foreskin is cut away. The <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">American Academy of
      Pediatrics</a> said it carries few medical benefits and is
      generally unnecessary, but suggests families follow their
      personal preferences.</p>

      <p>The couple's 2-week-old son, Asher, is staying with his
      mother.</p>

      <p>Sheila Grisham said she consulted with her <a
      href="http://www.fpcwichita.org/pastor.htm"
      target="_blank">pastor</a>, who believes circumcision is not
      necessary for salvation but is an important part of Judaic
      Christian heritage.</p>
