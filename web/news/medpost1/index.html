      <h1>Australians argue for ban on circumcision</h1>

      <h3>By CHRIS PRITCHARD</h3>
      <b>Doctors could be put at risk of later legal action</b>

      <p>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA---Routine circumcision on baby boys
      should be banned in the same way female genital mutilation is
      outlawed, a group of Australian lawyers and children's rights
      activists argued recently.</p>

      <p>The group wants an end to the country's medicare coverage
      of the cost of the procedure. It warned doctors performing
      routine circumcisions they could in time face huge claims for
      physical and psychological damage.</p>

      <p>In an <a href="/library/legal/boyle1/">article</a> in the
      <i>Journal of Law and Medicine</i>, Dr. Gregory Boyle, a
      professor at Queensland's Bond University, and three lawyers
      contend male circumcision is an `assault causing grievous
      bodily harm.'</p>

      <p>The article argues `laws against female genital
      mutilation, which do not simultaneously prohibit male genital
      mutilation, contravene principles of equal protection
      enshrined in human rights law.'</p>

      <p>Despite the fact no national medical association endorses
      the practice, medicare statistics show 20,000 boys were
      circumcised in Australia in 1997/98, the latest year for
      which figures are available. This represents 10% to 15% of
      newborn males.</p>

      <p>The article claims circumcision removes 50% of penile
      skin, makes achieving orgasm difficult and is dangerous.
      Recent legal precedents cast doubt over whether parents can
      provide legal consent for the practice, the article says.</p>

      <p>And doctors who carry out the procedure are risking
      litigation.</p>

      <p>One Australian man last year won almost $350,000 in
      damages because of physical and sexual harm caused by a
      neonatal circumcision.</p>

      <p>Australian Medical Association president Dr. David Brand
      said contemporary medical opinion does not support routine
      circumcision of baby boys. It would, he added, be wrong to
      ban the practice because in some cases there is a medical
      need for it.</p>

      <p>Some boys suffer urinary and skin infections because their
      foreskin is too tight and surgery is needed, he said.</p>

      <p>The immediate past-president of the executive council of
      Australian Jewry, Dianne Shteinman, reacted to the article by
      saying circumcision is a vital element in the practice of the
      Jewish religion and her community would fight any attempts to
      ban it.</p>
