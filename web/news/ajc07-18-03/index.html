            'circumcision'</h2>

            <h4>Illegal in U.S., practice goes underground</h4>

            <p>By <a href="mailto:cshoichet@ajc.com">CATHERINE E.
            SHOICHET</a><br />
             <font size="1">The Atlanta
            Journal-Constitution</font></p>

            <p>As a caseworker for <a
            href="http://www.refugeefamilyservices.org/"
            target="_blank">Refugee Family Services</a> in
            Clarkston, Laila Mohamed often helps immigrants
            struggling to maintain their culture in new
            surroundings.</p>

            <p>But there's one tradition Mohamed hopes they will
            leave behind -- female circumcision.</p>

            <p>"I'm one of the women who suffered. I don't want
            this to happen to the new generation," said the
            39-year-old Mohamed, who was a 6-year-old growing up in
            Sudan when her family arranged her "circumcision." The
            caseworker added, "It frequently happens in our
            community, but I want it to stop."</p>

            <p>Mohamed and other Atlanta caseworkers will be
            meeting with activists and educators from 10 African
            countries this weekend to discuss efforts to prevent
            the mutilating practice around the world -- and in
            local immigrant communities.</p>

            <p>The procedure, which involves removing the clitoris
            or all of the external genitalia, is illegal in the
            United States. But it remains an important cultural
            practice in many African countries, often serving as a
            coming-of-age ritual.</p>

            <p>Health and human rights activists who oppose the
            practice refer to it as "female genital mutilation" and
            condemn it as a dangerous, painful and unnecessary
            procedure.</p>

            <p>The four-day conference at the Holiday Inn Downtown,
            which starts today, is sponsored by <a
            href="http://www.equalitynow.org/"
            target="_blank">Equality Now</a>, an international
            women's rights advocacy group.</p>

            <p>The conference comes three months after a Gwinnett
            man was arrested and charged with cruelty to children
            and aggravated battery for allegedly circumcising his
            daughter, then 2 years old, with a pair of scissors in
            2001. Gwinnett police arrested Khalid Adem, 27, who
            immigrated from Ethiopia 10 years ago. Adem and his
            family say he had nothing to do with the act.</p>

            <p>The organization originally planned to hold the
            annual conference in Nairobi, Kenya, according to
            executive director Taina Bien-Aim&eacute;. But after
            learning of the Gwinnett case, organizers decided to
            hold meetings in Atlanta instead.</p>

            <p>"It's an incredible opportunity to break the silence
            about the issue," she said.</p>

            <p>Recent efforts to decrease the frequency of the
            procedure in Africa have been largely successful,
            Bien-Aim&eacute; said, but many in the United States
            remain unaware of its prevalence here.</p>

            <p>"It's even more disturbing to see progress in Africa
            while in this country we're not prepared to address the
            issue," she said.</p>

            <p>In 1997, the Atlanta-based <a
            href="http://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank">Centers for
            Disease Control and Prevention</a> estimated that over
            160,000 girls and women in immigrant communities in the
            United States may have undergone "circumcision."</p>

            <p>And refugee caseworkers say the practice remains
            frequent in some Atlanta communities. "It's still
            there, but people have decided to go underground and
            continue with this practice, which is frightening,"
            said Glory Kilanko, executive director of the
            Atlanta-based <a
            href="http://www.womenwatchafrika.org/pages/1/index.htm"
             target="_blank">Women Watch Afrika</a>.</p>

            <p>While preserving cultural traditions is important,
            Kilanko said, it's also necessary to review practices
            such as <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/female/">female
            circumcision</a>.</p>

            <p>"Cultural violence is still violence against women.
            People who are practicing this do not know why they are
            doing it," she said. "They were born into it. They feel
            they have no other choice."</p>

            <p>Congress passed a law prohibiting female
            circumcision in 1996. And though 16 states, including
            Texas, West Virginia and Tennessee, have laws barring
            the practice, Georgia does not.</p>

            <p>Bien-Aim&eacute; and others are hoping that will
            begin to change after this weekend's meeting, and that
            future local cases like Adem's will be prosecuted under
            a more specific state law prohibiting female
            circumcision. At the meeting's conclusion Monday,
            Equality Now and state Sen. Nadine Thomas (D-Decatur)
            plan to announce a bill that would make the practice
            illegal in Georgia.</p>

            <p>"You need to have laws that prohibit the practice,
            and you need to have law enforcement that aggressively
            prosecutes people who break the law," Bien-Aim&eacute;
            said.</p>
