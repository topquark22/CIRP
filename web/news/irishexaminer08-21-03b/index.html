            <h2>Baby dies after botched circumcision</h2>

            <p>By Neans McSweeney<br />
            GARDA&Iacute; were last night searching for a man who
            carried out a botched circumcision on a four-week-old
            baby who later died in hospital. Little Callis
            Osaghae's Nigerian parents, 31-year-old Idehen and his
            wife, Mabel, 23, rushed him to Waterford Regional
            Hospital when he began bleeding heavily after the
            procedure was carried out in a city centre house on
            Sunday night.</p>

            <p>The ritual circumcision on the baby was performed by
            a man who has no medical training. Staff at the
            hospital alerted garda&iacute; who have launched an
            investigation.</p>

            <p>Last night, Dr Philip Crowley, project director of
            the <a href="http://www.icgp.ie/" target="_blank">Irish
            College of General Practitioners</a>' General Practice
            in a Multicultural Society, said the Osaghae family had
            been failed by the Irish medical system.</p>

            <p>The ICGP has made several representations to the
            South Eastern Health Board, stressing the need for
            circumcision services on religious grounds in
            Waterford.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.sehb.ie/"
            target="_blank">South Eastern Health Board</a>
            confirmed last night that circumcisions at Waterford
            Regional Hospital were only carried out on medical
            grounds.</p>

            <p>However, Dr Crowley said: "There is a need for this
            service in Waterford. This tragedy has shown us that if
            people are determined to have a child circumcised, they
            will do so. Ireland is now a multicultural society and
            we should have these services available to those who
            chose to use them.</p>

            <p>"We have made several representations over the past
            months, urging the health board to develop this
            service. People would be less likely to have these
            procedures done in their own home, were they available
            in our hospitals. This little boy wouldn't have died
            were the procedure carried out in a hospital."</p>

            <p>Dr Margaret Bolster of the State Pathologists'
            office has already carried out a post mortem on the
            boy, but the results have been inconclusive.</p>

            <p>The couple rent a townhouse at Summerhill Mews,
            close to Waterford city centre. They have two daughters
            and the little boy was their first son. He was born on
            July 19 and would have been a month old on Tuesday.</p>

            <p>They arrived in Ireland over a year ago and made an
            application for asylum on June 27 last year. That
            application was subsequently withdrawn.</p>
