            <h2>No medical reason to circumcise children</h2>

            <p>19 May 2003</p>

            <p>DOCTORS have been advised to tell parents there is
            no medical reason to routinely circumcise boys.</p>

            <p>The <a
            href="http://www.racp.edu.au/hpu/paed/circumcision/index.htm"
             target="_blank">policy statement</a> developed by the
            paediatric and child health division of the <a
            href="http://www.racp.edu.au/" target="_blank">Royal
            Australasian College of Physicians</a> raises the
            prospect of future legal action if the surgery is
            performed.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Parents who have their child
            circumcised &ndash; and doctors who perform the surgery
            &ndash; could face legal action when the child grows
            up.</span></p>

            <p>The stance follows a major review of existing
            information and reaffirms the position of the <a
            href="/library/statements/acp1996/"
            target="_blank">College of Paediatrics</a> and the <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aaps/"
            target="_blank">Australasian Association of Paediatric
            Surgeons</a>.</p>

            <p>"Review of the literature in relation to risks and
            benefits shows there is no evidence of benefit
            outweighing harm for circumcision as a routine
            procedure," the RACP says.</p>

            <p>"There is no medical indication for routine male
            circumcision."</p>

            <p>In Australia the circumcision rate has fallen in
            recent years to about 10 per cent of male infants.</p>

            <p>The rate of complications from neo-natal
            circumcision is between 1 and 5 per cent.</p>
