            <h2>Boy bleeds to death after 'cut'</h2>

            <p>Story by EDWARD KOECH<br />
             Publication Date: 12/14/2007</p>

            <p>A 13-year-old boy has bled to death after he was
            circumcised at home in West Pokot.<br />
            <br />
             The Standard Five pupil at Kwonesis Primary School
            from excessive bleeding after being circumcised by a
            traditional attendant at his home in Kospot village,
            Chesegon Division on Wednesday.<br />
            <br />
             The boy, who was among others who underwent the cut
            has already been buried secretly in the bush in Sigor
            constituency location.<br />
            <br />
             Circumcision of both boys and girls is rampant and
            highly valued by the community.<br />
            <br />
             Chesegon division district officer Justus Motanya
            confirmed the death, adding that investigations were
            going on.<br />
            <br />
             In a related incident, an administration policeman was
            seriously injured after he was stoned by
            villagers.<br />
            <br />
             The attack came after police officers tried to stop
            the villagers from having three girls in Kepiam village
            in the district circumcised.<br />
            <br />
             A clergyman had alerted the local Provincial
            Administration of the planned circumcision, prompting
            them to immediately dispatch police officers to the
            village to stop the ceremony.<br />
            <br />
             But when the armed police officers arrived at the home
            where the ceremony was taking place, the villagers
            became wild and attacked them using stones, clubs and
            other weapons injuring one on the head.<br />
            <br />
             Sook division district officer Alvis Kolum said
            policemen shot in the air to scare the villagers away
            but they kept advancing and daring them to shoot with
            live ammunition.<br />
            <br />
             Mr Kolum said police retreated and avoided a clash,
            and the villagers also retreated but proceeded with the
            ceremony.<br />
            <br />
             The girls are aged between 13 and 15 years.</p>
