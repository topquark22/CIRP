            <p>For most central Ohio boys, life begins with
            cosmetic surgery. Shortly after birth, they are
            restrained, anesthetized and shorn of their
            foreskin.</p>

            <p>Historically, circumcision has been a routine
            procedure in the United States, but the rate dipped to
            a 50-year low of 55.9 percent in 2003, the most recent
            figures available from the <a
            href="http://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank">Centers for
            Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>

            <p>Nationally, the rate dropped 7.2 percent between
            2001 and 2003.</p>

            <p>Health-care professionals attribute the decline to
            the lack of medical reasons for doing the procedure and
            a rise in the number of immigrants from countries where
            it is not performed.</p>

            <p>In Ohio and the rest of the Midwest, the rate
            remains the nation&rsquo;s highest at 77.8 percent,
            although it is dropping slightly here as well.</p>

            <p>Central Ohio hospitals and pediatric practices
            report rates similar to the Midwest average.</p>

            <p>For example: About 80 percent of the 1,200 boys born
            at <a
            href="http://www.ohiohealth.com/facilities/grant/index.htm"
             target="_blank">Grant Medical Center</a> each year are
            circumcised, said Dr. Craig W. Anderson, director of
            newborn medicine.</p>

            <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Five years ago, it was 90
            percent."</p>

            <p>Bob and Jane O&rsquo;Shaughnessy chose not to
            circumcise their sons, who are 5 and 8.</p>

            <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;There didn&rsquo;t seem to be any good
            reason to put our children through the discomfort and
            pain," said Mrs. O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, 33.
            &lsquo;&lsquo;It seemed pointless to alter their bodies
            without any compelling medical benefits."</p>

            <p>Their decision was influenced by the <a
            href="http://www.aap.org/" target="_blank">American
            Academy of Pediatrics</a> and other major medical
            societies that don&rsquo;t recommend the procedure.</p>

            <p>"I would say that all pediatricians in town go with
            the academy&rsquo;s party line: This is a cosmetic
            surgery. There is no medical reason to do it," said Dr.
            Nancy Hansen, chairwoman of <a
            href="http://www.ohiohealth.com/facilities/riverside/index.htm"
             target="_blank">Riverside Methodist
            Hospital</a>&rsquo;s department of pediatrics.</p>

            <p>Many families choose circumcision for cultural
            reasons, Columbus doctors said.</p>

            <p>"They don&rsquo;t want their boys to look funny in
            the locker room," Hansen said.</p>

            <p>Justin and Heidi Green of Hilliard chose
            circumcision for their two sons, ages 3&frac12; years
            and 10 months, although they concluded that the
            procedure is medically unimportant.</p>

            <p>"We wanted our sons to look like their dad," Mrs.
            Green said.</p>

            <p>Hygiene often plays a role in the decision, but
            "that really isn&rsquo;t a good reason to justify
            circumcision," said Dr. JoAnn Rohyans of Olentangy
            Pediatrics on the Northwest Side, and spokeswoman for
            the Ohio Chapter of the American Academy of
            Pediatrics.</p>

            <p>The declining national rate comes while recent
            research in South Africa indicates that circumcision
            might reduce the transmission of HIV and other sexually
            transmitted diseases.</p>

            <p>"Studies have shown that cultures practicing
            circumcision are less likely to have HIV," said Dr.
            Michael Para, an infectious-disease specialist at <a
            href="http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/"
            target="_blank">Ohio State University Medical
            Center</a>.</p>

            <p>"If we can say for sure that circumcision reduces
            the risk of HIV, then suddenly there clearly is a
            medical benefit."</p>

            <p>For now, evidence is not strong enough to change
            medical-society policy statements.</p>

            <p>Decreases in urinary-tract infections among infants
            and penile cancer among adults are not significant
            enough to warrant the procedure, according to the <a
            href="http://www.ama-assn.org/"
            target="_blank">American Medical Association</a>.</p>

            <p>Pediatricians consider circumcision to be a simple
            and safe surgery. The complication rate is less than 1
            percent, according to the AMA. The most-common
            complications are adhesions, bleeding, infection and
            disfigurement.</p>

            <p>Seeing a picture of an infant strapped to a <a
            href="http://quickmedical.com/olympicmedical/circumstraint/immobolizer.html"
             target="_blank">restraint board</a> helped convince
            the O&rsquo;Shaughnessys.</p>

            <p>"That was the last straw," Mrs. O&rsquo;Shaughnessy
            said. "We were not going to have that done to our
            babies."</p>

            <p>Viewing an <a
            href="http://www.intact.ca/vidphil.htm"
            target="_blank">online video</a> of the procedure
            troubled the Greens.</p>

            <p>"After seeing that, my husband was overwhelmingly
            against it," Mrs. Green said, although the couple later
            changed their minds.</p>

            <p>During the past decade, the injection of numbing
            medication has helped ease pain and trauma.</p>

            <p>"About 75 percent of my babies sleep through it,"
            Hansen said.</p>

            <p>Pediatricians do most central Ohio circumcisions,
            although obstetricians, urologists, family doctors and
            mohels (in the Jewish rite) can also perform them.</p>

            <p>"Parents have more knowledge and are asking more
            questions about it," said Anderson, of <a
            href="http://www.ohiohealth.com/facilities/grant/index.htm"
             target="_blank">Grant Medical Center</a>.</p>

            <p>He added that some insurers are refusing to cover
            the elective procedure.</p>

            <p>Medicaid, for example, has stopped paying for
            circumcisions in 16 states.</p>

            <p>Bill Tulloss of the Cincinnati suburb of Evendale is
            lobbying Ohio to join the movement. Medicaid pays for
            one-third of Ohio births.</p>

            <p>"It is just crazy that Medicaid is spending taxpayer
            money on something that is not necessary at a time when
            Medicaid expenditures are bankrupting the state," said
            Tulloss, a retired college math professor and a member
            of the <a href="http://www.nocirc.org"
            target="_blank">National Organization of Circumcision
            Information Resource Centers</a>.</p>

            <p>The Ohio Medicaid program spent $4 million in
            federal and state money during the past three fiscal
            years to cover almost 62,000 circumcisions.</p>

            <p>"It&rsquo;s one of our smallest expenditures," said
            Dennis Evans, spokesman for the <a
            href="http://jfs.ohio.gov/" target="_blank">Department
            of Job and Family Services</a>.</p>

            <p>Dan Bollinger of West Lafayette, Ind., compiles
            circumcision rates from the CDC, hospital records and
            other sources for the <a href="http://www.icgi.org"
            target="_blank">International Coalition of Genital
            Integrity</a>.</p>

            <p>His statistics have been cited in the <a
            href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/"
            target="_blank">Journal of the American Medical
            Association</a>.</p>

            <p>"I have been showing a 1 to 2 percent annual
            decrease for the past 10 years, and I expect that to
            continue," said Bollinger, an industrial designer.
            "This is a steady social change that will be
            long-lasting."</p>

            <p>Bollinger is not sure why the Midwest rate leads the
            nation.</p>

            <p>He speculated that it is related to hospital
            construction in developing industrial centers when
            circumcision was introduced in the United States during
            the late 19 th century.</p>

            <p>While some parents can readily accept or reject
            circumcision, others are caught in the middle.</p>

            <p>"It was a big decision for us to make," Mrs. Green
            said. "We did a lot of research trying to figure out
            what to do. We didn&rsquo;t want to make the wrong
            decision because we knew it would have a lifelong
            effect."</p>
