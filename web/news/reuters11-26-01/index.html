      <h2>Italy Outlines Health Spending Cutbacks</h2>

      <p><b>FLORENCE (Reuters Health) -</b> The Italian government
      on Thursday detailed cuts in the national healthcare budget
      designed to save 1.4 trillion lira in the first year.</p>

      <p>The cutbacks were hammered out in an agreement between the
      national government and the regions. The State-Region
      Conference approved a shortened list of treatments that will
      be guaranteed all over the country, either free of charge or
      with a contribution by individuals.</p>

      <p>The healthcare spending bill also specifies the therapies
      and treatments that the national health system will no longer
      provide, and <span class="yellow">for which patients will
      have to pay entirely.</span></p>

      <p>The ``black list'' includes alternative therapies, plastic
      surgery except for cases of accidents or congenital
      malformations, dental treatment except for children and
      ''particularly vulnerable categories,'' <span
      class="yellow">circumcision</span>, refractive surgery except
      for particularly serious cases and vaccines for travelling
      purposes.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Avoiding waste is also key in
      hospital treatments.</span> The document on the basic levels
      of health assistance contains a list of 43 types of
      ``inappropriate'' admissions.</p>

      <p>For these treatments patients will have to undergo day
      surgery or ambulatory treatment. They include arthroscopy,
      cataract surgery, skin traumas, vein stripping and urinary
      calculosis without complications.</p>

      <p>The cuts are supposed to guarantee savings of 1.4 trillion
      lira in the first year.</p>

      <p>Since the new health spending law limits pharmaceutical
      spending to 13% of the overall health budget, each region
      will be allowed to ask patients for a contribution to help
      pay for drugs.</p>

      <p>The document divides drugs in four categories. Drugs in
      the first category will be totally reimbursed throughout the
      country. The remaining three categories include drugs for
      which contributions of 20%, 50% or 100% can be requested.</p>

      <p>``This agreement has been made without significant cuts
      for the citizens,'' Health Minister Girolamo Sirchia said in
      an official statement. ``This long and meticulous work to
      indicate the basic levels of assistance will produce great
      advantages in clinics and healthcare organizations.''</p>

      <p>The basic levels of health assistance will have to be
      approved by the <a
      href="http://www.governo.it/Governo/Struttura/cons_ministri.html"
      target="_blank">Council of Ministers</a> but are expected to
      take effect by November 30.</p>
