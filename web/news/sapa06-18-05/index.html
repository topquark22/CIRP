            18/06/2005 20:21 - (SA) 

            <p>Johannesburg - One youth has died at an initiation
            school at Engcobo in the Eastern Cape, the provincial
            <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/municipality/content.asp?PageID=742&amp;buster=2005%2F06%2F19+04%3A15%3A29+PM"
             target="_blank">health department</a> said on
            Saturday.</p>

            <p>A further nine boys were taken to the St Barnabas
            Hospital after the police and the department's
            officials closed another initiation school at Magcakini
            near Libode, the department's spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo
            said.</p>

            <p>The school's traditional nurse was arrested on
            charges of running the school without a permit from the
            provincial health department, Kupelo said.</p>

            <p>He said the 2001 Traditional Circumcision Act, which
            regulates the custom in the Eastern Cape, requires that
            traditional nurses obtain permits before running
            initiation schools.</p>

            <p>At Mamfengwini village, all initiates ran away after
            the police raided the school, which is run by a
            traditional surgeon the police are hoping to arrest on
            Sunday, Kupelo said.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Since 1995, more than 6 000
            boys have been admitted to different hospitals in the
            Eastern Cape, more than 300 have died and 76 had their
            genitals amputated due to botched
            circumcision.</span></p>

            <p>"We are attempting to curb that," Kupelo said,
            adding that a helicopter was used when the initiation
            schools were raided.</p>
