      <h3>Will North Carolina continue to pay for
      circumcisions?</h3>

      <p>To cut or not to cut--that is the question. For parents,
      it's a question of whether to allow their newborn sons'
      foreskins to be cut from their penises in the first few hours
      of life.</p>

      <p>June 12, 2002</p>

      <p><b>N E W S F E A T U R E</b></p>

      <p>For the <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/"
      target="_blank">North Carolina General Assembly</a>, it's a
      question of whether to cut or maintain Medicaid funding for
      this routine procedure as they try to fill the state's budget
      shortfall.</p>

      <p>The funding has so far been excluded from this year's
      proposed budget. Still, <a
      href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/" target="_blank">Gov.
      Mike Easley</a>, in his recently announced budget plan, vowed
      to maintain all optional Medicaid services. And as last
      year's legislative session proved, the governor is willing to
      apply political pressure in order to protect funding for
      Medicaid circumcisions.</p>

      <p>Effective Nov. 1, 2001, the legislature discontinued
      funding for the controversial procedure, which many in the
      medical community consider both unnecessary and harmful, as
      part of a large-scale effort to reduce the state's growing
      budget deficit.</p>

      <p>Then, five weeks later, the lawmakers suddenly reversed
      the decision in the final hours of the legislative session,
      after complaints from some members of the medical community
      and pressure from Gov. Easley.</p>

      <p>The North Carolina budget cites $646,000 as the expected
      cost of circumcision funding for the budget's two-year
      period, but according to the state's <a
      href="http://www.dhhs.state.nc.us/"
      target="_blank">Department of Health and Human Services</a>,
      North Carolina Medicaid actually paid around $3.5 million for
      34,112 newborn circumcisions in 2000 and 2001. The state
      foots about a third of that cost--$1.16 million--while county
      and federal sources pick up the rest. Still, the total cost
      to taxpayers for circumcisions during the last two-year
      budget period was $3.5 million.</p>

      <p>The legislature's initial cut in spending for circumcision
      came on the heels of recent statements by both the American
      Academy of Pediatrics (<a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">AAP</a>) and the American
      Medical Association (<a
      href="/library/statements/ama2000/">AMA</a>) that routine
      neonatal circumcision is not recommended for medical reasons.
      Circumcision, once thought to have important medical
      benefits, is now widely recognized as a cosmetic
      procedure.</p>

      <p>Some circumcision advocates still contend that the surgery
      results in slightly fewer infant urinary tract infections, a
      possible decrease in incidence of sexually transmitted
      diseases, and the prevention of penile cancer. But the AMA
      has stated that circumcision cannot responsibly be viewed as
      "protecting" against these afflictions. It maintains that in
      light of serious risks, the use of circumcision as a
      preventive practice is not justified. Currently, no national
      medical society in the world recommends routine infant
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>The legislature's decision to take circumcision funding
      out of its Medicaid payments did not affect religious
      circumcisions, which are not normally performed by doctors in
      hospitals but are performed ceremonially in a religious
      setting. And when the cut was proposed, letters and phone
      calls from the public came pouring in to support it. "I have
      received an amazing amount of correspondence on this issue,"
      comments <a
      href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/house/representative.pl?nUserID=239"
       target="_blank">Rep. Fern Shubert</a> (R-Marshville). "The
      majority of those writing support eliminating the
      reimbursement."</p>

      <p><a
      href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/senate/senator.pl?nUserID=49"
       target="_blank">Sen. Virginia Foxx</a> (R-Banner Elk)
      agrees: "I have received a lot of communications about this,
      many from doctors. All of them were saying we shouldn't be
      [funding circumcision]."</p>

      <p>And <a
      href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/senate/senator.pl?nUserID=8"
       target="_blank">Sen. Ellie Kinnaird</a> (D-Carrboro) says,
      "I've heard from health professionals and lay people about
      it, all against funding. Nobody contacted me in favor of
      funding."</p>

      <p>The constituents contacting their legislators wondered why
      the state would fund a medically unnecessary procedure when
      many North Carolinians don't have access to basic medical
      care. Some also expressed their philosophical opposition to
      subjecting infants to a painful and potentially damaging
      procedure without a medical reason.</p>

      <p>Dr. Robert Oliver, from Sylva, N.C.--a practicing
      obstetrician of 43 years with a Ph.D. in human
      sexuality--says, "The operation is painful, expensive, and
      portends many future problems for the baby growing into
      adulthood." Indeed, complications often occur in hospital
      circumcisions, including hemorrhage, infections ranging from
      trivial to life-threatening, and even surgical errors. The
      American Academy of Pediatrics has stated: "There is an
      inordinately large number of badly performed circumcisions
      with resultant deformed penises."</p>

      <p>In 1985, two Atlanta boys were damaged the same day during
      routine circumcisions--one whose penis was severely and
      permanently burned, and one whose penis was so thoroughly
      damaged that he subsequently underwent a "sex reassignment"
      (sex change) surgery while still a newborn.</p>

      <p>In 1986, a Louisiana family was awarded <a
      href="/news/1986.05.28_lawsuit/">$2.75 million in a
      lawsuit</a> after their son's penis was severely burned and
      subsequently amputated during a routine circumcision.</p>

      <p>In 1993 a <a href="/news/1993.06.21_death/">baby bled to
      death</a> in Miami, Fla., after being circumcised. And in
      1998, <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/evansdeath.htm"
      target="_blank">a 3-week-old boy died of anesthesia
      complications</a> while doctors attempted to fix a problem
      with his routine circumcision.</p>

      <p>Similar events, not always reported in the news, have
      occurred throughout the country, some of them right here in
      North Carolina.</p>

      <p>"I can't even count how many people [in North Carolina]
      I've talked with whose sons have experienced a botched
      circumcision requiring reconstructive surgery," says <a
      href="http://www.nocircnc.org/amber.htm">Amber Craig</a>,
      N.C. State Director of the National Association of
      Circumcision Information Resource Centers. "I have also been
      contacted by lawyers in North Carolina who were representing
      clients who had botched circumcisions."</p>

      <p>Will the 2002 NC General Assembly vote to continue funding
      these circumcisions without medical indication? It is
      difficult to say. As the legislature's last minute reversal
      last year demonstrates, the doctors performing Medicaid
      circumcisions are able to pull political strings and protect
      state funding that benefits their practices. But this year,
      the budget deficit has created a true crisis. Lawmakers are
      looking for money anywhere they can find it and opponents of
      circumcision want to show them where to cut.</p>

      <p>On Dec. 6, 2001, in the final hours of the longest N.C.
      legislative session in history, seven legislators met behind
      closed doors with no aide taking minutes and no media present
      to discuss last-minute budget "corrections." The cut in
      circumcision funding had been in effect for five weeks, and
      the <a
      href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/committee_lists/committee_lists.pl?House"
       target="_blank">Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and
      Human Services</a>, after research and review, had officially
      recommended that the funding continue to be left out of the
      budget.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, the seven legislators--the appropriations
      co-chairs of both houses, namely Representatives <a
      href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/house/representative.pl?nUserID=88"
       target="_blank">David Redwine</a> (D-Shallotte), <a
      href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/house/representative.pl?nUserID=101"
       target="_blank">Greg Thompson</a> (R-Spruce Pine), <a
      href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/house/representative.pl?nUserID=80"
       target="_blank">Warren Oldham</a> (D-Winston-Salem), and <a
      href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/house/representative.pl?nUserID=35"
       target="_blank">Ruth Easterling</a> (D-Charlotte), and
      Senators <a
      href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/senate/senator.pl?nUserID=23"
       target="_blank">Howard Lee</a> (D-Chapel Hill), <a
      href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/senate/senator.pl?nUserID=1"
       target="_blank">Aaron W. Plyler</a> (D-Monroe), and <a
      href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/senate/senator.pl?nUserID=21"
       target="_blank">Fountain Odom</a> (D-Charlotte)-- took
      matters into their own hands and "negotiated a deal" (says
      Redwine) in which they quietly placed the reinstatement of
      circumcision funding into SB 841, the "Budget Technical
      Corrections" bill, a document other senators say is intended
      to correct "very dry details and errors" of the budget.</p>

      <p>The bill was, in the words of <a
      href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/house/representative.pl?nUserID=239"
       target="_blank">Rep. Shubert</a>, a "smorgasbord" of
      unrelated issues that was sure to pass. By the time this
      change was made, the session was all but over. Many
      legislators headed home. Then, at 1:24 p.m. on Dec. 6, SB
      841, including the Medicaid reimbursement for circumcision,
      was passed by only 23 senators--not even half of the Senate.
      The vote took place when 15 senators, including Sen.
      Odom--who had introduced the initial funding cut--were not
      present. Hearing news of the cut, stunned legislators and
      citizens alike were left with the puzzling question: How did
      this happen, and why?</p>

      <p><a
      href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/senate/senator.pl?nUserID=38"
       target="_blank">Sen. Marc Basnight</a> (D-Manteo), President
      Pro Tempore of the North Carolina General Assembly, who
      advised the appropriations chairs to put the funding back in
      the budget, says: "I believe it's important, when possible,
      to allow Medicaid patients the same choice for care that
      patients with private medical insurance receive. To do
      otherwise creates a two-tiered medical system in which those
      who can afford medical insurance have the opportunity to make
      important medical decisions for themselves, while those with
      fewer resources have fewer choices."</p>

      <p>Funding advocates contend that circumcision is an accepted
      procedure and the cultural norm. Therefore low-income parents
      should have the option to choose the procedure at taxpayer
      expense lest their baby boys be "marked" as poor and suffer a
      lifetime of locker-room ridicule as a result.</p>

      <p>Gov. Easley says boys actually need to be circumcised so
      that they may excel unstigmatized.</p>

      <p>"People should not be indelibly branded as economically
      disadvantaged because their parents could not afford this
      simple procedure when they were born," explains Easley in a
      Dec. 20, 2001 letter to concerned constituents who complained
      about the reinstatement. "We have made sacrifices ... and
      begun new education programs to make sure that every child in
      North Carolina has the chance to excel. No child can excel
      when stigmatized."</p>

      <p>Strangely, though, these arguments did not come up while
      the funding cut for circumcision was being considered.
      Legislators report that where there had been none before,
      controversy suddenly arose when the cut took effect in
      November. Even though no medical society in the world
      recommends routine infant circumcision, the push to reinstate
      funding was led entirely by a few doctors. Several sources in
      the legislature, including Sen. Lee, report that calls and
      letters from doctors complaining about the cut started to
      roll in as soon as it went into effect. Various legislators,
      both for and against the funding, confirm that the vast
      majority of communications favoring the funding were from
      doctors and medical lobbyists.</p>

      <p>These doctors, many of whom stand to lose income if the
      surgery isn't paid for by Medicaid, argued that failure to
      provide state funding for circumcision deprived patients of a
      cultural procedure and would create the "two-tier" system.
      Dr. Charles Willson, vice president and president-elect of
      the North Carolina Pediatric Society (NCPS), says the society
      advocated for funding, but not because of money. Members of
      the society are child advocates, he says, who did not want
      poor children to be slighted.</p>

      <p>"We didn't want there to be a situation where people on
      Medicaid who wanted [circumcisions] couldn't get them," he
      says.</p>

      <p>"We didn't want there to be a class division here where
      boys were stigmatized."</p>

      <p>Not all North Carolina doctors hold this viewpoint. Rep.
      Shubert says, "More members of the medical community
      advocated for discontinuing funding than not." In fact, some
      N.C. doctors do not circumcise at all, even if it's requested
      by the parents.</p>

      <p>For men who are grown now, to lack foreskin may be the
      norm. In 20 years, the situation may look very different. If
      Medicaid continues to fund circumcision while the wealthy and
      educated increasingly choose to heed medical societies'
      recommendations against routine circumcision, in a few years
      it may be the poor boys, not the rich, who have been
      circumcised.</p>

      <p>Either way, there's little agreement about whether
      circumcision protects males from a social stigma. "Who do
      they think they are, saying that I'm 'marked'? Most of my
      friends who are circumcised are envious of me," says Devin
      Larkin, a non-circumcised 16-year-old from Statesville. "The
      last thing I'm doing in the locker-room is looking at another
      guy's equipment. And if I did accidentally notice their
      circumcised or uncircumcised status, I certainly wouldn't
      comment on it."</p>

      <p>And given a growing body of medical evidence, the
      discussion of circumcision continues to advance far beyond
      the locker room. Dr. George Denniston, President of <a
      href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/"
      target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision.</a>, says: "We
      [DOC] feel strongly that the foreskin is an integral part of
      the healthy human body. No one has the right to remove it
      except the individual himself."</p>

      <p>Says Tim Hammond, founder of <a
      href="http://www.noharmm.org/" target="_blank">The National
      Organization to Halt the Abuse and Routine Mutilation of
      Males</a> (NOHARMM), circumcision is not a "snip," but the
      removal of a full 15 square inches of sensitive and
      functional tissue. "We have both a right and a responsibility
      to oppose a practice that has harmed us and continues to harm
      innocent children."</p>

      <p>Even now, when to lack a foreskin may indeed be the
      cultural norm for grown men, many men are upset that they
      were circumcised as infants. The <a
      href="http://www.norm.org/" target="_blank">National
      Organization of Restoring Men</a> (NORM), a peer-to-peer
      support organization of circumcised men who desire reversal
      of the cosmetic surgery, has been active for 12 years and
      consists of chapters around the globe.</p>

      <p>In a few years, as more and more parents choose not to
      circumcise and groups like NORM become more active, it may be
      common for circumcised males to take legal action. Bill
      Stewart, a retired <a href="http://www.unc.edu/"
      target="_blank">UNC-Chapel Hill</a> law professor, believes
      there is "an excellent chance" that such men will have legal
      recourse, and that this is part of the reason medical
      societies are now recommending against the procedure.</p>

      <p>"They are beginning to realize that it's unethical to
      cosmetically cut nonconsenting infants' genitals," he says,
      "and they also realize that these children, when they grow
      up, might turn around and sue them." "It will take a long
      time to have people's rights vindicated," says Stewart, "but
      it will happen."</p>

      <p>Currently, the legislature has again proposed to cut
      circumcision funding through Medicaid. But given the medical
      lobby's political clout and connections to Gov. Easley, the
      battle lines could again be drawn between the legislature's
      need to trim the budget and doctors' hopes to protect their
      incomes.</p>

      <p>Dr. Kenneth Baker, past chairman of obstetrics and
      pediatrics at Union County Regional Medical Center, a fellow
      of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,
      and Medical Director of the <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/">National Organization of
      Circumcision Information Resource Centers</a>, says, "I just
      spoke to a pediatrician who said he only does it because it's
      easy money. It's $150 to $175 for less than five minutes'
      work. It doesn't get any better than that."</p>

      <p>Dr. Oliver in Sylva agrees: "The doctors I hear are
      screaming that they have lost income by this ban."</p>

      <p>In fact, recent data indicate that states whose Medicaid
      programs pay doctors more than $60 per circumcision have
      almost twice as high a circumcision rate as states that pay
      under $50. North Carolina pays about $200. (The national
      average is about $85.) Here, where one out of every two
      pregnant women (and their babies) is on Medicaid, one quick
      circumcision per week would increase a physician's income by
      about $10,000 a year.</p>

      <p>Dr. Willson with the N.C. Pediatric Society maintains that
      money is not the real issue when it comes to circumcision,
      it's choice. "Basically, all of us would like to have people
      not ask for circumcision--it's not medically necessary, but
      at this point, many people want that. Until parents stop
      asking for it, I think we oughta do it."</p>

      <p>To those who "do it," the state continues to pay. But <a
      href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/house/representative.pl?nUserID=88">
      Rep. Redwine</a> insists, "In no way did the medical
      community [financially] influence the decision to reinstate
      Medicaid funding for circumcision."</p>

      <p>During the 2000 election cycle, the <a
      href="http://www.ncmedsoc.org/" target="_blank">North
      Carolina Medical Society</a> gave a total of $12,500 to the
      legislators who ended up protecting circumcision funding. The
      N.C. OB-GYN PAC also made contributions to many of them. Rep.
      Redwine received $18,750 in contributions from the health
      sector, nearly 15 percent of the financing for his campaign.
      Sen. Plyler received more than $21,000 from the health
      sector, and Sen. Lee received nearly $33,000.</p>

      <p>Money aside, the most powerful political force behind
      circumcision funding was clearly Gov. Easley. Legislators
      report that in addition to the appeals from a few doctors,
      pressure to reinstate funding came from the governor's office
      as well. Amy Fulk, spokeswoman for <a
      href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/senate/senator.pl?nUserID=38"
       target="_blank">Sen. Basnight</a>, says the governor spoke
      with legislative leaders who then communicated his wishes to
      the appropriations subcommittee.</p>

      <p>"The governor really pushed for this," says Fulk. Gov.
      Easley's press secretary, Fred Hartman, confirms that Easley
      took measures to have funding reinstated. Upon hearing of the
      funding cut, says Hartman, Easley "instructed the [Department
      of Health and Human Services] to find a way to put it
      back."</p>

      <p>Which raises the question of why the governor would have
      wanted this specific, unrecommended procedure to be funded at
      a time when he vowed to leave no stone unturned in the quest
      to cut unnecessary spending. Hartman says it was mainly
      because "cutting that funding adversely affected low-income
      families."</p>

      <p>He continues: "It was a much-needed service, and a very
      nominal amount--one that we could restore easily." The
      governor himself expressed reasoning that people's intact
      penises would create a state "divided by social and class
      lines."</p>

      <p>For Easley, it's family ties that connect him to the
      issue. He has two brothers who are obstetricians. One, Dr.
      Henry Alexander Easley, practices in North Carolina. The <a
      href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/"
      target="_blank">governor's office</a> admits Easley received
      counsel from his brother, who, says Communications Director
      Cari Boyce, "made him aware of the medical society's concerns
      about this issue." Boyce says the medical society argued that
      the cost of doing circumcisions is less than the cost of
      treating the diseases that might occur later if one doesn't
      circumcise. However, the society, (and any assistant
      researching and advising the governor on this decision), must
      surely have been aware that the AMA has denounced
      circumcision's value as a preventive practice.</p>

      <p>A look at the governor's campaign finance report offers
      some other, significant insight into his motivations for
      pushing this isolated funding. During the 2000 election
      cycle, the health sector donated more $661,000 in
      contributions to Easley's campaign.</p>

      <p>If only the state were as generous to those seeking
      affordable health care. The governor's 2002 budget plan cuts
      $228.9 million in funding for <a
      href="http://www.dhhs.state.nc.us/" target="_blank">Health
      and Human Services</a> (the department that oversees
      Medicaid), by slashing funding for (among other things)
      mental health services, the Smart Start program (day care,
      immunizations, etc.), services for the disabled, women and
      children's public health, rural primary care clinics, and
      health care access for low-income individuals. Will the state
      once again go along with Easley's wish to maintain funding
      for an unnecessary surgery while denying many individuals
      access to basic care? How many other primary medical services
      will be cut while N.C. taxes continue to fund
      circumcisions?</p>

      <p>In 2002, we will find out.</p>
