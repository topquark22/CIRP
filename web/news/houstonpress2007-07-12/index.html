            <h4>The Fantastic Foreskin</h4>

            <h2>Circumcised men are employing weights and pulleys
            to cover themselves back up</h2>

            <p>By <b>Craig Malisow</b><br />
             Published: July 12, 2007</p>

            <p>"I'm wearing it right now," John Long says. "But I
            didn't wear it most of the day yesterday."<br />
            <br />
             Subject(s): foreskin restoration, circumcision<br />
            <br />
             The 27-year-old bookstore employee is talking about
            the device attached to his circumcised penis, beneath
            his clothes. Picture a miniature silicone lampshade
            with a handle on the wide end. It's cupping the head of
            his johnson, and the skin of the shaft is pulled
            forward over it. An elastic band runs from the handle
            to a knee brace, applying constant tension to the skin
            on the penis, stretching it forward, coaxing it to
            grow.</p>

               and pulleys to cover themselves back up
            </center>

            <p>The device can pinch or get bunched up at times, but
            overall, it's an effective vehicle for Long's mission,
            which is to create a faux-foreskin out of existing
            shaft skin. The device is called the TLC Tugger, and
            Long bought it online from its inventor, an engineer in
            suburban Chicago. The Tugger's motto is: Improving the
            world, one penis at a time.</p>

              at a time.
            </center>

            <p>Long's wife, Melissa, discovered the site after the
            subject of circumcision came up on an online parenting
            forum. When one guy introduced himself by saying he was
            restoring his foreskin, Melissa was intrigued. She did
            some research on her own, finding that there were many
            different contraptions out there. The TLC Tugger Web
            site jumped out at her for one simple reason: It
            features an instructional video, with the inventor
            stuffing his junk into the lamp shades. (Melissa's
            initial reaction describes it best: "I cannot believe
            this guy is putting this thing on his thing.")<br />
            <br />
             But what started out as an amusement for the couple
            soon turned serious. They felt their eyes opening to
            the allegations on the anti-circumcision Web sites:
            Decreased sensitivity among cut men; "mutilation" in
            general; sexual partners of uncircumcised men raving
            about the superiority of "intact" guys.<br />
            <br />
             "I got kind of pissed off," John says. "The more I
            learned, the more angry I got."<br />
            <br />
             His anger is shared by quite a few. Since there is
            virtually no effective procedure to surgically restore
            foreskin (see "<a
            href="/news/houstonpress2007-07-12a/">Under the
            Knife</a>"), Long and others have had to find
            alternatives - which ultimately don't restore foreskin
            at all, but give some "restorers" the feeling they are
            making themselves whole.<br />
            <br />
             Since the dawn of the modern restoring movement in the
            early '80s, thousands of men have attached what look
            like Inquisition-era torture devices to their privates
            in order to reclaim what they feel was butchered at
            birth. Progress is slow and the equipment is
            embarrassingly cumbersome, but proponents say it is
            worth it.<br />
            <br />
             The anti-circ community got the sad news February 13:
            Clifford Spooner, a pioneer in the restoration
            movement, died of cancer in Washington state. According
            to the obit on the International Coalition for Genital
            Integrity's Web site, Spooner cofounded Brothers United
            for Future Foreskin (BUFF) in 1982.<br />
            <br />
             Spooner's disdain for circumcision sparked when his
            mother had him circumcised at age ten, according to the
            obit - which does not state the reason for the delayed
            procedure.<br />
            <br />
             Spooner would grow up to advocate, along with his
            compatriots at BUFF, a restoration method whereby the
            skin of the shaft is stretched over the head and taped
            in place. (In cases where the tape wouldn't stick, BUFF
            suggested, you could "paint the skin with tincture of
            benzoin, which is also known as friar's balsam").<br />
            <br />
             Ten years later, BUFF was eclipsed by the San
            Francisco-based <a href="http://www.norm.org"
            target="_blank">National Organization for the
            Restoration of Men</a> and other anti-circ sites,
            perhaps due in part to BUFF's debunking the importance
            of penile hygiene: "Contrary to the old wives' tale, it
            is not necessary to wash the penis every day."<br />
            <br />
             But the term "foreskin restoration" is misleading,
            since all these men are doing is stretching existing
            shaft skin.<br />
            <br />
             A quick aside for Foreskin 101 (in a nutshell): The <a
            href="/library/anatomy/cold-taylor/">foreskin</a> is an
            elastic sheath consisting of an outer layer of
            "regular" skin and an inner layer of mucous membrane,
            like the underside of the eyelid. The foreskin keeps
            the glans covered and lubricated, and retracts when the
            penis is erect. "Intactivists" believe <a
            href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">the foreskin is rich in
            nerve endings that are severed upon circumcision</a>.
            The debate over the merits of circumcision doesn't
            exist only among the general public - many doctors are
            divided on the subject, battling each other with
            studies that take opposing views on circumcision's
            protection against HIV, cancer, urinary tract
            infections and other problems.<br />
            <br />
             In 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a
            <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/">policy
            statement on circumcision</a> that was also adopted by
            the American Medical Association: "Existing scientific
            evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of
            newborn male circumcision; however, these data are not
            sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision.
            In circumstances in which there are potential benefits
            and risks, yet the procedure is not essential to the
            child's current well-being, parents should determine
            what is in the best interest of the child." (Because of
            doctors' general lack of interest in foreskin
            restoration, there do not appear to be any studies on
            the efficacy of restored foreskin warding off
            disease).<br />
            <br />
             Today, restoring men have opportunities for support
            that Spooner and the old guard probably couldn't
            imagine - forums such as <a
            href="http://www.foreskin-restoration.net"
            target="_blank">www.foreskin-restoration.net</a>, where
            guys can debate the efficacy of different products, ask
            tough questions ("Does anyone have experience tugging
            while going through airport security?") and post
            pictures of their progress. Most restorers measure
            progress via the coverage index ("CI"), a standard
            whereby cut men can measure the amount of any existing
            foreskin they may have at the beginning of the
            restoration process and the amount of the foreskin
            during and after the process. Determining one's CI
            number requires one to spend a considerable amount of
            time studying photographs of flaccid and erect penises.
            In fact, any serious restorer not only examines
            dick-shots as if they were painted on the Sistine
            Chapel, he discusses every nanometer of his knob in
            incredible detail. Nothing is out of bounds. It's a
            place where one man can tell another man, "Looking at
            my circumcision scar when erect, you can see that there
            is almost twice as much skin on the bottom as the top"
            and nothing bad happens.<br />
            <br />
             This open-mindedness comes in handy for those looking
            to build, rather than buy, restoration devices. More
            than a few restorers appear to be natural MacGyvers, to
            wit: "Currently, I'm using a one-inch-diameter pipe
            coupling with all [of] the inside covered with aquarium
            sealant."<br />
            <br />
             Obviously, if someone's going to slather a pipe in
            aquarium sealant and tie it to his penis, he should
            have a good reason. And most of the restoring men
            contacted for this story say they have one of the best
            reasons of all: They believe they were mutilated for a
            myth, denied full sexual pleasure, and completely
            violated.<br />
            <br />
             For some, it's a late awakening. Guerin Woodgate Jr.,
            29, says he never thought much about his circumcision
            until he stumbled upon some anti-circ Web sites about
            ten years ago.<br />
            <br />
             "As soon as I started reading the information, I
            suddenly felt like I was missing something that was
            important to me," he says, "and immediately felt
            compelled to start finding a way to get it back."<br />
            <br />
             Woodgate, an IT consultant, says he sought advice from
            urologists, who brushed him aside, so he dived into
            nonsurgical restoration methods. The first technique he
            tried was a relatively common one among novice
            restorers, partly because it involves ordinary
            materials: one empty film canister (35-mm), batteries
            (size C, in Woodgate's case), a suspender-type strap,
            tape and a binder clip.</p>

            <center>
              <img src="fantasticforeskin3.jpg"
              alt="Geurin Woodgate" /><br />
               After spending $1000 on different devices,<br />
               Woodgate settled on medical-grade tape.
            </center>

            <p>Woodgate cut out the bottom of the film canister,
            making a tube, and punched a hole in one side, so he
            could have one hook end of the binder clip sticking
            out. He then inserted the head of his penis into the
            canister, rolled the skin from his shaft over the tube,
            taped it in place, and attached a strap weighted with
            two batteries (taped together) to the binder
            clip.<br />
            <br />
             Sure, it may sound like fun, but Woodgate soon ran
            into problems.<br />
            <br />
             "Actually, inserting your penis is quite difficult
            inside of a film canister," he says. "You look at a
            film canister and you think, 'that's pretty big
            around.' And you don't realize, actually, the natural
            diameter of a penis and how large in diameter it really
            is until, even flaccid, you try to insert your penis
            inside this thing. Rolling the skin over was very
            difficult, especially because of the lack of skin that
            I had."<br />
            <br />
             Next up was the PUD (Penile Uncircumcising Device)
            Tugger, sold by a company called American Bodycrafters
            and advertised as "the most sophisticated foreskin
            restoration product to date." The PUD is essentially a
            stainless-steel cylinder worn over the glans, with
            shaft skin taped around it. Like the canister method,
            the PUD includes a hook to hold additional weights.
            Another benefit, according to one PUD sales site: "All
            of our products come with a urinary passage so removal
            during urination is not necessary." (For those who want
            to lengthen the penis while restoring the foreskin,
            American Bodycrafters sells something called the
            VacuTrac, which looks like it violates the Geneva
            Convention.)<br />
            <br />
             But, also like the canister method, the PUD didn't
            work for Woodgate. He says it was effective, but
            awkward.<br />
            <br />
             "By the time you put this thing on - it's 16 ounces -
            and you start to walk around, it moves around in your
            pants leg," he says, "and people think, 'Man, that man
            has a long penis'...And that's not really my deal. I'm
            not trying to advertise this."<br />
            <br />
             After flushing an estimated $1,000 down the drain,
            Woodgate ultimately decided he liked the simplest
            method of all: a two-inch strip of medical-grade tape.
            All he does is pull his shaft skin forward and tape it
            in place. While it's certainly a lot less cumbersome
            than tubes and batteries, the tape method also takes a
            lot longer to yield significant results. Woodgate
            believes he'll have to wear tape for 20 years before he
            reaches his ideal CI number. But the simple act helps
            instill something he believes his circumcision stripped
            him of &ndash; control over his own body.<br />
            <br />
             "I [felt] like something was taken away...I actually
            had a sense of anger," he says. "And it wasn't anger
            towards anyone, it was just, I was angry about the
            situation, that there was absolutely nothing I could
            do. I couldn't reverse it." He adds later: "I can
            control so much in my life, and that was one thing I
            could not control, I could not change."<br />
            <br />
             Like other restorers, Woodgate says that keeping the
            glans covered - a function of natural foreskin - has
            made it more sensitive. Here's something he suggests
            circumcised guys do: "If you go into the bathroom, take
            your pants down and take a good look at your penis. If
            you've been circumcised and you're 20 years or older,
            the head of your penis...will appear to be somewhat dry
            and calcified. And the older that you get, the more
            calcified...the head of your penis is, rubbing inside
            of your briefs or boxers. And so what happens is, the
            skin's own mechanism is to naturally harden the
            skin...."<br />
            <br />
             But now that his glans is covered most of the time,
            "It's like the difference between touching the hands of
            a baby and touching the hands of a 30-year-old
            man."<br />
            <br />
             And while taping your penis every day might seem like
            a chore, Woodgate says it's just like any other part of
            a person's normal routine.<br />
            <br />
             "You don't even think about it - you brush your teeth,
            you comb your hair," he says, "Well, I cut a two-inch
            long piece of tape and put it on my penis and go. And
            it takes me all of ten seconds."<br />
            <br />
             Woodgate says his boyfriend, who is circumcised, has
            been supportive of the restoration. It may have taken
            him a little time to get used to it, Woodgate says, but
            the couple is now at the point where Woodgate's
            boyfriend pre-cuts pieces of tape Woodgate can carry in
            his shaving kit when he travels.<br />
            <br />
             While Woodgate says he's committed to using tape for
            the next 20 years, he wishes he could find a doctor
            willing to investigate the possibilities of true
            foreskin restorations. He'd like organ donation to
            include foreskin, for skin grafts that could do a whole
            lot more than tape or batteries.<br />
            <br />
             <b>He's going to be waiting a while.</b><br />
            <br />
             The study of foreskin sensitivity has not been a
            priority among most physicians.<br />
            <br />
             Because conventional American medical wisdom has
            historically decided circumcision reduced the chance of
            infection and was more hygienic overall, whether
            foreskin made sex more pleasurable just did not seem
            important.<br />
            <br />
             But some physicians are convinced of the foreskin's
            extreme sensitivity - none more so than the members of
            the Seattle-based <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>. This
            advocacy group claimed a victory when its members
            coauthored a recent study that concluded &ndash; big
            surprise here &ndash; that uncircumcised men have more
            sensitive penises.<br />
            <br />
             Published in the April 2007 issue of the <i>British
            Journal of Urology</i>, the <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/pdf/sorrells_2007.pdf"
             target="_blank">study</a> measured the sensitivity of
            159 cut and uncut men with "Semmes-Weinstein
            monofilament touch-test sensory evaluators," which is a
            fancy way of saying the doctors tickled the dudes' junk
            with fishing line. (Under the journal's "conflict of
            interest" section, it reads "none declared." This is
            followed by the fact that the study was funded by the
            <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/"
            target="_blank">National Organization of Circumcision
            Information Resource Centers</a>, which seems fine, as
            long as no one looks at the group's acronym.)<br />
            <br />
             The doctors claimed to have mapped the "fine-touch
            pressure thresholds" of cut and uncut penises - after
            controlling for things like type of underwear worn and
            education level, of course. In all, 19 pressure points
            were identified, and these were the portions removed or
            otherwise affected by circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             Besides a critique of the study in the June 2007 issue
            of the BJU, the study seems to have been largely
            ignored. It appears that doctors just aren't that
            interested in foreskin. Most of the physicians
            interviewed for this story - well, at least the ones
            who returned phone calls - thought the idea of foreskin
            restoration was, A: stupid; B: delusional; C: both of
            the above.<br />
            <br />
             Houston plastic surgeon <a
            href="http://www.dr-powell.yourmd.com/"
            target="_blank">Berkeley Powell</a>, past president of
            the <a href="http://www.tsps.net/Home.asp"
            target="_blank">Texas Society of Plastic Surgeons</a>,
            said with a bit of a chuckle, "I'm sitting here just
            kind of amazed. I didn't know this was going on. But I
            read your paper - this is what I read it for, to stay
            abreast of current events."<br />
            <br />
             Powell reiterated the fact that restorers weren't
            actually restoring anything, but added: "More power to
            'em for trying."<br />
            <br />
             <a href="http://www.bcm.edu/urology/?pmid=4899"
            target="_blank">Michael Coburn</a>, chief of urology at
            <a
            href="http://www.hchdonline.com/about/facilities/bentaubgh.htm"
             target="_blank">Ben Taub</a> and a professor at <a
            href="http://www.bcm.edu" target="_blank">Baylor</a>,
            was surprised to hear about nonsurgical restoration:
            "Why are these people wanting to do that?"<br />
            <br />
             As far as uncircumcised men having greater
            sensitivity, Coburn says, "There's not really any <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/pdf/sorrells_2007.pdf"
             target="_blank">medical evidence</a> to support
            that."<br />
            <br />
             Still, many restoring men claim that the process has
            enhanced sex for both themselves and their partners.
            This concept was even the thesis for a book written by
            the wife of a restoring man, <i>Sex as Nature Intended
            It</i>. Author Kristen O'Hara cites a survey she
            conducted claiming that women prefer uncut men nine to
            one. O'Hara's <a
            href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com"
            target="_blank">Web site</a> for the book includes
            testimonies from herself and other (unidentified) women
            who liken sex with a circumcised man to being pounded
            with a jackhammer, while uncut men are more gentle and
            responsive. As supporting evidence, she includes
            alleged testimony from a woman who writes that her
            first sexual experience involved a guy lying down
            beside her at a beach, spontaneously masturbating and
            then raping her. Her next sexual experience, a year
            later, was a pleasant romp with an uncircumcised man
            who did not rape her. Case closed.<br />
            <br />
             Melissa Long swears that sex is better now that her
            husband is restoring. Previously, she says, sex had
            always been painful.<br />
            <br />
             "It was almost like a relief to me to know that there
            wasn't something wrong with me," she says, later
            adding, "He's more sensitive, so he doesn't have to,
            like, thrust as hard - there doesn't have to be as much
            friction for him to get the sensation, so it's
            gentler." In an e-mail, she likened the
            before-and-after experiences to "going from watching TV
            on an old black-and-white set to a digital Technicolor
            plasma screen with surround sound."<br />
            <br />
             Enhanced sex has been especially rewarding to Keith
            Akers, who started restoring about five years
            ago.<br />
            <br />
             "I credit the restoration with the fact that I now
            have a 17-month-old son - who, by the way, was not
            circumcised," says the 47-year-old Atascocita
            man.<br />
            <br />
             Akers started restoring with the help of an O-ring and
            now uses the TLC Tugger, with great results. The proof
            is in the penis: Akers says he's gone from less than 1
            on the CI scale to a 3.5. His goal is to have "full
            coverage" when he's erect.</p>

               Akers says he more than tripled his CI number.

            <p>While the promise of better sex was his primary
            motivation to restore, Akers mentions an added
            benefit.<br />
            <br />
             "Part of it was to make myself different from what my
            dad is," he says, adding later, "It was something that
            I did for myself because I have no relationship with my
            dad to speak of at all...at the time that all of this
            started, I...finally came to grip with some things and
            I got some treatment for some chronic depression and
            with the family issues...this was another thing that
            kind of helped me feel better about myself and to kind
            of set a little distance between me and the way I
            viewed some of the problems."<br />
            <br />
             He also understands what brings others to the
            restoring community: "A lot of the guys on these Web
            sites, they really feel violated, that something was
            torn away from them. I don't feel that as strongly...as
            they do about it, but I can see their point. And I can
            agree with them."<br />
            <br />
             Ron Low remembers the moment he decided to restore the
            way someone might remember a wedding anniversary.<br />
            <br />
             About ten years ago, Low (sounds like "cow") noticed
            his libido was flat-lining. Sex just wasn't what it
            used to be.<br />
            <br />
             "For me, intimacy just wasn't getting any better. It
            was getting worse. And at the same time, it was getting
            better for my wife. You know, here we are approaching
            40, and I felt like...'I can't believe nature is so
            cruel that intimacy would just get worse and worse and
            this is all I have to look forward to.'"<br />
            <br />
             He found some information about restoring online, and
            then came that magic moment: "It was April 1, 2001, at
            about nine o'clock in the evening," he says, speaking
            on the phone from the Chicago suburb of Northbrook. He
            and his wife "were sitting in front of the TV set and I
            said, 'Hon, I've got to tell you about something. I'm
            going to start applying tape to my penis every day
            because I want to stretch my skin and make a new
            foreskin grow.' And she said, 'Well, that's crazy.
            That's ridiculous.' And I had to look her straight in
            the eye and tell her I was deadly serious. 'It's not
            crazy, and I'm going to need your support, dear.'" And
            she's been supportive ever since.<br />
            <br />
             Low started with the film canister method, but used
            his training as an engineer to design a new device -
            what turned out to be the TLC Tugger. He says he
            secretly tested it on himself, not wanting to announce
            his invention until he knew it worked. Even his mother,
            who lives next door, did not know her son was walking
            around constantly stretching the skin of his
            penis.<br />
            <br />
             "For a long time she would see me wearing shorts and
            notice a knee brace on one leg, which was there to
            conceal the tugging straps, and she would express
            concern about my poor knee," he says. "I usually just
            said I strained it."<br />
            <br />
             But after 21 months' tugging time, his libido
            rejuvenated, he offered his device on eBay. There was
            immediate interest, but he hadn't actually made any
            more because he wasn't sure if anyone would actually
            want to buy any.<br />
            <br />
             He started making the molds for the Tugger's two cones
            in the family kitchen, but, with the greater demand, he
            now has a "dedicated lab oven" in his basement, with
            the capability of making about 12 Tuggers a day.<br />
            <br />
             Low moderates an online Tugger user group, which he
            launched last fall and which now has 1,000 members. He
            says he ships the product all around the world. (Per
            his Web site, he offers "free shipping to Israel,
            Muslim states and third-world nations where ritual
            mutilation of children occurs.")<br />
            <br />
             He looks forward to the day when the Tugger and other
            restoration devices are sold at the local drugstore.
            Until then, he's just one dude making dick-cones in his
            basement. The device hasn't made him rich, but none of
            the people selling restoring devices online appear to
            be in it for the money. They appear to be genuinely
            interested in helping other guys feel at peace with
            their penises.<br />
            <br />
             Guys like John Long, who admits that, since his second
            child - a son - was born seven months ago, he's been
            too busy to wear the Tugger consistently.<br />
            <br />
             "People going to get into it...you need to be
            committed to it: It can be a long haul," he says. He's
            happy with the results he's seen so far, but a little
            bitter that he has to go through the process in the
            first place.<br />
            <br />
             His wife describes it best in an e-mail: "When our son
            was born in December, we left him intact. For the first
            few months, during diaper changes, my husband would
            look at our little boy and shake his head, saying
            'Lucky little bastard.' But we know that by the time
            our son is old enough to know the difference, his dad
            will look like him, too!"</p>
