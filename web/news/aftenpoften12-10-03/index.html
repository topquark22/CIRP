            <h2>Damages for surprise circumcision</h2>

            <p>A man who woke up in a Molde [Norway] hospital and
            found himself the recipient of an unexpected
            circumcision has been awarded NOK 20,000 (USD 3,000) in
            compensation from the surgeon, newspaper
            Sunnm&oslash;rsposten reports.</p>

            <p>Frostating Court of Appeals ruled that the physician
            in charge of was negligent for not reading the man's
            journal before the operation, and found the result of
            the surgery constituted injury.</p>

            <p>The patient told the court that he would never have
            embarked on surgery to relieve an uncomfortably tight
            foreskin if he had known a circumcision would
            result.</p>

            <p>The man claimed that the circumcision had destroyed
            his sex life by <span class="yellow">reducing the
            sensitivity of his penis</span> and because he was now
            embarrassed to appear naked in front of his wife. He
            said he was also embarrassed to be naked in public
            bathing facilities now.</p>

            <p>The man originally sued both the hospital owner and
            the doctor but lost, then changed his appeal to
            concentrate on suing the doctor.</p>

            <p>The surgeon said in his defense that at least 60
            percent of American men are circumcised and that the
            procedure is routine for Jewish and Muslim babies. He
            also argued that the man was objectively better after
            the operation and he had been warned that the foreskin
            could be partially or completely removed.</p>

            <p>The appeals court chose to believe that the
            resulting circumcision came as a shock to the patient,
            and ruled he had suffered damage, though not
            'considerable' damage.</p>

            <p>The court also ruled that circumcision remains
            unusual in Norway and that the physical changes to the
            man's organ were self-evident.</p>
