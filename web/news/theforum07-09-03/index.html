             The Forum - 07/09/2003</p>

            <p>The attorney who failed to prove negligence in last
            winter's high-profile <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare</a> circumcision case has
            asked for a new trial.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a> of <a
            href="http://www.hawley.govoffice.com/"
            target="_blank">Hawley</a> said excluded evidence and
            improper jury instructions ruined his chances for
            success.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.co.cass.nd.us/"
            target="_blank">A Cass County</a> District Court jury
            in February ruled <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734"
             target="_blank">Dr. Sunita Kantak</a> was not
            negligent in explaining the risks of circumcision to
            Anita Flatt for her newborn son, Josiah.</p>

            <p>But those jurors, culled from a society largely
            ignorant of the surgery, weren't allowed to see
            circumcision videos or tools, putting the plaintiffs at
            an unfair disadvantage, Baer said Tuesday.</p>

            <p>I was stuck trying to educate the jury through a
            freehand drawing, he said.</p>

            <p>The hindrance was one of several Baer pointed out to
            <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/COURT/DISTRICTS/EC.HTM"
             target="_blank">East Central District</a> Judge <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/Rothe-Seeger.htm"
             target="_blank">Cynthia Rothe-Seeger</a> during an
            hour-long presentation. Among other complaints, Baer
            cited jury instruction he called misleading, inaccurate
            and prejudicial.</p>

            <p>In one instance, Baer said, experts from both sides
            agreed that for an elective procedure such as
            circumcision, all risks, no matter how small, should be
            disclosed to the patient or the patient's guardian.</p>

            <p>Despite this agreement, he said, Rothe-Seeger
            instructed the jury in terms of a medical procedure,
            for which a doctor must inform a patient only of
            serious and likely risks.</p>

            <p>Those are diametrically opposed concepts, Baer
            said.</p>

            <p>In her response, MeritCare attorney <a
            href="http://www.vogellaw.com/fsl5cs/XMLAttorneyProfile.asp?guid=I30B624CE1DD211B2A40BB0001207C554&amp;ind_wld_id=3185802"
             target="_blank">Angela Lord</a> said Baer's excluded
            evidence was irrelevant to the case.</p>

            <p>The question at trial was whether or not Kantak
            sufficiently informed Flatt of the procedure, Lord
            said, not the legitimacy of circumcision.</p>

            <p>During her closing argument in the February trial,
            MeritCare attorney <a
            href="http://www.vogellaw.com/fsl5cs/XMLAttorneyProfile.asp?guid=I1D0AB9301DD211B28BAB4D00E205CACF&amp;ind_wld_id=1286278"
             target="_blank">Jane Voglewede</a> said Flatt
            acknowledged talking to Kantak before the procedure,
            reading the informed-consent sheet and signing the
            sheet.</p>

            <p>On Tuesday Lord said Flatt, who was not at the
            hearing, was responsible after her March 1997 birth for
            asking Kantak to clarify any confusion she had about
            the surgery.</p>

            <p>There was simply no error or irregularity in this
            trial, she told Rothe- Seeger.</p>

            <p>Lord also disputed Baer's version of how the experts
            agreed about the informed consent procedure for
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>Thats simply inaccurate, she said.</p>

            <p>Baer, an attorney for 23 years, got involved in
            circumcision cases in the mid- 90s when he filed an
            unsuccessful suit in federal court.</p>

            <p>He has accused hospitals of perpetuating the
            surgery, which he says has no medical benefits, by not
            fully informing parents about the procedure.</p>

            <p>Rothe-Seeger took his motion for a new trial under
            consideration and will issue her decision in
            writing.</p>

            <p>If the motion fails, Baer likely will appeal the
            decision to the state <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/"
            target="_blank">Supreme Court</a>, he said.</p>
