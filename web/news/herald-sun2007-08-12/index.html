            <p><b>CIRCUMCISION will be banned in Victorian public
            hospitals unless it is for medical reasons.</b><br />
            <br />
             State Government has ordered the ban, which starts
            next month, following medical advice that circumcision
            of baby boys was unnecessary.<br />
            <br />
             Health Minister <a
            href="http://www.alpvictoria.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=32"
             target="_blank">Daniel Andrews</a> said circumcisions
            would be performed only when doctors were concerned
            about infection or disease.<br />
            <br />
             "Nationally and overseas, doctors agree there is no
            medical benefit to routine circumcision, and studies
            show the complication rate is about 5 per cent,"<br />
            <br />
             Mr Andrews said. The $2 million a year saved by the
            ban will be spent on urgent elective surgery.<br />
            <br />
             "It is important to ensure hospital services are
            prioritised towards treating patients who have a
            clinical need for surgery to improve their health," Mr
            Andrews said.<br />
            <br />
             Ministerial Advisory Committee on Elective Surgery
            chairman Prof Michael Grigg said it was hard to justify
            spending taxpayers' money on routine
            circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             "We should be spending relatively scarce health
            dollars as effectively as we can to benefit the maximum
            number of people," he said.<br />
            <br />
             Prof Grigg said circumcision had marginal health
            benefits for some people, but also had a risk of
            complication.<br />
            <br />
             About 2200 circumcisions were performed by Victorian
            public hospitals in the 2005-06 financial year.<br />
            <br />
             Parents who want to have their sons circumcised for
            religious reasons will have to use a private
            hospital.</p>
