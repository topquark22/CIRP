            <h4>The issues surrounding routine circumcision</h4>

            <p>By Marie Carisa U. Ordinario</p>

            <p>"Supot!" shouted a newly circumcised young boy to
            one of his "uncut" peers, while wincing at the pain
            brought about by his newfound manhood. His "uncut"
            friend was now running off with tears streaming down
            his face.</p>

            <p>This is a usual scenario come summer time when most
            young Filipino boys earn their "manhood" through
            routine circumcision. Those who are "cut" boast of
            their "manliness," while those who are yet to
            experience the "right of passage" are left embarrassed
            by their condition, anxious for their time to come.</p>

            <p>A predominantly Catholic country, circumcision in
            the Philippines has long become an obligation and a
            tradition. Following Christian doctrine, Filipinos
            believe that circumcision is a symbol of the covenant
            between man and God. Nobody dared question the
            practice.</p>

            <p>Today, however, doctors are debating on the purpose
            of a practice that has become a fixture in Philippine
            tradition, regardless of medical benefits and
            risks.</p>

            <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The medical information
            provided in the next section is remarkably inaccurate.
            Readers are urged to not rely on this information.]</p>

            <p><b>Reasons for circumcision</b></p>

            <p>There are three main reasons why doctors continue
            endorsing routine circumcision: For hygienic purposes;
            religious reasons and to avoid foreskin problems
            (phimosis, paraphimosis and balanitis) in susceptible
            males and cervical cancer in women.</p>

            <p>Hygiene is an important consideration in
            circumcision. Before and after circumcision, <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/hygiene/">proper
            hygiene</a> must be observed. For still uncircumcised
            males, this means that there needs to be a more tedious
            cleaning process to maintain the cleanliness of the
            foreskin. They need to do so to make sure that unwanted
            bacteria and other foreign microbes do not enter the
            spout of the skin and breed. Unless cleaned, there are
            a host of possible infections that can ensue in males
            such as phimosis, paraphimosis and balanitis and
            cervical cancer in their female partners.</p>

            <p>Phimosis is the inability of an individual to
            retract the penis. According to the article <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/">Conservative
            Treatment of Phimosis: Alternatives to Radical
            Circumcision</a> (www.cirp.org), it "occurs in less
            than two percent of intact males," or seven out of
            10,000 males.</p>

            <p>Additional information is given by the article
            Foreskin Problems by Dr. Paul A. Alleyne for E Medicine
            (www.emedicine.com), which states that phimosis is
            caused by infection, poor hygiene, previous foreskin
            injury, any condition or activity that results in
            prolonged foreskin retraction, improper circumcision of
            the penis, catheterization, and vigorous sexual
            activity, including masturbation.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the article Phimosis and Paraphimosis
            written by Dr. Santos Cantu Jr., also for E Medicine,
            defined paraphimosis as the "entrapment of a retracted
            foreskin behind the coronal sulcus." Like phimosis,
            paraphimosis also "occurs in the uncircumcised or
            incorrectly circumcised penis."</p>

            <p>According to Urology Channel (<a
            href="http://www.urologychannel.com/"
            target="_blank">www.urologychannel.com</a>), <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/paraphimosis/">
            paraphimosis</a> occurs in one percent of males over 16
            years of age. This is usually caused by bacterial
            infection, catheterization (i.e., if the foreskin is
            not returned to its original position after a urethral
            catheter is inserted, the glans penis may become
            swollen, which can set off paraphimosis), poor hygiene,
            a swelling producing injury and vigorous sexual
            intercourse.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/balanitis/">balanitis</a>
            is the inflammation of the head of the penis (glans
            penis).</p>

            <p>According to Dr. Mark Leber in his E Medicine
            article Balanitis (<a target="_blank"
            href="http://www.emedicine.com/">www.emedicine.com</a>),
            Balanitis is "a common condition affecting 11 percent
            of adult men, treated in urology clinics, and three
            percent of children."</p>

            <p>Diabetes is also considered as one of the "most
            common underlying conditions associated with
            balanitis." There are also cases when a
            balanitis-complaining patient suffers from uncontrolled
            diabetes, so that retraction of the foreskin cannot be
            done.</p>

            <p>Other causes of balanitis include poor personal
            hygiene, the use of chemical irritants like soap and
            petroleum jelly, Edematous conditions like congestive
            heart failure, cirrhosis and nephrosis, drug allergies,
            morbid obesity, penile cancer and viruses such as
            candidal species (most commonly associated with
            diabetes), anaerobic infection, human papilloma virus
            (HPV), gardnerella vaginalis, treponema pallidum
            (syphilis), trichomonal species, group B streptococci
            and borrelia vincentii.</p>

            <p>In addition, Dr. Clayton Blas, a urologist and
            member of the <a href="http://puanet.org/"
            target="_blank">Philippine Urological Association</a>,
            said that circumcision also aims to prevent <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/">cervical
            cancer</a> in women. The HPV is a common sexually
            transmitted disease that is passed on from one partner
            to another through sexual intercourse. According to the
            National Cancer Institute's website (<a
            href="http://cis.nci.nih.gov/"
            target="_blank">cis.nci.nih.gov</a>), the virus plays a
            major role in cancers of the anus, vulva (the external
            female genital organs, including the clitoris, vaginal
            lips, and the opening to the vagina), vagina and
            penis.</p>

            <p>In fact, according to Neurologist Dr. Artemio
            Ordinario, in Israel, there are only a few cases of <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/">cervical
            cancer</a> as compared to other countries. Israel, by
            virtue of being predominantly Jewish, requires all men
            to be circumcised. This is based on sacred scriptures
            that deem circumcision as a necessity in man's
            salvation.</p>

            <p>Both based on Jewish tradition, the Christian and
            Catholic beliefs, however, do not consider circumcision
            as a necessity for salvation, but a symbol of the
            covenant between God and His people. This covenant was
            made between God and Abraham, the father of all
            nations.</p>

            <p>According to the article Circumcision in the website
            Free Minds (www.freeminds.com), it was written in Gen
            17:14-13 that "Any uncircumcised male who is not
            circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut
            off from his people; he has broken my covenant. This is
            the covenant of circumcision."</p>

            <p>It is only Muslims, who by faith, are not obliged to
            circumcise their sons. But if they choose to have them
            circumcised, they may. There are some Muslims who
            subscribe to circumcision, even in the Philippines and
            other Muslim countries, as patterned from their belief
            that women should always wear headscarves. The article
            said, "This is similar to the headscarf which some
            women wear out of fear that it is a 'command' from God
            &hellip; as long as you know that it is not a command
            from God, then the woman is free to wear it or
            disregard it as she sees fit."</p>

            <p><b>Anticircumcision campaign</b></p>

            <p>In an effort to ban routine circumcision in the
            country, <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/philippinestar02-11-03/">
            Dr. Reynaldo Joson</a>, former chairperson of the
            Department of Surgery of <a
            href="http://www.pinoyway.com/dhosp10.htm"
            target="_blank">Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center</a>,
            launched an antiroutine circumcision campaign based on
            the belief that it is unnecessary for salvation and as
            a medical procedure.</p>

            <p>"I want to save millions and generations of Filipino
            children from unnecessary circumcision; its pain and
            its risk of complications including death," said Dr.
            Joson in an interview posted on his <a
            href="http://xtulepinoy.tripod.com/"
            target="_blank">website</a>
            (www.xtulepinoy.tripod.com).</p>

            <p>Dr. Joson acknowledges that there are only three
            reasons for circumcision-religious, medical, and
            non-medical-but that they are not enough to justify the
            procedure. He added that there are no clear medical
            benefits in circumcision except if it is done for the
            purpose of therapeutic circumcision.</p>

            <p>In therapeutic circumcision, the procedure carried
            out to cure or prevent phimosis, paraphimosis and
            balanitis in susceptible males. The procedure is the
            same but the rationality of the procedure-why it is
            being performed-makes the difference.</p>

            <p>Dr. Joson said that the only reason why routine
            circumcision is still being done in the country is
            because of the social stigma caused by being called
            "supot." The ways he sees it, circumcision is only done
            solely for "the promotion of the social and mental
            well-being of the male individual."</p>

            <p>"Since there are <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/manilabulletin05-28-02/">
            no medical benefits for circumcision</a> and neither is
            it necessary for salvation, saving males from the
            medically and religiously unnecessary procedure-this
            painful tradition-should be done. (The situation)
            should be changed to save the boys from being forced
            into circumcision just because of the cultural stigma
            of 'supot'," he explained.</p>

            <p>Dr. Joson said that proper hygiene is enough to
            prevent foreskin diseases from developing. Similarly,
            Dr. Blas said that cleaning the penis with soap and
            water every day would already suffice as a proper
            cleaning method.</p>

            <p>According to anti-circumcision advocates, meanwhile,
            many of the reasons for circumcision in this country
            are all myths. Some of these myths contain that without
            circumcision a boy will not grow tall; that his penis
            would not grow bigger; that during intercourse, a
            circumcised male "performs" better; among others. There
            is no scientific evidence that would prove any of
            this.</p>

            <p>In fact, Dr. Joson wrote a letter to Letty
            Jimenez-Magsanoc, editor-in-chief of the Philippine
            Daily Inquirer last year, saying, "The presence of the
            foreskin has been shown to have fuller range of sexual
            experience during sexual activities."</p>

            <p>On the issue of cervical cancer and other sexually
            transmitted diseases stemming from uncircumcised
            individuals, Dr. Joson maintained, "There is no solid
            evidence in literature that show preserving the
            foreskin is the direct cause of the diseases, and that
            circumcision will directly prevent their
            occurrence."</p>

            <p>Furthermore, Dr. Joson said that with circumcision,
            there are risks that can sometimes lead to death.
            According to Dr. Blas, risks such as bleeding,
            infection and painful erections can increase if
            individuals are circumcised when they are too young
            (some are circumcised in infancy) or if they were not
            physically strong at the time of the procedure.</p>

            <p><b>To cut or not to cut?</b></p>

            <p>Most young doctors, according to Dr. Blas, are no
            longer for routine circumcision. Like him, some doctors
            still perform routine circumcision upon the request of
            the parents or the child, or both, but refuse to join
            annual Operation Tule campaigns.</p>

            <p>Several medical institutions have stopped conducting
            Operation Tule such as the <a
            href="http://www.pinoyway.com/dhosp10.htm"
            target="_blank">Ospital ng Maynila</a>, the first
            hospital to do so; the Perinatal Center of the <a
            href="http://www.doh.gov.ph/quert/pcmc.html"
            target="_blank">Philippines Children's Medical
            Center</a>; <a href="http://www.pgh.gov.ph/"
            target="_blank">Philippine General Hospital</a>; and
            the Zamboanga Medical Center.</p>

            <p>However, the Catholic Church has yet to act on the
            issue. Dr. Joson submitted a letter to <a
            href="http://www.archdioceseofmanila.net/indexsin.html"
            target="_blank">Cardinal Sin</a> regarding the
            endorsement of therapeutic circumcision in place of
            routine circumcision but he has yet to receive word on
            the matter.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, Dr. Joson said the only person who
            should decide whether or not to undergo circumcision is
            the boy himself. "With research findings that routine
            circumcision is not warranted anymore, there is now an
            option not to have a circumcision done if it is not
            medically needed," he ended.</p>

            <p><b>Cutting the edge</b></p>

            <p>Traditionally, when a young Filipino boy reaches his
            adolescent years, he is forced to undergo circumcision.
            There are two versions of having a circumcision. One is
            through doctors and the other one, through a manunule.
            However, both have one purpose-to cut.</p>

            <p>Prior to the procedure, all young boys are asked
            "Kapon ka na ba?" Kapon means that the boy has tried
            retracting his penis before. If the boy says "No," then
            the doctor or manunule advises that he does so before
            going through the procedure. This makes the procedure
            easier since it would involve stretching the foreskin
            before cutting it. This would be extremely painful for
            a boy who has never retracted his penis.</p>

            <p>When the boy is ready, using sterilized surgical
            knives, a medical practitioner (usually a doctor)
            creates a slit on the upper side of the foreskin
            surrounding the head of the penis. This is followed by
            the removal of the "sleeve of the foreskin." After the
            procedure, medicines are given to the patient for the
            wound to heal.</p>

            <p>However, in rural areas, there are "specialists" who
            do the "traditional pukpok under the tree, near the
            river" to perform the same procedure. Before the
            pukpok, the manunule or pukpok asks the one to be
            circumcised to chew guava tops. The manunule then uses
            a sharpened labaja or barber's knife to cut the
            foreskin. The manunule then places the boy's chewed
            guava tops on the genital as a way of medication. The
            "new man," as they are usually called, then jumps into
            the river for cleansing. Jumping into the river would
            then constrict the blood vessels and stop the bleeding
            of the wound. Though it is unsanitary, the procedure is
            accepted and has been practiced for decades in rural
            areas.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, some doctors prefer performing
            circumcision in infancy, for an easier procedure where
            the subject does not resist and the skin is still soft.
            There is no truth, however, to the rumor that if boys
            are circumcised in infancy the foreskin grows back. In
            instances where the foreskin is believed to have grown
            back, the reason doctors point to is wrong cut during
