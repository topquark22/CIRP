        <h2><font face="verdana, arial, sans-serif">Circumcision
        tragedy in South Africa</font></h2>

        <p><font face="verdana, arial, sans-serif">A boy has died
        and 24 others have been hospitalised in South Africa after
        circumcisions performed as part of a rite of passage
        ceremony went wrong.</font></p>
        <hr size="1" color="black" align="right" width="60%" />

        <p align="right"><font
        face="verdana, arial, sans-serif"><strong>The circumcisions
        had gone wrong in every single case<br />
         Police spokesman Mabhelo Ngame</strong></font></p>
        <hr size="1" color="black" align="right" width="60%" />

        <p><font face="verdana, arial, sans-serif">According to
        police spokesman Inspector Mabhelo Ngame, the boys, aged
        between 14 and 18 years of age, were in a serious condition
        in hospital.</font></p>

        <p><font face="verdana, arial, sans-serif">There are fears
        that some may have to have their penises
        amputated.</font></p>

        <p><font face="verdana, arial, sans-serif">The circumcision
        operations were performed at an initiation school in the
        town of Bizana in the Eastern Cape province on Thursday
        evening.</font></p>

        <p><font face="verdana, arial, sans-serif">The 25 boys were
        subsequently rushed to the nearby St Peter's
        hospital.</font></p>

        <p><font face="verdana, arial, sans-serif">"The
        circumcisions had gone wrong in every single case," said
        Inspector Ngame.</font></p>

        <p><font face="verdana, arial, sans-serif"><strong>Xhosa
        tradition</strong></font></p>

        <p><font face="verdana, arial, sans-serif">The young men
        belong to the Xhosa ethnic group, for whom circumcision is
        part of the passage into manhood.</font></p>

        <p><font face="verdana, arial, sans-serif">The operations
        are usually performed in June and December when South
        African schools are on holiday.</font></p>

        <p><font face="verdana, arial, sans-serif">Doctors have
        tried to encourage initiation schools to adopt more
        hygienic techniques, but these are often rejected by
        village elders as contrary to traditional
        teachings.</font></p>

        <p><font face="verdana, arial, sans-serif">The South African
        Government is considering legislation that would make a
        botched circumcision punishable with a prison sentence of
        up to five years.</font></p>
