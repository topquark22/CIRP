            <h2>Man Forcibly Circumcised As Crowd Watches</h2>

            <p>A man was yesterday forcibly circumcised by
            traditional surgeons in Mumias-Butere District as
            police watched helplessly.</p>

            <p>Mr John Otieko, an employee of Mumias Sugar Company,
            was cornered by a mob as he walked along the
            Mumias-Bungoma highway in the Western Province.</p>

            <p>He was stripped naked, frog-marched to a nearby
            river and covered with clay in a ritual known as
            okhulonga among the local Luhya communities.</p>

            <p>He was then brought to Mayoni trading centre in
            Matungu constituency to be circumcised as an excited
            crowd watched.</p>

            <p>Efforts by four traffic police officers who were
            manning a roadblock on the highway a few metres away
            from the scene failed when the crowd started stoning
            them. The victim was then left bleeding at the
            scene.</p>

            <p>He was rushed to the Mumias Sugar Company's
            dispensary, where he was treated and discharged.</p>

            <p>Mr Otieko's wife Hawa Wesonga told the police to
            track down the culprits.</p>

            <p>She said her husband is from Siaya District and has
            two wives and five children.</p>

            <p>District Commissioner Ernest Munyi expressed shock
            at the incident and told police to crack down on
            traditional surgeons involved in forcible
            circumcision.</p>
