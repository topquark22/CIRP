            circumcise daughter</h2>

            <p>By <a href="mailto:lmungin@ajc.com">LATEEF
            MUNGIN</a><br />
             The Atlanta Journal-Constitution<br />
             Published on: 03/02/04</p>

            <p>A father accused of performing female genital
            mutilation on his then two-year-old daughter was
            indicted by a Gwinnett grand jury.</p>

            <p>Khalid Adem, 28, was indicted Friday and charged
            with aggravated battery and cruelty to children. Adem,
            arrested in March of 2003, is accused of using scissors
            to circumcise his daughter.</p>

            <p>The toddler's mother alerted police of the alleged
            incident, which police say took place in 2001.</p>

            <p>Adem's attorney, W. Mark Hill, contends that someone
            else could have performed the circumcision, including
            the child's mother or grandmother, who have roots in a
            South African tribe that has practiced female
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>"He did not do it," said Hill. "We have asked the
            maternal grandmother and the mother to take a lie
            detector test, but they will not do it."</p>

            <p>Since the arrest, the couple has divorced and Adem
            does not have visitation rights, Hill said. Adem was
            born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the U.S. more than
            10 years ago, Hill said.</p>

            <p>Gwinnett police Sgt. Jay Fetner said during a
            preliminary court hearing that the word of the child is
            the only evidence police have connecting Adem to the
            circumcision. The child told a doctor that Adem had
            performed the procedure in his Duluth apartment while
            Adem's friend held her legs, Fetner said.</p>

            <p>The traditional African practice of female
            circumcision has been denounced for decades by health
            and human rights activists. In some areas in Africa,
            the act can involve a coming-of-age ritual celebrated
            with feasting, drumming, dancing and gifts.</p>

            <p>Opponents claim the act, which typically involves
            the removal of the clitoris, is extremely painful and
            unsafe.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/"
            target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and
            Prevention</a> estimates that more than 160,000 girls
            and women in immigrant communities in the United States
            may have undergone circumcision.</p>
