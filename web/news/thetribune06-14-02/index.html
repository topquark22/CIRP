      <h2>Arizona rightly ended funds for circumcisions.</h2>

      <p>Arizona, whose most popular alternate license plate says,
      "It Shouldn't Hurt to Be a Child," has validated that
      statement by deciding to no longer pay for routine infant
      circumcisions for newborn boys under Medicaid.</p>

      <p>It means as many as 12,600 more Arizona newborns per year
      likely won't suffer genital mutilation at birth because
      there will be no Medicaid funding to subsidize the intrusive,
      medically unnecessary surgery.</p>

      <p>Arizona becomes the seventh state, along with California,
      Oregon, Washington, Nevada, North Dakota and Mississippi, to
      end such taxpayer-supported circumcisions. North Dakota
      stopped Medicaid coverage in 1991.</p>

      <p>When government departments were instructed to offer up
      ways to cut their budgets, the <a
      href="http://www.ahcccs.state.az.us/" target="_blank">Arizona
      Health Care Cost Containment System</a> staff determined they
      could save money by not cutting foreskins. While their prime
      motive was balancing the budget, their actions were a de
      facto endorsement of infant human rights and body integrity.
      They confirmed what has been known for decades about
      circumcision: The impairing procedure permanently removes
      what nature put there for a purpose and offers spurious
      health benefits.</p>

      <p>"There are all kinds of reports now that say it
      isn't medically necessary," said Sen. Ruth
      Solomon, D-Tucson, during the recent legislative session as
      lawmakers sought ways to balance the $6.1 billion budget for
      the year beginning July 1. With no medical society in the
      world recommending circumcision, it becomes an issue of
      medical ethics to stop the discredited procedure that
      survives in America largely out of cultural tradition and
      conformity with the tacit support of doctors who know better.
      Repeated studies by the American Academy of Pediatrics, since
      <a href="/library/statements/aap/#1971">1971</a>, and other
      research confirm that medical risks, pediatric trauma and
      permanent structure loss outweigh any slight benefits.</p>

      <p>Other states, also facing tough challenges to balance
      budgets, are eyeing eliminating medical reimbursements for
      circumcision. A growing number of private insurance companies
      have similarly dropped coverage. They have determined it is a
      form of elective cosmetic surgery &mdash; elective for
      parents, but clearly without consent of a helpless baby boy
      whose foreskin is amputated.</p>

      <p>Medicaid paid an average of $132 per circumcision in
      Arizona last year, or $1.6 million &mdash; two-thirds of it
      in federal dollars and one-third, or about $554,400, from
      state funds. A national study, completed last year, noted
      that where states pay more than $60 per circumcision, the
      rate of such surgeries is twice as high as when they are
      under $50 (38 percent to 20.2 percent), thus suggesting a
      financial incentive for doctors to perform what they
      otherwise wouldn't press parents to perform.</p>

      <p>With growing public awareness that the foreskin plays
      multiple roles for <a
      href="/library/disease/STD/fleiss3/">protection</a>, <a
      href="/library/general/falliers1/">sensitivity</a>, <a
      href="/library/general/warren2/">lubrication</a> and the <a
      href="/pages/anat/">mechanics of sex</a>, the rate of
      circumcision in America has dropped from almost 90 percent in
      the 1970s to under 60 percent today, and only about 35
      percent in America's western states.</p>

      <p>Public awareness has stemmed from a host of books
      debunking circumcision, countless Internet Web sites and
      clearer informed-consent forms for expectant parents. Add to
      that lawsuits from botched circumcisions, deaths attributed
      to complications from circumcisions, and the work of
      activists and such outspoken anti-circumcision voices as
      Howard Stern, Dr. Dean Edell and the late Dr. Benjamin Spock.
      Currently about 25.9 percent of all circumcisions of newborns
      performed nationally are in low-income families covered by
      Medicaid. At least $35 million in public funds could be saved
      and more than 310,000 baby boys per year could grow up whole
      and intact as more than 80 percent of males do worldwide. Dr.
      George Denniston, a Seattle physician who founded <a
      href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/"
      target="_blank">Doctors Opposed to Circumcision</a>, recalls
      when he once did circumcisions, "I clearly violated, all in
      one instant, the Golden Rule (I certainly would not have
      wanted that done to me); the major tenet of medical practice,
      "First, do no harm"; and all seven Principles of
      the American Medical Association's <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama/">Code of
      Ethics</a>."</p>

      <p>Forty-seven human rights and genital integrity
      organizations and centers last year sent petitions to
      Congress to end Medicaid reimbursements. They further
      question the double standard of the federal government, which
      banned female circumcision in 1996, but fails to provide
      equal protection under the law for males in the area of
      genital mutilation. Some 1.2 million American baby boys are
      circumcised annually &mdash; an estimated $270 million
      business. Little wonder, many doctors perpetuate the process
      despite its lack of support by professional groups. They
      capitalize on uninformed and misinformed parents who
      typically think circumcisions are correcting nature or
      somehow go with birth.</p>

      <p>In a Tribune article in December 1978, Dr. Robert Ganelin,
      then chairman of pediatrics at Maricopa County Hospital,
      assailed routine circumcisions, which had reached 88 percent
      of all males born at Desert Samaritan Hospital in Mesa.
      "I have a great concern for the dollar cost and the
      time involved &mdash; too much money is being spent for
      circumcisions that generally are not necessary," he
      said. "Also, our personnel at county, in taking the
      time to perform circumcisions, are being taken away from
      medical calls that many be more important." "The
      kids scream through the entire procedure because it's
      very painful," he added.</p>

      <p>Now 24 years later, Arizona, which often ranks abysmally
      low in measurements of the health, safety and welfare of its
      children, has taken a key step forward in respecting the
      rights of our newest citizens. Fewer newborns will face the
      assault of the <a href="/library/procedure/gomco/">Gomco
      clamp</a> &mdash; the rudest welcome to a baby's world.
      May parents, regardless of income or insurance, recognize the
      inherent right of all human beings to an intact body,
      especially in Arizona, where "it shouldn't hurt to be a
      child."</p>
