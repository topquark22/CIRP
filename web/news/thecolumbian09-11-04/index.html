            <h2>No bail drop in circumcision case</h2>

            <p>Saturday, September 11, 2004<br />
             <b>By KEN OLSEN, Columbian staff writer</b></p>

            <p>A Ridgefield man accused in the botched circumcision
            of his 8-year-old son will continue to be held on
            $50,000 bail because his family, including the alleged
            victim, can't be located, Clark County Superior Court
            Judge <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/courts/superior/judges.html"
             target="_blank">Diane Woolard</a> ruled Friday.</p>

            <p>An attorney for 33-year-old Edwin B. Baxter asked
            that the bail be reduced after prosecutors filed a
            second-degree child assault charge in connection with
            the Sept. 3 incident.</p>

            <p>Baxter was arrested on suspicion of first-degree
            child assault, resulting in the $50,000 bail.
            Prosecutors then decided there wasn't sufficient
            evidence to prove he intended to harm his son. The
            lesser charge reduces the maximum possible prison term
            from 10 years to approximately three years.</p>

            <p>That justifies a lower bail, defense attorney Tony
            Lowe said.</p>

            <p>Baxter wants to return to work as a truck driver to
            support his family.</p>

            <p>But senior deputy prosecutor <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/pa/criminal/childabuse.html"
             target="_blank">Kim Farr</a> told the judge that
            Baxter is likely to flee if freed before trial. That
            concern is heightened by the disappearance of Baxter's
            pregnant wife and nine children after the victim was
            released after treatment at <a
            href="http://www.swmedicalcenter.com/"
            target="_blank">Southwest Washington Medical
            Center</a>.</p>

            <p>"We can't find where they are and nobody knows where
            they are," Farr told the judge. "This appears to be a
            pattern of the Baxters," including the family's
            longstanding refusal to cooperate when state workers
            attempted to check on the children.</p>

            <p>The children are not enrolled in school.
            Investigators from the state <a
            href="https://fortress.wa.gov/dshs/caoffices/internetapps/ca/display.asp?officeName=Vancouver%20DCFS"
             target="_blank">Department of Children and Family
            Services</a> found the fence surrounding the family's
            rental home padlocked Tuesday.</p>

            <p>There also are unanswered questions about Baxter's
            criminal record. He may have as many as three
            misdemeanor convictions for fourth-degree assault in
            connection with domestic violence incidents dating back
            to the 1980s, Farr said. Bail reduction "is an
            opportunity for him to pick up and flee."</p>

            <p>Baxter, who is tall, bearded, and wears his dark
            hair in a crew cut, offered no information on the
            whereabouts of his family. However, a woman who said
            she was Baxter's grandmother assured the judge he
            wouldn't flee.</p>

            <p>"He wants to get out and support his children," she
            told the judge Friday. "I'm positive he won't flee. I'd
            stake my life on it."</p>

            <p>Woolard was unmoved. "It's not your life I'm worried
            about," the judge said. "It's the lives of the children
            I'm worried about."</p>

            <p>The woman, who was accompanied by an entourage of
            six other people, refused to comment after the court
            hearing.</p>

            <p>Baxter allegedly told <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/sheriff/index.html"
            target="_blank">Clark County Sheriff</a>'s deputies he
            tried to circumcise his son with a knife in the
            bathroom of the family's home after reading about the
            procedure in the Bible. He then called 911 to report
            his son was bleeding.</p>

            <p>Baxter returns to court Sept. 17 for
            arraignment.</p>
