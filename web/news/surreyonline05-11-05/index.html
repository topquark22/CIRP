            <h2>Father cleared of assault</h2>
            May 11 2005 

            <p>A FATHER who was alleged to have had his
            five-year-old son secretly circumcised has been found
            not guilty of assault.</p>

            <p>At Lewes <a target="_blank"
            href="http://www.mywiseowl.com/articles/Crown_Court">Crown
            Court</a> on Thursday last week, the 27-year-old
            Crawley man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was
            cleared of a charge of assault occasioning actual
            bodily harm.</p>

            <p>Lewes Crown Court heard how the Muslim defendant was
            alleged to have taken his son for the operation without
            the mother's consent.</p>

            <p>The child was the result of a brief relationship and
            the couple are no longer together.</p>

            <p>During the trial at Lewes Crown Court, the defendant
            said that he wanted his son to have the operation for
            religious reasons and did not think he was committing a
            crime.</p>

            <p>"I thought being his father I had some rights," he
            said. "If I had known I was breaking the law I would
            not have done it."</p>

            <p>After deliberating for almost five hours, jurors
            found him not guilty by a majority verdict.</p>

            <p>Judge Richard Brown said the case was unusual and
            that the result should not prompt other parents to
            carry out similar actions. "The decision on this case
            should not be taken by anyone else to act in the same
            way," he said.</p>
