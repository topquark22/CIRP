      <h2>$22.8 MILLION IN BOTCHED CIRCUMCISION</h2>
      <b>By Charles Seabrook</b><br />
       Staff writer 

      <p><a href="http://www.northside.com/"
      target="_blank">Northside Hospital</a> will pay $22.8 million
      to a boy severely injured in a circumcision accident at the
      hospital nearly six years ago, attorneys for the child said
      Monday.</p>

      <p>However, Northside spokeswoman Karen Koch denied that a
      final settlement had been reached and declined to comment
      further.</p>

      <p>The child, who is not 5 years old, had his penis severely
      burned in a mishap in August 1985. His attorneys said he will
      never be able to function sexually as a normal male and will
      require extensive reconstructive surgery and psychological
      counseling as well as lifelong urological care and treatment
      by infectious disease specialists.</p>

      <p>A second infant who underwent a circumcision at <a
      href="http://www.northside.com/"
      target="_blank">Northside</a> on the same day also was
      severely injured. That child, known as "Baby Doe" underwent a
      sex-change operation shortly after the accident, and
      "consequently is now a female person, who has been rendered
      sterile and completely incapable of reproduction," said a
      lawsuit filed in the child's behalf. That lawsuit was settled
      for an undisclosed amount, Northside officials said.</p>

      <p>Thomas G. Sampson, attorney for the first child, named
      Antonio, said Northside has agreed to pay the child $22.8
      million in several installments over the next several
      years.</p>

      <p>Mr. Sampson said he did not know why Northside has denied
      that the case has been settled.</p>

      <p>"It's settled, I can guarantee you that," said Mr.
      Sampson, who added that the settlement was approved Friday in
      <a
      href="https://dklbweb.dekalbga.org/courts/probate/index.htm"
      target="_blank">DeKalb County Probate Court</a>.</p>

      <p>The settlement is one of the largest even in a medical
      malpractice lawsuit in Georgia, he said. The parents of the
      child already had settled with the doctor who performed the
      circumcision, and Mr. Sampson said the total amount of money
      in the case is in excess of $23.8 million.</p>

      <p>The circumcision occurred at the hospital on the day the
      boy was born. Mr. Sampson and fellow attorneys alleged
      violations of hospital protocol and the use of inappropriate
      equipment for the circumcision.</p>

      <p>The hospital's usual equipment for circumcision was out of
      service the day the infant was born, and doctors instead used
      an electrosurgical unit "that was contraindicated for use" in
      infant circumcisions, the lawsuit alleged.</p>

      <p>Antonio already has undergone several operations, and a
      series of reconstructive operations, now under way, are
      expected to continue for at least nine years. until he is 15
      years old, his attorneys said.</p>

      <p>The circumcision injuries attracted nationwide attention,
      and prompted new studies to determine the benefits and
      disadvantages of circumcision. The studies indicate that the
      advantages outweigh the risks. Circumcised males have less
      incidence of urinary tract infections and penile cancer, the
      studies found.</p>
