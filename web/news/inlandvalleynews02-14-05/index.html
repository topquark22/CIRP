            <h3><i>San Dimas Canyon family is finally
            reunited</i></h3>

            <p>By CHRISTINA CHANES NYSTROM<br />
            CORRESPONDENT</p>

            <p>MONTEREY PARK - A San Dimas Canyon woman, who was
            dramatically rescued during last month's storms, was
            reunited with her two children Monday after a judge
            determined that there was not enough evidence to keep
            the children in protective custody.</p>

            <p>Erica and Jeffrey Henderson, who were flooded out of
            their San Dimas Canyon cabin on Jan. 10, had their
            children taken away by the <a
            href="http://dcfs.co.la.ca.us/" target="_blank">Los
            Angeles County Department of Children and Family
            Services</a> in the wake of a highly publicized rescue
            in the rain-swollen San Dimas Creek.</p>

            <p>However, <a
            href="http://www.lasuperiorcourt.org/Locations/childrenscourtjuv.htm"
             target="_blank">Los Angeles County children's
            court</a> <a
            href="http://www.lasuperiorcourt.org/judicialOfficers/result.asp?Referer=Index&amp;source=locations&amp;location=CCJ"
             target="_blank">Judge Phillip Soto</a> said
            accusations of neglect and putting the children at risk
            were based on poor evidence.</p>

            <p>"This is not a criminal court," Soto said. "This
            court is about issues related to substantial risks to a
            child and make no mistake, our goal is to reunite
            families."</p>

            <p>Soto said family services relied on reports,
            including allegations that Jeffrey Henderson had
            committed assault against neighbors, predating the Jan.
            10 rescue, that were lacking in evidence.</p>

            <p>"You have here issues detailed in reports but no
            arrests. The reports are not backed up by any
            evidence," Soto said. "I am fully aware of the hearsay
            that can go into these reports and although there are
            reports, the social workers report attached to the
            police report was incomplete."</p>

            <p>During the rescue, fire officials complained about
            Jeffrey Henderson's behavior and asked the <a
            href="http://da.co.la.ca.us/" target="_blank">District
            Attorney's Office</a> to file criminal charges against
            him. The district attorney, however, declined that
            request.</p>

            <p>The two children, 9-month old son William and
            19-month-old daughter Abigail, have been kept together
            with regular visitation from their parents.</p>

            <p>"I just want my babies back by my side and in our
            home," Erica Henderson said.</p>

            <p>The Hendersons, however, will be under close
            scrutiny from the county. The couple had Erica's
            8-year-old son, from a previous relationship, taken out
            of their care after Jeffrey was accused of striking the
            boy with a belt in 1998. The couple had another child
            die of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in 2002.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">County attorneys have also
            accused Jeffrey Henderson of performing a circumcision
            on William. Henderson says he is Hebrew and performed
            the circumcision out of religious duty.</span></p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Soto said there is no law
            prohibiting that practice.</span></p>

            <p><span class="yellow">"I do not want in anyway to
            imply that it is OK to do that or that people should go
            out and circumcise their children themselves," Soto
            said, "but it is only illegal if one mutilates a female
            -- there is nothing in the penal code about a male
            child."</span></p>

            <p>The Hendersons agreed to several conditions
            including: random drugs tests and unannounced social
            worker visits between the hours of 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.
            Soto also ordered the Hendersons to undergo counseling
            that included addressing anger issues.</p>

            <p>Jeffery Henderson's attorney Nathan Hoffman said the
            case was a weak one because there was nothing in the
            documentation that proved the accusations.</p>

            <p>The Hendersons, with their ordeal firmly behind
            them, were smiling from ear to ear after the ruling.
            "My wife and I are extremely happy," Jeffrey Henderson
            said. "I just feel bad for all those parents here today
            that did not get their kids back. The government has no
            business raising our children, just take one look at
            the public school system -- it's an excellent example
            that clearly shows they have repeatedly failed to teach
            our children anything."</p>
