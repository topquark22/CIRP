      A meeting was held at East London Mosque 

      <p><b>By BBC London's John McManus</b></p>

      <p>Muslim boys in London are risking infection and mutilation
      by inexperienced and bogus circumcision practitioners.</p>

      <p>Circumcision is widely practiced among Muslim communities,
      though the age at which boys are circumcised varies.</p>

      <p>The practice is only available through the NHS if there
      are compelling medical reasons, though local GP's may carry
      out the operation themselves.</p>

      <p>Problems arise when the procedure is carried out in an
      unsterile environment, such as the boy's home. This can leave
      the boys open to infection.</p>

      <p>A bigger problem are the "community practitioners", people
      who have no medical training, who carry out the circumcisions
      themselves.</p>

      <p><b>Crisis meeting</b></p>

      <p></p>

      <p>At a meeting held last week at the <a
      href="http://www.eastlondon-mosque.org.uk/">East London
      Mosque</a>, concerned parents, community leaders and doctors
      gathered to try and find a solution to the problem.</p>

      <p>The <a
      href="http://www.specialistinfo.com/ROHO.html">Royal London
      Hospital</a>, which serves much of London's East End, treated
      32 boys who were suffering from circumcision complications
      this summer.</p>

      <p>Matthew Ryan from Tower Hamlets Community Health Council,
      said the Hospital experienced a flood of sick boys every
      summer, as parents had their children circumcised over the
      long summer holidays, to allow them time to heal.</p>

      <p>And one Muslim parent told BBC London that his sons, aged
      5 and 10, were left in agony after being circumcised by a
      "community practitioner".</p>

      <p>Six people had to hold the boys down while they were
      circumcised without an anasthestic, and his GP was horrified
      when he later examined the children.</p>

      <p>The five-year-old eventually had to be kept isolated in
      hospital for 10 days while he recovered.</p>

      <p><b>Within the law</b></p>

      <p>Male circumcision, unlike the female variety, isn't
      illegal in Britain.</p>

      <p>It's classed as "consensual assault", similar to
      tattooing, and anyone can legally carry it out.</p>

      <p>If a GP is involved they must have had training.</p>

      <p>Unlike other forms of medicine, no list of registered
      practitioners exists, which is why parents often turn to
      unqualified people recommended to them through the Muslim
      community.</p>

      <p>Circumcision is practiced by nearly all of Britain's
      Muslims, says The Royal London's Muslim chaplain, Shafiqur
      Rahman.</p>

      <p>"Circumcision has been the practice of the Holy Prophets,
      from Abraham to Mohammed.</p>

      <p>"So it's an act of virtue to follow the Prophets, as well
      as a health choice."</p>

      <p><b>NHS call</b></p>

      <p>Mr Rahman believes the only way to protect Muslim boys
      from serious injury is to provide Circumcision through the
      NHS, monitoring procedures and making Doctors more
      accountable.</p>

      <p>The scale of the problem in London may lead to the NHS
      agreeing to provide the service. <a
      href="http://www.nursingnetuk.com/employerdetails.php/employerid=91">
      Tower Hamlets Primary Care Trust</a> is considering plans to
      offer the service for free, and are due to comment
      tomorrow.</p>

      <p>But they may decide to fund circumcisions on younger
      children only.</p>

      <p>Other areas of Britain, such as Leeds, already carry out
      the procedure for religious, rather than medical reasons.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, the Trust is issuing an information pack
      to parents, to alert them to the dangers posed by unqualified
      practitioners.</p>
