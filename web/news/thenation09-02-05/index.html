            <p>Nation Correspondents<br />
             Nairobi</p>

            <p>Eight boys have died and more than 15 admitted to
            hospital in Samburu District after undergoing
            traditional circumcision, according to the area's
            medical boss.</p>

            <p>Dr Philemon Too said the youths, between 15 and 20
            years, had been among a group of more than 10,000 who
            had undergone a mass ritual in most parts of the
            district in August.</p>

            <p>"Two died while undergoing treatment at the <a
            href="http://www.comesa.org/directory/cities.asp?cityName=Maralal&amp;categoryId=004&amp;subCategoryId=000101"
             target="_blank">Maralal District Hospital</a>, while
            the rest died at home, said Dr Too.</p>

            <p>Those who died were from Suguta, Baragoi, Nyiro and
            Loosuk locations. They had been cut by traditional
            circumcisers, he said yesterday.</p>

            <p>The medical officer said the boys bled to death and
            that efforts to educate the district's residents on the
            risks of engaging traditional circumcisers had been
            unsuccessful.</p>

            <p>Dr Too said the hospital had started mobile clinics
            to help the victims, and asked the police to arrest all
            unqualified practitioners in the area.</p>

            <p>Last month, two NGOs in the district - <a
            href="http://www.christianchildrensfund.org/"
            target="_blank">Christian Children's Fund</a> and
            Saidia [Samburu Aid in Africa] - donated 20,000
            assorted circumcision equipment to the residents.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, women pastoralists in Isiolo and Garissa
            districts have threatened to sue those who practise
            female genital mutilation.</p>

            <p>The practice, the women said, was harmful but the
            people in the two districts had refused to stop it.</p>

            <p>During a five-day workshop in Isiolo, the women, led
            by Ms Zeinab Yussuf Dogo, said they would seek the
            assistance of human rights organisations.</p>

            <p>UNICEF representative Bonne Wasike noted that the
            practice did not only affect girl child education but
            led to long-term complication among the women.</p>

            <p>He said such harmful cultural practices should be
            discarded.</p>
