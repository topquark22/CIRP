            <h4>Circumcision - beloved by the Victorians, crucial
            to two of the world's great religions, arguably a
            health boon - can be a cause of great anguish. Richard
            Johnson meets men finding ways to reverse a cut they
            wish they'd never had.</h4>

            <p>Saturday October 29, 2005<br />
            The Guardian</p>

            <p>Skin constantly renews itself. Foreskin is no
            different: stretch it, and it will grow. Which is why
            eight circumcised men are meeting in Watford town hall.
            They want new foreskins. "When people come to my
            house," says Laurie, "I don't go 'Hello there, I'm
            Laurie, I'm growing my foreskin', but I've often got
            research papers out on the table, so word gets out. I
            do find people are really very interested in what I'm
            doing."</p>

            <p>Laurie is sharing his experience of restoration, as
            the process of foreskin renewal is called, with fellow
            members of <a href="http://www.norm-uk.org/"
            target="_blank">NORM-UK</a>. In the US, where <a
            href="http://www.norm.org" target="_blank">NORM</a> was
            born (and where circumcision rates are somewhere around
            three-quarters of the male population, far higher than
            in Britain), it stands for National Organisation of
            Restoring Men. NORM-UK is about more than that, but
            Laurie is on a roll. And the others don't want to
            interrupt him - after all, in two and a half years,
            Laurie has achieved glans coverage when flaccid. In the
            world of restoration, that is major.</p>

            <p>NORM-UK meetings are small and intimate. Not usually
            as small and intimate as this one, but there's been a
            pile-up on the M1. There are a few handshakes, but
            otherwise little in the way of physical display -
            "People are always worried we're going to drop our
            trousers," says general manager David Smith. Laurie
            wouldn't be averse to the idea, to show off his
            stretching. Women stretch skin for reconstruction after
            a mastectomy. So why shouldn't men stretch a foreskin?
            Some men can't restore - they are too tightly
            circumcised and have no tissue left to grow, but others
            can and are availing themselves of products such as the
            TLC Tugger, Tug Ahoy and the Your-Skin cone. Some have
            found their own DIY solutions, using funnels and
            gaskets to stretch the foreskin, and sash-window
            weights to provide traction.</p>

            <p>The whole idea of <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/restore.html">restoration</a>
            sounds funny, like the time that Laurie was having a go
            with sticky tape, the most primitive of the restoration
            methods. He pulled what skin he had left over his
            glans, and taped it down. "I only had the tape on for
            half an hour", says Laurie, "but it was hell. I was
            walking down the high street and suddenly had to dive
            into the nearest toilet to check my penis hadn't gone
            black, green or blue. Or dropped off altogether."</p>

            <p>It sounds funny, but it isn't. Not if it's happening
            to you. Smith remembers sitting through the scene in
            the film East Is East in which the father tries to
            catch the son and take him to be circumcised. "I
            remember the cinema was in hysterics," says Smith, "and
            they were laughing when he was wheeled into the
            operating theatre, but all I could hear was the boy's
            screams. My wife turned to me and said, 'I've got to go
            - I can't watch this.'"</p>

            <p>When the foreskin is removed, it leaves the glans
            exposed and that can be difficult - removing a
            protective layer and sometimes creating soreness. "I
            always had a problem with my penis giving me
            stimulation I didn't want," says Kevin, recalling how,
            as a boy, "I had to keep adjusting it through my
            pocket. I was near the climbing frame in the playground
            when, all of a sudden, everyone started chanting 'Kevin
            is dirty - he's always playing with himself'. I didn't
            like the feeling of being odd, of being deformed.
            Suicide would have been a good option."</p>

            <p>Kevin is now 56 with a fully restored foreskin. But
            he's left with the question, why was he circumcised in
            the first place? His mother read the Bible and went to
            Sunday school. "But I was conceived out of wedlock when
            she was 17. And my father was a divorcee. They wanted
            to get married in church, so I think I was circumcised
            as some kind of apology to Jesus. My father wasn't
            circumcised himself, so I really don't understand." And
            that is a feeling he shares with many members of
            NORM-UK.</p>

            <p>Meetings are on a first-name-only basis because
            members don't like to be identified. "Many men who come
            to meetings won't even speak to their families about
            the pain they're suffering - we are dealing with
            victims of abuse here," says Smith.</p>

            <p>NORM-UK currently has just short of 300 members.
            Less than one inquiry in 10 results in membership, but
            it isn't strictly about the numbers. "Men often want
            the information to restore," says Smith, "but they want
            to keep it to themselves. They are frightened about
            being found out. When they ring me up, they say,
            'Please ensure that the information is in plain
            envelopes and don't put me on a mailing list.'"</p>

            <p>John D was like that. He felt abused because his
            circumcision was unnecessary - a course of antibiotics
            had already cleared up his urinary infection. "But my
            father agreed with the doctor, and told me I was going
            to have a minor operation," he says. "I remember the
            nurses giggling as I was taken off to theatre. They
            wore these big sickly grins, and said, 'We're taking
            you to be done up now. Hee hee hee.' I was eight, but
            suffice it to say that they knew what was happening to
            me and I did not ... I remember waking up," says John
            D, "after the general anaesthetic had worn off, and
            looking down. My beloved penis had been replaced with
            wrinkled skin, a collar of thorns - the black stitches
            - and an ugly great dome on top. I experienced shock at
            first, later deep anger and resentment. The stitches
            disappeared, but the mutilation didn't. My father said,
            'I didn't think it would look like that.' It was
            misinformed consent."</p>

            <p>There are lots of horror stories about circumcision.
            Like the time in Baltimore in 1964 that it went so
            badly wrong that the doctors decided to change the
            child's sex. Or the time in London in 1991 when a
            16-year-old was circumcised so badly that he bled all
            night and died. But these cases are extraordinary, and
            far from typical. Even for adults, circumcision is
            reckoned a safe and easy operation. Opponents of the
            procedure, however, don't see it like that. John E is
            blind. But it's not his blindness that keeps him from
            meetings. "It's the fact I feel I've been more
            devastated than everyone else," he says. "They've got
            their lives in order. And they've got sexual partners.
            I haven't. My life has been ruined by circumcision,
            although I hate that word. I prefer 'foreskin
            amputation'. It's not an operation - there's no medical
            benefit. It's a rite. A faith crime."</p>

            <p>In the Bible, circumcision was God's covenant with
            Abraham and the Jewish people. Of all of the
            commandments in Judaism, the brit milah (literally,
            covenant of circumcision) is probably the most
            universally observed. And although circumcision isn't
            actually mentioned in the Qur'an, it is mentioned in
            other Islamic texts. Most Muslims believe it's
            fundamental because Allah ordered Muhammad to follow
            the way of Abraham.</p>

            <p>Asked if NORM-UK has Jewish and Muslim members,
            Smith replies, "Yes we do, but it is difficult to
            estimate the number because if someone joins us we do
            not ask their religion, nor are we really
            interested."</p>

            <p>Religious circumcisions are frequently performed
            without anaesthetic, and are painful, even when
            performed on newborn babies. Adults can testify to the
            pain for themselves and can give their informed consent
            - but children can't. If, as opponents claim,
            circumcision is traumatic, and can result in lifelong
            damage - including psychological problems and a reduced
            sex drive - why are religious circumcisions still
            allowed?</p>

            <p>NORM-UK says, actually, they aren't allowed: the <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-convention/"
             target="_blank">UN Convention on the Rights of the
            Child</a> declares that violence to children cannot be
            justified on grounds of "religion, culture or
            tradition". Children are not the possessions of their
            parents to do with as they please - or submit to
            surgery unless absolutely necessary. We make an
            exception for circumcision because it's mentioned in
            Genesis.</p>

            <p>Dr Zuhair Zarifa, from Docklands in east London, is
            one of the few surgeons prepared to advertise the fact
            that he will circumcise males for religious or ethnic
            reasons. "Why not?" he says. "The operations are
            permitted by the <a href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/"
            target="_blank">General Medical Council</a>. And they
            will happen whether I do them or not. It's much better
            for the operations to happen in my surgery under
            clinical conditions with anaesthetic, where I can
            provide all the necessary aftercare."</p>

            <p>Even nonpractising Jews tend to circumcise their
            sons. It was, after all, the first command given to
            Abraham and the defining physical mark of the Jewish
            people. Circumcision involves "Hatafat Dam Brit" - a
            drop of blood that seals a covenant. Which does, for
            some, suggest that removing the foreskin goes beyond
            what is required by God. But, according to Rabbi Dr
            Jeremy Rosen, that is to miss the point.</p>

            <p>"People are always trying to find rational reasons
            for Jewish laws," says Rosen. "They ask if our dietary
            laws improve hygiene. They ask if observing the Sabbath
            helps mental relaxation. And they ask if circumcision
            prevents STDs. But even if these rational reasons stood
            up to objective scrutiny, they wouldn't be a reason for
            keeping - or abandoning - our laws. One keeps to these
            rules out of religious commitment. I have no medical
            expertise," adds Rosen, who runs the London branch of
            the liberal <a href="http://www.yakar.org.uk/"
            target="_blank">Yakar Educational Foundation</a>, "but
            I am convinced that circumcision is harmless, and not
            traumatic. But even if it is, we Jews have done pretty
            well on it over the years - and so indeed have
            Muslims."</p>

            <p>Circumcision on females was made illegal in the UK
            in 1985. The same protection is not extended to males
            precisely because it would involve taking on two of the
            world's great religions. Most forms of female
            circumcision are, certainly, more damaging than male
            circumcision, but the distinction in law between male
            and female circumcision just can't be justified
            objectively. It is a double standard.</p>

            <p>Circumcision was not practised in Britain until the
            18th century and it really only gained popularity in
            the 19th century, after claims that it stopped the vile
            habit of masturbation. By stopping masturbation,
            Victorians thought circumcision would cure everything
            from epilepsy and hip trouble to asthma and alcoholism.
            In the first world war it was hailed as a defence
            against venereal disease, and by the second world war
            it had become an emblem of status; most of the middle
            and upper classes were eagerly circumcising their sons.
            Only in the late 1940s, with the introduction of the <a
            href="http://www.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">National
            Health Service</a>, did numbers begin to fall - it is
            now estimated that around 20% of the current male
            population in the UK are circumcised.</p>

            <p>But whenever a new disease becomes a matter of
            social concern, circumcision is wheeled out as the
            cure. A recent paper in the British Medical Journal
            found a link between an intact foreskin and HIV
            infection - but a paper in the British Journal Of
            Urology found exactly the opposite. There is clear
            medical evidence that circumcision reduces the
            incidence of cancer of the penis, and of the cervix for
            the women whose partners are circumcised, but even this
            is disputed by NORM-UK. It argues that the research is
            out of date and that a lack of cleanliness is more
            important to the transmission of disease than the lack
            of a foreskin.</p>

            <p>The organisation doesn't want to see circumcision
            banned altogether. It accepts there are a few medical
            conditions where it is necessary. The others can be
            treated by simple, nonsurgical means."We need to
            educate the medical profession," says Smith, "because
            they seem unaware of the alternatives to circumcision.
            They are certainly unaware of the problems that it is
            causing."</p>

            <p>John D is typical of NORM-UK members in that
            circumcision when he was a young boy changed his entire
            persona. "I became less sociable, and I started talking
            to myself. I was fearful of changing rooms. I had no
            close relationship with the opposite sex until I was
            41, and I still haven't been able to reach orgasm
            through sexual intercourse. Over the years, I've had
            real problems with depression, and I'm sure I could
            trace it back to that day."</p>

            <p>These are not the issues foremost in doctors' minds.
            Take a look at the General Practice notebook, an online
            medical encyclopaedia used by GPs, and its listing for
            phimosis - a condition where the foreskin won't
            retract. Most infants are born with a foreskin that
            can't be retracted and the foreskin is often tight
            until after puberty. Phimosis disappears in almost all
            cases given time. A fully retractable foreskin occurs
            on its own in 99% of 18-year-olds. But the notebook
            recommends circumcision.</p>

            <p>The notebook makes no mention whatever of the
            noninvasive solutions to the problem - such as
            stretching, steroid cream or a simpler operation.
            Similarly, there are nonsurgical solutions to
            balanitis, a condition where the foreskin retracts too
            tightly, causing the glans to swell. "It sounds silly,"
            says John D, "but balanitis can be cured by putting the
            penis in a bowl of sugar. The swelling goes down, and
            the foreskin returns to its resting position."</p>

            <p>Zarifa isn't sure about the bowl of sugar - but he
            insists that doctors always explore noninvasive options
            first. "The truth of the matter is that stretching can
            be quite painful," he says. "And it's quite an
            undertaking for a small child. For some boys, the pain
            of the stretching is as bad as the pain of the
            circumcision. And I would say that 40-50% of boys who
            use steroid cream end up having a circumcision in the
            end. But it's always the last option."</p>

            <p>The BMA supports conservative solutions where
            possible. But unnecessary circumcisions are still
            happening. And, as the Commons health committee noted,
            they are happening "because doctors don't understand
            the natural history of the foreskin". Circumcision for
            babies and for older people is dismissed as "the snip",
            but it can still result in serious bleeding, or an
            adverse reaction to the anaesthetic. "And you cannot
            cut off normal, healthy, sexually-functioning tissue
            without cutting off normal, healthy, sexual
            functioning," says Marilyn Milos, a nurse and director
            of the <a href="http://www.nocirc.org"
            target="_blank">National Organisation of Circumcision
            Information Resource Centres</a> in the US. "It's a
            sexual issue, and it's a human rights issue." The
            foreskin isn't a useless flap that evolution should
            have got rid of long, long ago - it's skin that is rich
            with blood vessels, highly innervated, and uniquely
            endowed with stretch receptors. These contribute
            greatly to the sexual response of the intact male. The
            stretching of the foreskin over the glans activates
            nerve endings, enhances sexual excitability, and
            contributes to the ejaculatory reflex. There's no
            escaping it - the foreskin is sexual tissue.</p>

            <p>Laurie can laugh now, but he missed his foreskin (it
            was removed when he was two). He was getting on for 60,
            and rapidly losing the feeling in his penis. "To be
            honest," he says, "sex was like pushing a rolling pin
            in. And I'm not referring to size when I say 'rolling
            pin' - you can get little rolling pins. I just could
            not feel a thing." His glans had been badly
            desensitised after years of rattling around - so much
            so that he could have an orgasm and not even feel it.
            That is when he approached NORM-UK.</p>

            <p>During heterosexual intercourse with a circumcised
            man, the penis removes natural lubrication as it moves
            in and out of the vagina. "So my poor wife was buying
            artificial lubricant by the gallon," says Laurie.
            During heterosexual intercourse with an uncircumcised
            man, the glans moves but the foreskin stays put. And so
            does the lubrication. The woman doesn't feel friction
            at all - what she does feel is a variation in
            pressure.</p>

            <p>Laurie is delighted. "And so is my wife," he says.
            "The skin grew in jumps. I did a lot of work for a long
            time and nothing happened, like with the sticky tape,
            but suddenly I woke up one morning and thought 'Where's
            that come from?' " The new foreskin didn't have the
            nerve endings it once did, but the glans recovered all
            its sensitivity. "For 40 years my wife and I had to use
            lubrication. Not any more. We're delighted."</p>

            <p>David Smith is NORM-UK's one paid employee. He
            started admitting he worked for the charity only after
            his parents died - he couldn't bear the questions. (The
            Charity Commission put the organisation on probation
            for 12 months to ensure that it was not a cover for
            pornography.) Smith's wages come out of a grant from
            Lloyds TSB. But, apart from him, the trustees are all
            volunteers. Running NORM-UK is a big job: liaising with
            Great Ormond Street to correct the circumcision "fact
            file" on the hospital website, setting up meetings with
            the Family Planning Clinic, and doing mail-outs to
            midwives, recommending the alternatives to
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>Meet the members of NORM-UK and you'll understand
            that it's more important to look at the <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/">complications
            of circumcision</a>, and its physical and psychological
            side effects. In time, campaigners hope that routine
            circumcision will come to be seen as yet another
            deluded fad, along with bleeding, electro-convulsive
            therapy and the frontal lobotomy.</p>
