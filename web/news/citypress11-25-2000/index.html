      <h2>Bill to regulate circumcision expected</h2>
      <b>Mncedi Mkokeli</b>

      <p>The Eastern Cape health department is waiting anxiously
      for the implementation of a delayed Bill that is expected to
      regulate circumcision in order to prevent deaths and
      injuries, said Health MEC Bevan Goqwana this week.</p>

      <p>Goqwana said the proposed bill was supposed to have been
      passed by parliament in October. He said the matter had been
      delayed by the office of the president. The bill is aimed at
      banning the performance of traditional circumcisions without
      a doctor present to examine initiates.</p>

      <p>After the implementation of the bill, traditional Xhosas
      who resorted to the old bush practice without obtaining a
      doctor's approval would face heavy fines, he said.</p>

      <p>The fine would be up to R5,000 or imprisonment of up to
      five years, or both. The proposed law would give authority to
      provincial and local governments to prosecute traditional
      surgeons for any negligence in circumcisions that could
      result in the death of initiates.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Goqwana said the department was educating
      people about the importance of cleanliness during the
      initiation rite. He also said communities had to engage the
      services of experienced men to be traditional surgeons and
      nurses.</p>

      <p>The bill has received a lukewarm welcome from Eastern Cape
      traditional leaders.</p>

      <p>Eastern Cape house of traditional leaders deputy
      chairperson, Chief Dumisani Gwadiso, told ECN the
      circumcision rite was safe when monitored by traditional
      leaders.</p>

      <p>"The rite needs no expertise other than proper
      administration of its affairs." - ECN</p>
