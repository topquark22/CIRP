      <h2>Parents charged</h2>

      <p>An unwed couple whose garbage-strewn apartment allegedly
      caused the death of their 15-day-old son have been charged
      with felony child endangerment and involuntary manslaughter,
      a Los Angeles prosecutor says. Lori Ann Needham, 20, and
      Christopher Tomas Chacon, 22, were charged Wednesday after
      the death of Steven Christopher Chacon, who died in his crib
      three days after being circumcised, Deputy District Attorney
      Kenneth Loveman said. <span class="yellow">He said the baby
      died from "exposure to filth," which infected the unhealed
      circumcision.</span> Chacon, an auto mechanic, and Needham
      were originally booked for investigation of felony child
      endangerment and released on bail. But the additional
      involuntary manslaughter charge was filed Wednesday after
      further investigation, Loveman said."</p>
