            <h1>THE SNIPPER</h1>

            <h2><i>Christopher Middleton talks to the &lsquo;mohel'
            of Golders Green</i></h2>

            <p class="init">Two or three times a week, Morris
            Sifman hurries out his front door, on urgent
            business.</p>

            <p class="text">Grey-haired, short, busy-footed, he
            carries in his hand a heavy maroon travelling case,
            almost half his size and weight. Inside are the tools
            of his calling: bandages, scissors, a selection of
            small silver shields, a long metal probe - and a
            double-bladed knife, made of Sheffield steel.</p>

            <p class="text">For a living, Sifman is a GP, attending
            to the coughs and sneezes of Golders Green. But he also
            has another, unpaid, altogether less well know role -
            as <i>mohel</i>, or circumciser, to north London's
            Jewish community.</p>

            <p class="text">Like as not, his destination will be a
            suburban home, somewhere in NW10 or 11. Here a crowd of
            friends and relatives will have gathered to celebrate
            the birth of a new baby boy, to hear him being named,
            and to watch him having his foreskin removed.</p>

            <p class="text">Even when demonstrating with just a
            rubber glove and his finger, Dr Sifman's explanation
            causes the hearer to wince. The first step involves a
            nicely judged amount of foreskin being fed into a
            little clamp-cum-shield, shaped like an old fashioned
            carving-knife sharpener, after which a thin membrane is
            pulled back with the probe to just below the rim of the
            penis. <span>Then he has to stimulate the flow of blood
            by sucking the wound, either directly with the mouth,
            or indirectly via a glass tube.</span></p>

            <p class="text">Rules governing <i>bris milah</i>, the
            circumcision ceremony, are strict. The boy must be
            exactly eight days old; he must be carried into the
            room by his godparents, preferably a couple who are
            trying for children themselves and then handed over
            into the arms of the guest of honour, the
            <i>sandak</i>, who will hold him while the mohel does
            his work.</p>

            <p class="text">"Initially, I resisted the suggestion
            of becoming a circumciser," Sifman recalls. "It still
            makes me uneasy that what I do is being assessed by
            standards other than merely medical." Which, put
            bluntly, means he doesn't like guests coming up to him
            over the post-circumcision Twiglets and commenting on
            how much - or how little - noise the baby made during
            the operation. For whereas a dab-handed Anglican priest
            can christen some children without making them cry, no
            <i>mohel</i> can expect to practice his art without at
            least few deafening screams from the person at the
            sharp end.</p>

            <p class="text">The potentially distressing nature of
            the ceremony is the reason why pregnant women aren't
            allow to be godmothers, in case the shock makes them
            miscarry. During the actual cutting, women and men tend
            to stand in separate groups, and, as the blade does its
            work, the baby's are by no means the only eyes in the
            room that are watering.</p>

            <p class="text">Dr Sifman defends the lack of
            pain-relief on both medical and religious grounds.
            Although the operation undoubtly hurts, he says it
            presents less risk to an eight-day-old child than local
            or general anaesthetic. <span>Just as valid in some his
            eyes, too, are the religious laws, which make no
            prevision for any administering of painkillers.</span>
            People who say "live" circumcision is cruel do no, he
            says, appreciate the full spiritual significance of the
            event. For the removal of the foreskin symbolizes the
            removal of a barrier between man and God. This stems
            from the belief that Adam was born without his
            foreskin, which grew only after his fall from
            grace.</p>

            <p class="text">"Circumcision is the one tradition that
            nearly all Jews maintain, however many others they may
            throw out of the window," says Dr Sifman.</p>

            <p class="text">Certainly, he sees his circumcising
            activities as a social and spiritual duty, rather than
            some kind of medical service (he gives any payments he
            receives to charity). The majority of Britain's 46
            <i>mohalim</i> are laymen; many Orthodox Jews refuse to
            use a medically qualified mohel, in case people might
            think that their motives were anything other than
            purely religious.</p>

            <p class="text">The oldest person Dr Sifman has ever
            "done" was 72 years old; the man was a convert to
            Judaism, and an anaesthetic was used, as it is with
            everyone more than three months old. The largest number
            of people he circumcised in one short period of time
            was several hundred Russians. Now that Communism is no
            longer peeking into homes and trousers, the practice is
            in great demand.</p>

            <p class="text"><span>Tradition has it that when a
            <i>mohel</i> dies, he is buried along the dried-up
            foreskins he has removed. Would Dr Sifman, who keeps
            all of his foreskins, like to go the same way? "Let's
            just say I'm considering it," he smiles,
            noncommittally&mdash;but in a voice that makes you sure
            he'd like nothing better.</span></p>
