      <h2>6,000 Girls Reportedly Circumcised Every Day</h2>
      Fri Mar 8,10:30 AM ET By Tom Miles 

      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - About 6,000 girls a day undergo genital
      mutilation, often willingly, and up to 115 million African
      women have already had it, US-based development agency <a
      href="http://www.worldvision.org/worldvision/master.nsf/">World
      Vision</a> said on Thursday.</p>

      <p class="body">And bizarre beliefs abound about female
      genital mutilation (FGM), such as, if a woman is not
      circumcised, her husband will die; she will give birth to an
      abnormal baby, or her genitals may grow to an enormous
      size.</p>

      <p class="body">These tales have helped perpetuate the
      practice in more than 30 countries, Fatuma Hashi, the
      report's author, said.</p>

      <p class="body">"The worst perpetrators of FGM are women
      themselves," Hashi said, adding that girls fear being
      ostracized and older women cling to tradition, unaware of the
      health risks.</p>

      <p class="body">FGM is a cultural practice with roots
      predating the spread of the major religions. Nevertheless,
      "erroneous beliefs that the Christian Bible and the Muslim
      Koran demand it are widespread," Hashi said.</p>

      <p class="body">The report highlighted cases in Ethiopia,
      Kenya and Ghana, and described a Kenyan woman ordering her
      twin daughters to shower in ice-cold water in preparation for
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="body">"With the freezing water's numbing effect
      serving as the only form of anesthesia, Mary sits akimbo on a
      sheepskin, her limbs clamped down by other women to
      discourage even the slightest movement to prevent
      unintentional cutting.</p>

      <p class="body">"In an operation that lasts several minutes,
      an elderly woman takes several swipes at Mary's genitals
      using a sharp razor blade."</p>

      <p class="body">Cultures which practiced FGM gave many
      reasons for it, including preserving virginity, enhancing
      personal hygiene or attractiveness, easing childbirth and
      achieving status for the girl or her father.</p>

      <p class="body">Types of FGM ranged from clitoridectomy to
      infibulation, in which the clitoris and labia minora are
      removed and the labia majora are pinned together with catgut
      or thorns, leaving only a pinhole opening for urine and
      menstrual blood.</p>

      <p class="body">Infibulation, also called "pharaonic"
      circumcision, leaves scar tissue which must be cut open
      before intercourse and the birth of each child.</p>

      <p>Apart from the short-term consequences of FGM such as
      extreme pain, blood loss, gangrene and infections, many girls
      went on to suffer pain during sexual intercourse,
      infertility, incontinence, depression and <a
      href="/library/psych/menage/">long-term psychological
      problems</a>.</p>

      <p class="body">It sometimes caused death from hemorrhage,
      blood poisoning, urine retention or led to <a
      href="/library/disease/HIV/brady1/">HIV infection</a>.</p>

      <p class="body">FGM could also lead to problems at
      childbirth, and many women suffered constant bleeding, slow
      sexual arousal and an inhibited orgasm, or no orgasm at
      all.</p>

      <p class="body">"Sex and suffering become synonymous to
      females both young and old," the report said. "Having no
      acceptable way of addressing their feelings, these girls and
      women mostly suffer in silence."</p>

      <p class="body">The report quoted an official of an African
      community education group as saying half the battle was to
      convince traditional midwives, who birth over 80% of Africa's
      babies and who are trusted by mothers.</p>

      <p class="body">"It's the midwives who either circumcise
      girls themselves, or encourage mothers to circumcise
      daughters," the official said.</p>
