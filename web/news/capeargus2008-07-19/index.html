            <h2>'Circumcision can lead to mental illness'</h2>

            <p><b>Melanie Peters</b><br />
             July 19 2008 at 11:29AM</p>

            <p>A 21-year-old Langa law student looked forward to
            his rite of passage to manhood but two weeks after his
            circumcision at an initiation school in the bush he had
            a psychotic episode and was admitted to a psychiatric
            hospital.<br />
            <br />
             In another case, a 26-year-old man earned the money in
            Cape Town for his initiation and then returned to the
            Eastern Cape for the ceremony. But back in the city his
            life spiralled out of control.<br />
            <br />
             He was dismissed from work for trying to stab a
            co-worker, and within a year of the rite was admitted
            to a psychiatric hospital and diagnosed with
            schizophrenia. These are two case studies taken from
            the PhD thesis of medical anthropologist Lauraine
            Vivian, titled Psychiatric Disorder in Xhosa-speaking
            Men following Circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             Vivian explored the mental histories of five young
            men, who each suffered from acute psychotic episodes
            after initiation ceremonies.<br />
            <br />
             She is based at <a href="http://www.health.uct.ac.za/"
            target="_blank">UCT medical school</a>'s Primary Health
            Care Directorate.<br />
            <br />
             Her thesis examined how stress and anxiety related to
            personal, social and cultural factors, could possibly
            trigger the onset of a psychotic illness in vulnerable
            young men with a predisposition to such illness.<br />
            <br />
             Circumcision and illegal initiation schools again made
            headlines in the news this month.<br />
            <br />
             The circumcision death toll in the Eastern Cape has
            reached at least 20 so far this season, the <a
            href="http://www.ecdoh.gov.za/"
            targec="_blank">provincial health department</a>
            said.<br />
            <br />
             Another 72 initiates were admitted to hospitals in the
            region, suffering from dehydration or septic
            wounds.<br />
            <br />
             Vivian said as an anthropologist she had great respect
            for the Xhosa custom but there was a need to ensure the
            rights of these young men were protected and the
            practice was carried out safely.<br />
            <br />
             "Our <a
            href="http://www.info.gov.za/documents/constitution/1996/index.htm"
             target="_blank">Constitution</a> protects the rights
            of all these young men. The onus is on the health
            system to ensure that cultural practices do not turn
            abusive."<br />
            <br />
             She graduated this year after doing six years of
            research at a number of psychiatric institutions in the
            Western Cape, the Eastern Cape and the Northern
            Province.<br />
            <br />
             She screened over 50 patients who had suffered from
            various psychiatric illnesses linked to their
            circumcision but focused on five men.<br />
            <br />
             She interviewed traditional surgeons and community
            elders, and worked closely with a task team in the
            Eastern Cape.<br />
            <br />
             "At times it was distressing to hear what some of the
            young men had been through: how they were marginalised
            because they were mentally ill and received little care
            from their communities, who believed they were
            bewitched."<br />
            <br />
             Adolescence and the pathway to manhood was tough
            enough in itself. In the cases she looked at, there was
            evidence that a lack of family support, especially the
            absence of a father, played a major role in
            exacerbating the patients' stress and anxiety.<br />
            <br />
             "Evidence illustrated that the most significant
            stressor was when fathers did not fulfill their roles
            as required for their sons' circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             Because the father/son equation underpinned this
            patrilineal rite of passage, their psychological health
            and social relations were compromised, it highlighted
            the stresses, psychological harm, cultural dissonance,
            poverty and stigma they had suffered and indeed
            continued to endure."<br />
            <br />
             Ironically, she said, there was a local idiom that
            warned of possible mental illness in youth who were not
            circumcised to their fathers' line of descent.<br />
            <br />
             "As much as it was a warning, it counselled that
            fathers, mothers and families needed to engage with
            their sons at this potentially turbulent time in their
            sons' lives." All five of the men in Vivian's study
            went through their initiation without the support of
            their fathers.<br />
            <br />
             They also developed psychotic illnesses within one
            year of their circumcision. Two suffered brief
            episodes, which improved when their cultural experience
            had been addressed through therapy.<br />
            <br />
             Her work argues that in the cases of the five men,
            stressors involved in their circumcisions precipitated
            stress-related anxiety, and because they were
            vulnerable, this contributed to the onset of psychotic
            illness.<br />
            <br />
             They suffered from either schizophrenia, bipolar
            disorder or cultural bound syndrome (a disorder brought
            on by cultural pressures).</p>
