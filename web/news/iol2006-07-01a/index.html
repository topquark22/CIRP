            <p>A 15-year-old boy died of "circumcision
            complications" in Flagstaff on Saturday, the Eastern
            Cape health department said.<br />
            <br />
             Spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said the initiate's death
            was the 13th reported case since the beginning of the
            province's initiation season.<br />
            <br />
             "This disturbing incident was discovered by officials
            who were dispatched to the mountains to monitor
            circumcision schools," he said.<br />
            <br />
             "A lot of bogus traditional surgeons are killing the
            boys in the name of custom... they are making the
            custom a laughing stock."</p>

            <table width="130" border="0" cellspacing="6"
            cellpadding="0" align="left" summary="">
              <tr>
                <td><b>'Bogus traditional surgeons'</b></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Kupelo said police were still searching for the
            unlawful circumcision school's traditional surgeon and
            his nurses.<br />
            <br />
             "Other boys are being assessed by officials to
            determine if they need medical treatment," he
            said.<br />
            <br />
             In total, six bogus traditional surgeons are on the
            run and 16 have been arrested.<br />
            <br />
             The latest arrest was made on Thursday after 21
            malnourished boys were found hidden in the Ntabankulu
            mountain.<br />
            <br />
             One of the boys, a 17-year-old who was still to be
            circumcised, was found dead.<br />
            <br />
             "We are pleading with the so-called traditional
            surgeons to stop circumcising young boys without
            permission," Kupelo said. - Sapa</p>
