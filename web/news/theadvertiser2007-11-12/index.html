            <h2>Cosmetic circumcision banned</h2>

            <p><i>JILL PENGELLEY, HEALTH REPORTER</i><br />
             November 12, 2007 01:15am</p>

            <p><b>CIRCUMCISION will be banned in the state's public
            hospitals unless it is for medical reasons.</b><br />
            <br />
             Health Minister John Hill today will announce an
            immediate ban on "cosmetic" circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             "The <a href="http://www.health.sa.gov.au/"
            target="_blank">Health Department</a> has a
            responsibility to ensure access to elective surgery is
            based on sound medical reasons," he said yesterday.
            "Cosmetic procedures such as liposuction, facelifts and
            male circumcision will only be provided if assessed and
            justified on true clinical grounds.<br />
            <br />
             "This will improve the demand on beds, clinical
            resources and theatre time."<br />
            <br />
             In the past financial year, 274 circumcisions were
            performed on children in the state's public hospitals.
            SA is the last state to take a stand against
            circumcision. "Both nationally and overseas, doctors
            agree there is no medical benefit to routine
            circumcision with the procedure as low as 2 per cent in
            the UK," Mr Hill said. "Parents who wish to have their
            son circumcised can still have the procedure done in
            private hospitals or private day centres."<br />
            <br />
             <a href="http://www.health.sa.gov.au/"
            target="_blank">Australian Medical Association</a>
            state president Peter Ford said circumcision was
            controversial and it was "not unreasonable" that other
            procedures take priority in a system under
            pressure.<br />
            <br />
             Patients already on the waiting list will still be
            able to have the surgery in the public system but
            anyone not allocated an appointment will not be
            eligible.<br />
            <br />
             Other procedures to be banned include breast
            enlargement or reduction, penile implant, hair
            transplant, facelift, gender re-assignment surgery and
            sterilisation reversal.<br />

             target="_blank">Queen Elizabeth Hospital</a> surgery
            director Guy Maddern said it was 30 years or more since
            most purely cosmetic work had been performed in public
            hospitals.<br />
            <br />
             "It's making it clear that operations will not be
            offered for cosmetic reasons but only for medically
            indicated reasons," he said.</p>
