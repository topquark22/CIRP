        <h2>Circumcised boys may sue</h2>
      </center>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Circumcision may
      violate baby boys's human rights and circumcised boys may be
      able to sue doctors and parents for their circumcision.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neville Turner,
      Professor of Law at Melbourne's <a
      href="http://www.monash.edu.au/" target="_blank">Monash
      University</a> and president of <a
      href="http://www.ozchild.org.au/" target="_blank">Oz
      Child</a>, is calling for Australia-wide legislation banning
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Doctors and nurses
      who perform circumcision on infants relying on the consent of
      parents are taking a grave risk," he warns.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For if it is
      ultimately declared to be a void consent, them it will have
      constituted an assault, and they could be civilly and
      criminally liable."</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Turner
      explains circumcision is contrary to article 24(3) of the <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">United Nations
      Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> which maintains
      "States parties shall take all effective and appropriate
      measures with a view to abolishing traditional practices
      prejudicial to the health of children."</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The procedure is
      unnecessary, painful, dangerous and barbarous," Professor
      Turner says.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can people
      perform this on little children who are screaming?"</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ethical
      consequences of male circumcision are highlighted in a <a
      href="/library/general/warren1/">letter</a> in the latest
      edition of the <i>British Medical Journal</i> from 20
      circumcised men claiming circumcision harmed them and it
      violates their human rights.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The men write "the
      United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states
      that children have rights to self determination, dignity,
      respect, integrity and non-interference and the right to make
      informed personal decisions."</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unnecessary
      circumcision violates these rights."</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The men also cite the
      <a href="/library/ethics/alderson/#hospital">European charter
      for children in hospital</a> which states that every child
      must be protected from unnecessary medical treatment.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Queensland Law
      Reform Commission's 1993 <a
      href="/library/legal/QLRC/">research paper</a> on
      circumcision confirms the possibility of circumcised boys
      suing doctors and parents.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It finds that on a
      strict interpretation of the assault provisions of the
      Queensland Criminal Code, routine circumcision would be
      regarded as a criminal act."</p>

      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"
          size="2">"Consent by parents to the procedure may be
          invalid in light of the common law's restrictions on the
          ability of parents to consent to non-therapeutic
          treatment of children."</font></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The paper states a
      child's ability to sue for circumcision "would ... be
      dependent on the absence of real consent."</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Turner says
      a High Court case ruling in 1992 ( <a
      href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high_ct/175clr218.html?query=title(175%20CLR%20218)"
       target="_blank">re Marion</a>) &ndash; that parents do not
      have the right to authorise non-therapeutic, irreversible
      operations for their child &ndash; could possible be applied
      to male circumcision.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a
      href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/" target="_blank">High
      Court</a> ruled that parents of an intellectually handicapped
      child do not have the right to consent to the child's
      sterilisation, and only the <a
      href="http://www.familycourt.gov.au/presence/connect/www/home/"
       target="_blank">Family Court of Australia</a> can consent to
      to such operations (except in NSW and SA where special
      procedures apply).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though the High
      Court case concerns only sterilisation, Professor Turner says
      "there are plenty of comments in the judgement to suggest the
      same principle could extend to other operations not designed
      to preserve a child's health."</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Peter
      Phelan, President of the Australian College of Paediatrics,
      released a <a
      href="/library/statements/acp1996/">statement</a> earlier
      this month acknowledging the potential legal and human rights
      implications of male circumcision but he refused to condemn
      or support the procedure.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Keith Woollard,
      chairman of the <a href="/library/statements/ama2/">AMA</a>'s
      ethics committee has "no doubt" male circumcision is a
      growing legal and ethical problem.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Having looked at
      both sides of the argument, my own view is that there not
      sufficient evidence to justify it as a routine surgical
      procedure on otherwise healthy people.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The QLD Law Reform
      Commission report raised the possibility of men suing their
      doctors and parents for their circumcision. If the medical
      profession believes there are no good medical implications
      for this procedure, then where is the legal basis for doing
      it?"</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Woollard says
      there has been an enormous shift in the number of boys
      circumcised today compared with decades ago when it was the
      norm.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is believed around
      40 per cent of boys were circumcised in Australia in 1980.
      Today, less than 20 per cent are circumcised.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The medical
      profession themselves have walked away from it. Dr Woollard
      says.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to
      Professor Turner "there is evidence that many men suffer
      negative psychological effects and possibly long lasting
      psychological damage."</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Male circumcision is
      still commonly practised by Muslim and Jewish
      communities.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Dr. Woollard
      cautions the debate "mustn't degenerate into some sort of
      criticism of Jewish and Muslim faiths."</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is only when it is
      performed for non-religious reasons that we need to be
      discussing it at the moment, he says.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 20 men urge
      British paediatric urologists to produce guidelines advising
      how foreskin problems can be managed.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Preferably," they
      write, "circumcision should not be done until the patient or
      adult is old enough to understand what is intended; then he
      has a right to a full, illustrated explanation of the nature
      of the operation and the reasons for it in advance, with the
      opportunity to ask questions, and help in coming to terms
      with the alteration of his anatomy afterwards."</p>

      <h3>Foreskin's future: to cut or not to cut</h3>

      <p>The case for:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>a reduced incidence of urinary tract infections in
        infants. Such infections are rare.</li>

        <li>Lower incidence of sexually transmitted diseases. Dr
        Woollard says there is evidence in overseas societies,
        particularly in Africa, of lower instances of sexually
        transmitted diseases including HIV in circumcised men.</li>

        <li>There is no evidence in Australia that is the case, he
        says.</li>

        <li>It is believed that this is simply a function of
        personal hygiene - in situations where personal hygiene is
        adequate the foreskin is not risk factor for sexually
        transmitted diseases.</li>

        <li>Reduced cancer of the foreskin. Cancer of the foreskin
        is extremely uncommon. "It is a bit like advocating
        mastectomy because some women might get breast cancer", Dr
        Woollard says.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The case against:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Circumcision can cause death from bleeding. "This is
        extremely rare."</li>

        <li>Anaesthetic risks.</li>

        <li>It is painful and is still routinely performed without
        anaesthetic.</li>

        <li>It has little or no medical benefit.</li>

        <li>Slight risk of damage to the penis. According to
        Professor Turner "there is a case in NSW where a child who
        went in for a circumcision was castrated."</li>

        <li>The foreskin serves some useful function. According to
        Dr Woollard this has been argued in the US and Great
        Britain.</li>
