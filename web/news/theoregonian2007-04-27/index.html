            <h2>Divorced parents clash over 12-year-old son's
            circumcision</h2>

            <p><b>Three-year fight - The father, a convert to
            Judaism, sees it as a matter of religious
            observance</b></p>

            <p>Friday, April 27, 2007<br />
             ASHBEL S. GREEN</p>

            <p>A former Medford man who converted to Judaism wants
            his 12-year-old son to do the same. That requires
            circumcision -- something the mother adamantly
            opposes.</p>

            <p>The divorced couple has been battling over the issue
            for three years, including whether the boy wants to
            undergo the procedure. So far, Oregon courts have
            squarely sided with the father, who has custody.</p>

            <p>That doesn't surprise Kathy T. Graham, associate
            dean for academic affairs at <a
            href="http://www.willamette.edu/law/"
            target="_blank">Willamette University College of
            Law</a>.</p>

            <p>"The primary custodial parent is the one that makes
            the decisions about religion and education and about
            matters of child-rearing," Graham said.</p>

            <p>Other family law experts agree, but say the courts
            should at least look into the situation to make sure
            the surgery is in the best interests of the child.</p>

            <p>"You're talking about not just religious instruction
            or whether you're going to send the child to parochial
            school or public school," commented Lawrence D. Gorin,
            a Portland attorney. "This is a matter of permanent
            change of bodily structure. And it's irreversible."</p>

            <p>The mother is running out of legal options.</p>

            <p>The Oregon Supreme Court has been briefed, but has
            not decided whether to take the case.</p>

            <p>Mark Johnson, a Portland lawyer commenting on the
            case, said the court shouldn't let the case be decided
            based only on the legal papers filed on behalf of the
            mother and father.</p>

            <p>"Frankly, the child should have a lawyer," Johnson
            said.</p>

            <p>The Oregonian is not identifying the family members,
            in order to protect the privacy of the minor.</p>

            <p>The couple married in the early 1990s. She filed for
            divorce in 1998.</p>

            <p>The man started studying Judaism in 1999 and
            eventually converted. He now lives near Olympia. The
            child initially lived with his mother, but the father
            later gained custody.</p>

            <p>In court papers, the father claims the boy gradually
            concluded that he also wanted to convert to Judaism and
            understood that this required circumcision.</p>

            <p>The father also claims as the custodial parent he
            had a constitutional right to raise his son in his
            religion.</p>

            <p>The father made an appointment for a circumcision in
            2004.</p>

            <p>The mother responded by going to court, saying her
            son told her that he was afraid to defy his father, but
            didn't want the procedure.</p>

            <p>She asked for a hearing where she could present
            evidence that the circumcision would be dangerous. She
            also sought custody of her son.</p>

            <p>But Jackson County Circuit Judge Rebecca G. Orf
            sided with the father.</p>

            <p>"I am still of the opinion that the decision of
            whether or not a child has elective surgery, which this
            appears to be, is a call that should be made and is
            reserved to the custodial parent," Orf said in a
            hearing.</p>

            <p>More than a million U.S. infants are circumcised
            each year, but circumcising adults or teens remains
            relatively rare.</p>

            <p>Despite her ruling, Orf ordered the boy not be
            circumcised until the legal proceedings were done.</p>

            <p>The <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/coa/index.htm"
            target="_blank">Oregon Court of Appeals</a> affirmed
            Orf's decision without an opinion, often an indication
            that the three-judge panel found no merit to the
            appeal.</p>

            <p>The lawyer for the mother has asked the <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/index.htm"
             target="_blank">Oregon Supreme Court</a> to take the
            case, and gained an ally called <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>,
            which filed a brief last week.</p>

            <p>There is no schedule for when the court will decide
            whether to review the case.</p>

            <p>The mother's attorney declined to comment.</p>

            <p>The father, an attorney who is representing himself,
            did not return a phone call seeking comment.</p>

            <p>Oregon legal experts agree that judges generally
            defer to the choices of custodial parents.</p>

            <p>"Judges traditionally have stayed away in getting
            involving decisions about the day-to-day upbringing of
            the child," said Gorin, the Portland attorney.</p>

            <p>Still, there are limits.</p>

            <p>"It may be that the religious belief is to engage in
            human sacrifice or kill animals, but we don't do that,"
            he said.</p>

            <p>But Julie H. McFarlane, a supervising attorney with
            the Portland-based <a href="http://www.jrplaw.org/"
            target="_blank">Juvenile Rights Project</a>, said that
            the child's consent for a medical procedure is not
            required until he turns 15.</p>

            <p>"I think the dad has the legal right as the
            custodial parent to make those kind of religious or
            medical decisions," McFarlane said. "It's not much
            different from cosmetic surgery."</p>

            <p>The bottom line, McFarlane said, is that "when you
            lose custody, you lose a lot of those things that go
            with custody -- deciding whether the kids go to school
            and the rest of the day-to-day parenting
            decisions."</p>
