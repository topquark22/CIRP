            <h2>Circumcision a 'violation of child's rights'</h2>
            October 12 2005 at 04:09AM 

            <p>By Janine Stephen</p>

            <p>A group of men caused a stir in parliament on
            Tuesday by calling for an end to all circumcision of
            baby boys - or anyone under 18 years old.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.nocirc-sa.co.za/"
            target="_blank">The National Organisation of
            Circumcision Information Resource Centres South
            Africa</a> (NOCIRC-SA) is fighting for boys' rights to
            retain their foreskins. They say that circumcision
            without consent is a "violation of a child's
            rights".</p>

            <p>They are supported by a number of other local and
            international organisations, including the <a
            href="http://www.icgi.org"
            target="_blank">International Coalition of Genital
            Integrity</a>, <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a> and
            the <a href="http://www.norm-sa.co.za/"
            target="_blank">National Organisation of Restoring
            Men</a> (NORM).</p>

            <p>'Male circumcision should not be isolated from
            female circumcision' The select committee on social
            development was holding public hearings into the
            Children's Bill, which outlaws female genital
            mutilation and virginity testing.</p>

            <p>Under the proposed Bill, which has already been
            approved by the national Assembly, anyone who practises
            female genital mutilation or virginity testing is
            guilty of an offence and can be imprisoned for up to 10
            years.</p>

            <p>"Male circumcision should not be isolated from
            female circumcision," Dean Ferris of NOCIRC said.</p>

            <p>This is unlikely to go down well with Jewish,
            Islamic and Xhosa groups, all of which see circumcision
            as an essential part of their cultures.</p>

            <p>According to a <a
            href="http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/ci/"
            target="_blank">Children's Institute</a> discussion
            paper on the Children's Bill, if a child is old enough
            to give consent, then the boy has the right to say no.
            Forcing a child to be circumcised is a criminal
            offence. The bill is silent on the age for consent.</p>

            <p>However, circumcising baby boys who are too young to
            give consent, is not outlawed.</p>

            <p>A written statement submitted to the select
            committee by NORM states that: "As children, we were
            unable to voice our objections to halt these ritual
            genital mutilations that were carried out on us in
            hospitals and beyond.</p>

            <p>"We are now able as adults to loudly and
            unreservedly condemn such sexual abuse."</p>

            <p>Ferris said that the <a
            href="http://www.samedical.org/" target="_blank">South
            African Medical Association</a> has said that there is
            no need for circumcision from a medical point of
            view.</p>

            <p>"It's a human issue," said paediatrician Dr Daniel
            Sidler. "It's about the integrity of the genitals.
            We're fiddling with normal and healthy genitals."</p>
