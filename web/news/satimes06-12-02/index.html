            <p>THE National House of Traditional Leaders has
            expressed concern about the number of deaths that occur
            during iniation rituals, a Xhosa tradition whereby
            teenage boys are circumcised to become men.</p>

            <p>The amakhosi said it had compiled a discussion paper
            and asked the Health Department for an imbizo. Causes
            of death were incompetent doctors, "surgeons who fail
            to abstain from sexual relations before the ritual,"
            lack of government support, unsterilised instruments
            and schools more concerned about money than the
            initiating process.<br />
