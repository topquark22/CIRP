            <h2>Child dies in circumcision</h2>

            <p>AN ELEVEN-year-old boy died in circumcision believed
            to be infected with tetanus.<br />
            <br />
             Lydia Amantillo, grandmother of the victim Gino Erojo,
            told <i>Sun.Star</i> that her grandson experienced high
            fever few hours after he was circumcised on July
            24.<br />
            <br />
             Erojo, a native of Panciao, Manjuyod, Negros Oriental
            and a grade 5 pupil of Lucay Elementary School, availed
            the free circumcision in a medical mission sponsored by
            Representative Jocelyn Limkaichong in the first
            congressional district of the province.<br />
            <br />
             The victim's family blamed the "unsanitized" equipment
            causing the infection.<br />
            <br />
             The child was rushed to Negros Oriental Provincial
            Hospital on July 31, but died around 9:45 p.m.
            Sunday.<br />
            <br />
             The child's family, although blaming the doctor, said
            they have no plans to sue anybody for the victim's
            death.<br />
            <br />
             The family also said they do not blame the medical
            mission sponsored by the Limkaichong.<br />
            <br />
             However, Amantillo said they appeal to the concerned
            persons to be extra careful in handling the process of
            circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             They also asked Limkaichong and other government
            agencies to help them pay the hospital bills, embalming
            expenses and transport of the child's body from
            Dumaguete City to their home in Manjuyod town.<br />
            <br />
             Manjuyod is more than 58 kilometers north of Dumaguete
            City. (VLC)</p>
