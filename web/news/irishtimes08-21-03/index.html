            <h2>Garda&iacute; seek man who carried out circumcision
            on baby who died</h2>

            <p>Eithne Donnellan and Carol Duffy<br />
            21/08/2003</p>

            <p>Garda&iacute; were last night trying to trace a man
            who circumcised a baby boy at the child's home in
            Waterford city at the weekend. The boy, who was just 29
            days old, died within hours of the operation, having
            suffered severe blood loss.</p>

            <p>The child was born to Nigerian parents at Waterford
            Regional Hospital last month. The family wanted the boy
            circumcised within six weeks of his birth for religious
            reasons.</p>

            <p>It is not clear if they sought the operation at the
            local hospital, but even if they did, Waterford
            Regional Hospital does not provide male circumcisions
            on religious or cultural grounds.</p>

            <p>The Irish <a href="http://www.icgp.ie/"
            target="_blank">College of General Practitioners</a>
            wrote to the South Eastern Health Board earlier this
            year expressing concern about the health board's
            failure to provide this service in Waterford.</p>

            <p>The garda&iacute; became involved in the case when
            the four-week-old boy died at Waterford Hospital in the
            early hours of Monday morning, having been rushed there
            from his home. Detectives found no visible marks on the
            infant's body but a post-mortem examination was
            ordered.</p>

            <p>Sgt P&aacute;draig Dunne of Waterford Garda station
            said the post-mortem had been carried out by Dr
            Margaret Bolster from the State pathologist's office
            but the results had so far been inconclusive.</p>

            <p>"We are at present investigating the tragic
            circumstances that led up to the death of a
            four-week-old infant in the early hours of Monday
            morning at Waterford Regional Hospital," Sgt Dunne
            said. "A post-mortem was carried out but to date the
            results have been inconclusive about the cause of
            death.</p>

            <p>"However, we are continuing to investigate the
            circumstances that led up to the tragic loss of the
            life of this young child," he added.</p>

            <p>A number of people, including the child's parents,
            who are understood to have two other children, have
            been interviewed by garda&iacute;.</p>

            <p>"A lot of people have been interviewed in relation
            to the incident and we are continuing to interview
            people at present," Sgt Dunne said.</p>

            <p>The man who carried out the operation is believed to
            have travelled to Waterford from Dublin on Sunday.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.sehb.ie/"
            target="_blank">South Eastern Health Board</a>, in a
            statement, confirmed a 29-day- old baby boy was brought
            to Waterford Regional Hospital early on Monday. "The
            baby subsequently died and the health board has
            referred the case to the coroner's office and to the
            garda&iacute;," it said.</p>
