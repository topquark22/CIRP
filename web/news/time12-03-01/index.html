      <h3>The Last Rites</h3>

      <h4>For centuries women have suffered in traditional African
      circumcision rituals. Now women's movements are trying to
      stop these dangerous ceremonies</h4>

      <p><b>BY SIMON ROBINSON/NAIROBI</b></p>

      <p>Monday, Nov. 26, 2001<br />
       Massita, 61, takes a piece of old cloth from her battered
      white purse, unfolds it and gingerly lays out seven miniature
      knives. The crude blades are nicked, the wooden handles worn.
      An older woman sitting next to her leans over and taps the
      knives twice with the fingers of her right hand, then touches
      her forehead. This is to avoid eye problems after looking at
      the knives, she says. Massita picks up one knife and explains
      how it is used to remove the clitorises of young women. Her
      mother did the same job before her, she says. And her
      grandmother. "These are the very knives they used."</p>

      <p>The <a
      href="http://www.oms.ch/frh-whd/FGM/index.htm">World Health
      Organization</a> estimates more than 100 million women
      worldwide have been circumcised - that is, had part or all of
      their clitoris, labia or vulva cut out. The practice, now
      commonly called female genital mutilation (FGM), is most
      widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in the <a
      href="/pages/female/pieters1/">Horn of Africa</a>, where up
      to 98% of girls are circumcised, and in Islamic populations
      in the continent's west. It is also found in Christian
      countries like Ethiopia and Kenya.</p>

      <p>"It doesn't matter whether it's Christian, Muslim or
      whatever," says Zipporah Kittony, a Kenyan M.P. and chairman
      of the Kenyan women's lobby group <a
      href="http://www.fgmkenya.org/m_o.html">Maendeleo Ya
      Wanawake</a> (Progress for Women). "It's cultural and it's
      commonplace."</p>

      <p>But attitudes toward FGM are slowly changing. In a quiet
      revolution, African women are beginning to speak out against
      the practice. Media campaigns linking such rituals to
      difficulties in pregnancy and AIDS have slowed the custom,
      especially in urban areas. The growing number of educated
      women has helped too.</p>

      <p>In the countryside, success is coming not by abolishing
      coming-of-age rites altogether but by recognizing their
      importance and replacing the cutting with alternative
      rituals. "In some tribes you cannot become a mature woman
      unless you have come through the ritual," says Kittony, whose
      group has used alternative rites to reduce the incidence of
      FGM in some parts of Kenya by up to 15%. "So we teach these
      women to be role models rather than circumcisers. They teach
      the girls maturity, they counsel them."</p>

      <p>An alternative rite of passage, which in one Kenyan
      language is known as circumcision through words, commonly
      involves a period of seclusion for the girls. Elder women
      teach them health issues including the dangers of aids and
      other sexually transmitted diseases. Sometimes a group of
      girls is taken to a local school or hall and shown films
      about the dangers of FGM. The week often ends with a party.
      "We are not against people's customs, we are against the
      cutting," says Traor&eacute; Dosso Mariam, secretary-general
      of the Ivorian Association for the Defence of Women's Rights,
      which encourages alternative rituals.</p>

      <p>The idea is spreading. Last year more than 100 former
      circumcisers from across Africa grouped together and agreed
      to put down their knives and razor blades for good. Now they
      instruct rural women on health and childbirth. "We teach [the
      circumcisers] a trade that responds to their economic needs,"
      Gambian Fatou Waggeh, an anti-FGM campaigner who was
      circumcised at 15 and is now 32, told a Rome conference in
      March. "[We] recognize that we must provide them with
      alternatives for training and [keeping their] power within
      the community."</p>

      <p>Pressure for change is also coming from governments. At
      least eight sub- Saharan African nations including Ghana,
      Ivory Coast, Kenya and Senegal have passed legislation or
      announced presidential decrees banning FGM. Africa's courts
      are also getting tougher. In a <a
      href="/news/ION01-24-01/">historic ruling</a> last December,
      a Kenyan court issued an order preventing a father from
      forcing his daughters, aged 15 and 17, to undergo
      circumcision. Women's groups across Africa applauded the
      ruling.</p>

      <p>"You can talk to these women all you want about the
      human-rights side of it, or the danger to the girls. <b>But
      it's the threat of being arrested that has an effect," says
      Drissa Kon&eacute;, a 29-year-old community health worker in
      northern Ivory Coast. "Let one woman in this region be
      arrested for performing excisions, and watch how fast they
      stop doing it."</b></p>

      <p>Still, prosecutions remain rare. And unless laws are
      strictly enforced they may even do more harm than good. In
      some places the threat of punishment has pushed the practice
      underground, leading to an increased possibility of botched
      operations. In Odienn&eacute;, northwestern Ivory Coast,
      festivities surrounding the excision ritual are now modest
      affairs. "People used to hold great f&ecirc;tes," says Mabana
      Tour&eacute;, 37. "Streets were blocked off, there was music
      and the girls would run around town all made-up and dressed
      in special clothes. Now, we might have a special meal
      together in the house - something much more discreet, because
      people are scared."</p>

      <p>Elsewhere, elders continue to encourage circumcisions
      because the custom provides an important social and economic
      role. Families in the Sabaot tribe in Kenya, for instance,
      receive cows upon the circumcision of their first girl. And
      alternative ceremonies can cause problems of their own. Julie
      Maranya, coordinator of a Kenyan anti-fgm group, says that
      because young girls are being taught sex education as part of
      their alternative initiation, "they think they are now free
      to engage in pre-marital sex. That's why we have made many
      tiny mothers."</p>

      <p>But as it slowly becomes more common for young women to
      shun circumcision, the heavy stigma of being "uncut" is
      fading. Ivorian Banassiri Sylla, 34, recalls the day 26 years
      ago when she was to be circumcised. "I remember the blade.
      How it shone! There was a woman kneeling over me with the
      knife. I bit her; it was all I could do. Then three women
      came to hold me down. One of them sat on my chest. I bit her
      with all my might." The women finally let Sylla go, but her
      uncut status was a mark of shame for her family. "Never, ever
      would I do this to my daughters," she says. "It strips a
      woman of her very womanhood."</p>

      <p>Even circumciser Massita realizes the changing times. None
      of her daughters has shown an interest in taking up the
      family trade. When she dies, she says, she will have her
      knives buried with her.</p>
