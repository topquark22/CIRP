            <h2>Man accused of unlawful circumcision</h2>

            <p>DALLAS, n.c. | Investigators say a man has been
            charged with child abuse in <a
            href="http://www.caldwellcountync.org/"
            target="_blank">Caldwell County</a> for circumcising
            his two infant sons with a utility knife.<br />
            <br />
             Authorities said 32-year-old Johnny Eric Marlowe
            fathered children with his legal wife and another woman
            who live in their home. One gave birth to a boy at
            their home in the rural Kings Creek community in
            November 2005, and the other gave birth to a boy there
            four months later.<br />
            <br />
             <a href="http://caldwellsheriff.org/"
            target="_blank">Caldwell County Sheriff</a>'s Detective
            Shelly Hartley said Marlowe denied the women prenatal
            care in both cases and circumcised the boys when they
            were 8 days old.<br />
            <br />
             Marlowe later moved to <a
            href="http://www.co.gaston.nc.us/"
            target="_blank">Gaston County</a> and is serving a
            150-day jail sentence there on charges of resisting a
            public officer, assault on a female and multiple counts
            of child neglect.<br />
            <br />
             Marlowe had a total of 11 children with the two
            women.</p>
