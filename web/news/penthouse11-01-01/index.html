      <h1>THE PENIS PAGE</h1>

      <p class="1">FACTS AND PHALLUSES OF<br />
      AMERICA'S FAVORITE ORGAN</p>

      <p class="2">By Sharon Chester-Taxin</p>

      <p class="2">David Llewellyn became involved in "penile law"
      when he brought a lawsuit for wrongful circumcision.</p>

      <p class="3">William Stowell lay flat on his back, naked from
      the waist down. He had been strapped to a board, his arms and
      legs stretched apart. A man hovered over the infant, took
      hold of Stowell's penis, lifted part of its glans and sliced
      the piece off. Stowell must have been in excruciating pain;
      he'd been given no anesthetic. His heart rate surged and his
      cortisol level rose to such a degree it equaled that of
      someone being tortured.</p>

      <p class="4">Now, 19 years later, Stowell wants the man who
      did this to pay.</p>

      <p class="4">Is this a scene from an NC-17 horror flick?
      Would you be surprised to find out that procedures like this
      occur regularly in countless hospitals and homes throughout
      the United States? They're called circumcisions.</p>

      <p class="4">"Oh," you might be saying now. "Then what's the
      big deal?" Well, to a growing number of men (and women) it
      <i>is</i> a big deal. It certainly is to Stowell, who, upon
      turning 18 in December of last year, filed a lawsuit in New
      York for damages in excess of $75,000 against Frank P.
      Cariello, the obstetrician who circumcised him, and against
      <a
      href="http://www.webspan.net/~goodsam/GoodSamHosp.html">Good
      Samaritan Hospital</a> in West Islip, New York, where the
      procedure took place. Stowell is not suing for medical
      malpractice. No one claims that the physician negligently
      performed the circumcision. The suit is for battery, defined
      as an "offensive touching" under the law, for performing the
      procedure that was not medically necessary, and for fraud,
      claiming that the surgery was done without proper consent.
      Stowell's mother signed the consent form, but, she says she
      did so while under the influence of Demerol and other drugs
      administered to help ease her pain after delivering her son
      by Caesarian section.</p>

      <p class="4">"For someone with a foreskin, the advantages are
      self-evident," says Stowell's attorney, David Llewellyn,
      noting that the foreskin provides its owner with vital
      sensory, protective, and sexual functions throughout his
      life. Llewellyn, an <a
      href="http://firms.findlaw.com//llewellynlaw/practices.htm">attorney
      from Conyers, Georgia</a>, who's been practicing law for 21
      years, is also an anti-circumcision advocate. He says that a
      circumcision is by no means a risk-free procedure. (Some of
      the dangers include excessive bleeding, infection, scarring,
      curvature of the penis, impotence, and even death.) Llewellyn
      became involved in "penile" law in 1995, when he brought a
      lawsuit against a doctor in Alabama for wrongful
      circumcision. (This landed his client a jury verdict and a
      record $65,000 in damages.) In that case the mother told the
      doctor not to circumcise her son, but the physician went
      ahead with the procedure anyway. Llewellyn is currently
      handling 21 circumcision cases throughout the United
      States.</p>

      <p class="4">"[Stowell's lawsuit] is the first time a young
      man upon turning 18 has decided to sue his circumciser,"
      remarks Llewellyn. "This landmark case raises the questions
      of whether a parent can give consent at all for a surgery
      that is merely cosmetic in nature, and whether a physician
      should be permitted to perform a nontherapeutic operation on
      a minor."</p>

      <p class="4">In 1985 nurse Marilyn Milos founded the <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/">National Organization of
      Circumcision Information Resource Centers</a>, an
      organization that provides education and information about
      circumcision. "We're trying to educate people in a
      foreskin-phobic society about normal penile anatomy," says
      Milos. "If the foreskin is removed, what is left of the head
      of the glans is not as sensitive, and only responds to deep
      pressure stimulation."</p>

      <p class="4">"The excuse for circumcision has always been
      consistent with the disease of the time," says attorney J.
      Steven Svoboda, executive director of <a
      href="http://www.arclaw.org/">Attorneys for the Rights of the
      Child</a>, a California-based legal-support center for
      matters relating to circumcision and other human-rights
      issues.</p>

      <p class="4">Throughout history, claims have been made that
      circumcision can aid in hygiene, prevent certain form of
      cancer, ever curb masturbation. But none of this has ever
      been medically proved, and in 1999 the American Academy of
      Pediatrics concluded that "potential medical benefits of
      newborn-male circumcision are not sufficient to recommend
      routine neonatal circumcision."</p>

      <p class="4">So why does this procedure still take place?</p>

      <p class="4">"People with vested interests don't want to
      admit to themselves that they've been doing something bad for
      so many years," says Svoboda, who hopes that a victory in the
      Stowell case might bring a class-action suit against the
      hospital in the near future.</p>

      <p class="4">Says Llewellyn, "I would like to see the day
      arrive when hospitals no longer do routine circumcisions and
      little boys are left alone to develop the way nature
      intended."</p>
