      <h2>Conference hears calls for banning of circumcision</h2>
      Source: AAP|Published: Thursday December 7, 2:21 PM 

      <p>Male circumcision was a criminal sexual assault that
      should be banned in Australia in the same way as female
      genital mutilation, an international conference at <a
      href="http://www.usyd.edu.au/" target="_blank">Sydney
      University</a> heard today.</p>

      <p>A Queensland psychology professor told the Sixth
      International Symposium on Genital Integrity that the
      surgical removal of the foreskin, performed on 12 per cent of
      Australian infant boys today, could result in a range of
      psychological and sexual problems in adulthood, including
      post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

      <p>"Studies now demonstrate quite clearly that circumcision
      has long-term adverse consequences, not only physically but
      also sexually and psychologically," Professor Greg Boyle, of
      <a href="http://www.bond.edu.au/index.htm"
      target="_blank">Bond University</a>, said after addressing
      the conference.</p>

      <p>"Post-traumatic stress disorder does occur in a certain
      percentage of adult men who come to the realisation that they
      have suffered irreparable damage sexually as a result of
      circumcision during infancy.</p>

      <p>"To amputate a highly erogenous sexual tissue such as the
      foreskin is quite clearly a criminal sexual assault."</p>

      <p>Prof Boyle said circumcision was a violation of a child's
      human rights and should be considered an offence to be
      prosecuted through the courts.</p>

      <p>He said a precedent had been set by a <a
      href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/disp.pl/au/cases/cth/high_ct/175clr218.html?query=title(175%20CLR%20218)"
       target="_blank">1992 High Court ruling</a> that parents
      could not provide legal consent for an irreversible,
      non-therapeutic medical procedure performed on an
      unconsenting minor.</p>

      <p>Prof Boyle said he believed Australia was moving down the
      path of criminalising circumcision, with an increasing tide
      of litigation against doctors.</p>

      <p>In an out-of-court <a href="/news/perth1/">settlement</a>
      in Perth last December, a 24-year-old man received $360,000
      from a doctor who circumcised him as an infant, he said.</p>

      <p>Prof Boyle said it was a violation of Australia's
      anti-discrimination laws to ban female genital mutilation
      while failing to give boys the same protection.</p>

      <p>Australian historian Robert Darby said circumcision began
      in Australia during the 1890s, when it was seen as a cure for
      a number of ills, including masturbation, convulsions and
      diarrhoea. It became almost universal during the 1920s.</p>

      <p>However the popularity of the procedure appears to be on
      the wane, according to <a
      href="/library/statistics/Australia/">Medicare figures</a>,
      Prof Boyle said.</p>

      <p>He said the figures showed almost 95 per cent of
      Australian baby boys were circumcised during the 1950s and
      '60s, compared with 12 per cent today. The conference will
      hear tomorrow about progress made by the federally funded
      education program on female genital mutilation in
      Australia.</p>

      <p>Six NSW communities, from Egypt, Somalia, Ethiopia, Sierra
      Leone, Indonesia and the Sudan, were being targeted as at
      risk of female genital mutilation, the program's Juliana
      Nkrumah said today.</p>

      <p>Female genital mutilation is illegal in Australia under
      laws introduced in 1995.</p>
