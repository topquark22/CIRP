            <h2>Concern at unnecessary circumcision</h2>

            <p>Sunday 16 February 2003, 14:30PM</p>

            <p>Young boys may be undergoing unnecessary
            circumcisions for a condition that can be effectively
            treated with creams, according to a <a
            href="http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/178_04_170203/spi10278_fm.html"
             target="_blank">study</a>.</p>

            <p>The percentage of Australian boys being circumcised
            has fallen from 95 per cent in the 1930s to only 6.5
            per cent 20 years ago.</p>

            <p>However, a West Australian report, published in the
            <a href="http://www.mja.com.au/"
            target="_blank">Medical Journal of Australia</a> on
            Monday, reveals a high rate of circumcision for
            phimosis, a condition where the foreskin cannot be
            retracted, in boys under five.</p>

            <p>This is despite the condition - which can easily be
            confused with normal development of the penis - being
            rare among this age group.</p>

            <p><a href="mailto:skatrina@dph.uwa.edu.au">Dr Katrina
            Spilsbury</a>, of the <a href="http://www.uwa.edu.au/"
            target="_blank">University of Western Australia</a>'s
            <a
            href="http://www.meddent.uwa.edu.au/dph_new/index.htm"
            target="_blank">School of Population Health</a>,
            reviewed the circumcision of boys in the state's
            hospitals between 1981-1999.</p>

            <p>Boys aged five and under had the highest rate of
            surgery for phimosis, representing about 300
            circumcisions each year.</p>

            <p>More older boys were also being circumcised for
            phimosis, with a 70 per cent increase in the procedure
            among boys aged 10-14 during the period studied.</p>

            <p>"The past 19 years have seen a steady rise in the
            rate of medically indicated circumcision," Dr Spilsbury
            reports.</p>

            <p>"Most of the increase is the result of an increase
            in the rates of phimosis."</p>

            <p>Dr Spilsbury said if the current rate continued,
            about four per cent of boys would be circumcised for
            phimosis by the age of 15.</p>

            <p>This rate was seven times higher than the estimated
            occurrence of the condition, she said.</p>

            <p>"These findings imply a high rate of unnecessary
            surgery," writes <a
            href="mailto:Paddy.dewan@rch.org.au">Dr Paddy Dewan</a>
            of the <a
            href="http://www.rch.org.au/rch/index.cfm?doc_id=1495"
            target="_blank">Royal Children's Hospital</a> in
            Melbourne in an accompanying <a
            href="http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/178_04_170203/dew10610_fm.html"
             target="_blank">editorial</a>.</p>

            <p>Dr Dewan suggests the high rates might be the result
            of "manipulation", either by parents who want to
            circumcise their child for cosmetic reasons or <a
            href="/library/procedure/griffiths-frank/"
            target="_blank">GPs</a> who expect resistance from
            surgeons unless they give a medical reason for
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>Dr Spilsbury said phimosis could cause pain and
            urinary tract infections and was associated with sexual
            dysfunction and cancer in later life.</p>

            <p>However, there was <a
            href="/library/treatment/phimosis/dewan/">evidence</a>
            the use of steroid creams could reverse the situation
            in around four to six weeks, she said.</p>
