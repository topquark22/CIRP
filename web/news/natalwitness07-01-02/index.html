            <p><b>Child feared dead in new case</b></p>

            <p>Spokeswoman Annaline Prinsloo said a 17-year-old
            escaped from the school because he discovered that the
            boy sleeping next to him was dead.</p>

            <p>The boy claimed he had been kidnapped, assaulted and
            held at the school against his will.</p>

            <p>Police and emergency services officials visited the
            school to investigate and found 16 initiates. Two of
            them had septic circumcision wounds while several
            others had pneumonia.</p>

            <p>The escapee told the police that there were 18 boys
            at the school, including himself. Prinsloo said the
            police believe that one boy is missing. The dog unit
            will search the area today.</p>

            <p>The children were treated by emergency services at
            the scene but the teachers denied the police permission
            to remove the initiates. The children also refused to
            leave.</p>

            <p>Prinsloo said the school will be closed today and
            the children sent home.</p>

            <p>The 17-year-old was taken to Heidelberg hospital and
            treated for light injuries before being sent home to
            Vereeniging.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, a sixth person has been arrested in
            connection with last week's deaths at two initiation
            schools in Ratanda in the Heidelberg area. Prinsloo
            said a sangoma was arrested on Friday while he was
            trying to flee to Newcastle.</p>

            <p>He will appear in the Heidelberg Magistrate's Court
            today while five teachers, arrested last week, will
            appear in court for the second time on Wednesday. The
            five are charged with murder and assault with intent to
            do grievous bodily harm.</p>

            <p>The two initiation schools were closed down after
            five boys died of double pneumonia, multiple injuries
            sustained from a blunt instrument and septic
            circumcisions. More than 50 boys were admitted to
            hospital.</p>

            <p>By yesterday most of the boys had been released. Two
            initiates remained at the Heidelberg Hospital. One
            initiate was discharged from the Kopanong hospital and
            two remain there. Three initiates were still at
            Pholosong hospital.</p>

            <p>All of them are expected to be discharged in the
            next couple of days.</p>

            <p>In <a href="http://www.limpopo.gov.za/"
            target="_blank">Limpopo province</a>, eight initiation
            schools were closed on Friday and a school owner was
            arrested in connection with the death of a boy. More
            than 70 children were also hospitalised.</p>
