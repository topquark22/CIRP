            <h4>Male circumcision rates may plummet as a result of
            evidence-based medicine and a fear of litigation,
            writes Bob Beale.</h4>

            <p>THE fad for body modification - everything from
            modest tattoos to studded tongues - reflects an age-old
            aesthetic dissatisfaction with the bare essentials of
            human anatomy.</p>

            <p>For reasons that are both obvious and obscure, the
            penis has been singled out for particular
            attention.</p>

            <p>Despite its vital role in reproduction and pleasure
            - or perhaps because of it - the penis has been
            subjected to a battery of adornments and alterations.
            At various times and places, it has been lengthened,
            scarred, tattooed, padded, pierced with bars and rings,
            and even had objects inserted beneath its skin to give
            a bizarre lumpy texture.</p>

            <p>But the single most common and widespread penile
            modification has been circumcision, which goes back at
            least to ancient Egyptian times.</p>

            <p>Today, an estimated 15% of males - about 450 million
            individuals - have been circumcised, largely as a
            result of the procedure being medicalised since the
            19th century, according to the World Health
            Organization. And, as if to quote Macbeth - "If it were
            done when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done
            quickly" - the period soon after birth has found most
            favour.</p>

            <p>In Victorian times, circumcision was credited with
            all manner of medical and moral benefits, notably as a
            deterrent to masturbation and sexual pleasure
            seeking.</p>

            <p>Circumcision reached its pinnacle in the US in the
            early 1970s, when the rate rose to almost 80%, but it
            has since declined a little.</p>

            <p>In Australia and New Zealand, by contrast, only an
            estimated 10-15% of male infants are now routinely
            circumcised, according to the <a
            href="http://www.racp.edu.au/" target="_blank">Royal
            Australasian College of Physicians</a> (RACP). And the
            growing influence of evidence-based medicine seems set
            to send that rate lower still.</p>

            <p>A number of professional associations around the
            world have reviewed the risks and benefits of routine
            circumcision, concluding that it simply cannot be
            justified on scientific, ethical or socio-legal
            grounds.</p>

            <p>These bodies variously assert that circumcision
            constitutes unwarranted invasive surgery, or that no
            medical indications exist for its routine
            application.</p>

            <p>The RACP policy issued last September is
            representative. The college position was endorsed by
            the Australasian Association of Paediatric Surgeons,
            the New Zealand Society of Paediatric Surgeons, the <a
            href="http://www.urosoc.org.au/"
            target="_blank">Urological Society of Australasia</a>,
            the <a href="http://www.racs.edu.au/"
            target="_blank">Royal Australasian College of
            Surgeons</a> and the <a
            href="http://www.paediatrics.org.nz/"
            target="_blank">Paediatric Society of New
            Zealand</a>.</p>

            <p>Briefly, the policy notes increasing claims of
            health benefits from routine male circumcision,
            especially with regard to urinary tract infections, HIV
            and later cancer of the penis.</p>

            <p>The policy says that urinary tract infections in
            boys are uncommon - affecting at most 1-2% - and may be
            about five times less frequent in circumcised boys.</p>

            <p>But it says the evidence for a lower risk of
            acquisition of HIV "is conflicting, and can not be seen
            as an argument in favour of universal neonatal
            circumcision in countries with a low prevalence of
            HIV".</p>

            <p>It also notes that penile cancer has an incidence of
            around one per 100,000 in developed countries, and says
            "the rarity of the condition is such that universal
            circumcision is clearly not justified on these
            grounds", even though evidence suggests neonatal
            circumcision may reduce the risk 10-fold.</p>

            <p>And circumcision itself has a complication rate of
            1-5%, the RACP says. Complications include local
            infection, bleeding and damage to the penis, the
            college says. And, although rare, some complications
            can be severe indeed: bleeding, septicaemia and
            meningitis may occasionally cause death.</p>

            <p>The RACP policy concludes that "review of the
            literature in relation to risks and benefits shows
            &hellip; no evidence of benefit outweighing harm for
            circumcision as a routine procedure".</p>

            <p>However, the head of the anti-circumcision advocacy
            group <a href="http://www.circinfo.org/"
            target="_blank">No Circ Australia</a>, Dr George
            Williams, while endorsing the opposition to routine
            circumcision, has criticised the policy for what it
            fails to include.</p>

            <p>Dr Williams says the RACP policy has not warned
            doctors of a real and increasing <a
            href="/library/legal/boyle1/">danger of litigation</a>
            on the part of individuals who, without necessarily
            suffering complications, grow up and wish that they had
            not been circumcised.</p>

            <p>This point is already being considered in
            Canada.</p>

            <p>The College of Physicians and Surgeons of
            Saskatchewan, for example, recently <a
            href="/library/statements/sask2002/">warned doctors</a>
            to consider not only the physical risk to the patient
            but the legal risk to the physician before becoming
            involved in the routine circumcision of infants.</p>

            <p>The college said circumcisions should be performed
            only when medically indicated or, if sought for
            religious and cultural reasons, only after thorough
            discussion with parents to ensure that a legally
            defensible informed consent process had been
            followed.</p>

            <p>In the wake of such overwhelming opposition to
            routine circumcision, how is it then that 10-15% of
            Australian boys are still having the procedure
            done?</p>

            <p>Religious beliefs will account for a small
            proportion of these, with Jewish and Muslim people
            advocating circumcision.</p>

            <p>There are also medical indications. A recent WA <a
            href="http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/178_04_170203/spi10278_fm.html"
             target="_blank">study</a> in the MJA predicts that as
            many as 4% of all boys will be circumcised before the
            age of 15 for intractable phimosis. However, the
            researchers have called for a review of this indication
            as their study also found that half of these boys would
            have the operation before the age of five, despite
            severe phimosis being very rare in this age group.</p>

            <p>Then there are those doctors who remain staunch
            advocates of the procedure.</p>

            <p>Brisbane GP Terry Russell specialises in
            circumcision, performing about 2000 a year. He claims
            the procedure when done using the Plastibell and EMLA
            cream is safe and painless in infant boys and promotes
            health and hygiene.</p>

            <p>He claims the foreskin is redundant. It did perform
            a protective function when we were running around the
            jungle naked but these days it is no longer necessary,
            he says. "Males are better off without it."</p>

            <p>Dr Russell disputes much of the evidence for
            long-term detrimental effects of circumcision.</p>

            <p>"No-one's ever shown [circumcision] reduces
            sensitivity," he says. He cites a large US study in the
            late 90s which found a higher proportion of sexual
            dysfunction in uncircumcised males. He also dismisses
            the legal ramifications as ludicrous and suggests it
            might be the uncircumcised population that might be
            taking legal action.</p>

            <p>"Any patient who was advised against or denied
            circumcision on spurious grounds who then goes on to
            suffer one of the conditions that might reasonably have
            been prevented or minimised by circumcision has a right
            to damages from the person who advised against or
            denied the procedure," he suggests.</p>

            <p>Dr Russell has also criticised the RACP <a
            href="http://www.racp.edu.au/hpu/paed/circumcision/index.htm"
             target="_blank">policy</a>, saying it misrepresents
            the demographics of the procedure in Australia.</p>

            <p>He notes the policy incorrectly states that most
            circumcisions "are now performed under a general
            anaesthetic on boys older than six months", claiming
            Health Insurance Commission statistics over the past
            three years show that about 75% are performed under the
            age of six months.</p>

            <p>"The statement concerning demographics is so
            diametrically opposed to the truth and so demonstrably
            wrong that it must cast grave doubts on the whole
            policy statement, which is clouded in tones of grey,"
            Dr Russell told Medical Observer.</p>

            <p>So while the RACP's recent statement attempts to
            resolve the issue of circumcision, it would seem the
            debate looks set to continue for some time yet.
