            <h2>Four-year-old boy dies during ritual
            circumcision</h2>

            <p>&ldquo;It is a great shock for our hospital,&rdquo;
            a senior spokeswoman for the Children&rsquo;s
            Republican Hospital of Kazan, Damira Galeyeva said. The
            death of a four-year-old boy set the whole city in
            turmoil.<br />
            <br />
             Two four-year-old twin boys, Ilfat and Rifat Zarimovs,
            were hospitalized for the operation of ritual
            circumcision. The children were thoroughly examined
            prior to the operation. Doctors operated Ilfat first,
            and the operation went through successfully. Rifat died
            as a result of the operation.<br />
            <br />
             &ldquo;The examination conducted before the operation
            did not reveal any contraindications. The doctor who
            gave the boy the narcosis is a specialist of a higher
            category who has a very extensive work experience. His
            qualification does not raise any doubts. Our hospital
            has up-to-date equipment for anesthesiology and
            reanimation. The doctors spent 2.5 hours reanimating
            the boy, but they failed to save him,&rdquo; Galeyeva
            said.<br />
            <br />
             The doctor added that one will have to conduct
            independent expertise to find out the cause of the
            boy&rsquo;s death.<br />
            <br />
             &ldquo;We have received a permission from the Office
            of the Public Prosecutor to conduct independent
            expertise. For the time being, there are no official
            results about the autopsy and conclusions made by
            forensic experts regarding the cause of death and the
            chemical composition of the used medications. The
            results can be received after a detailed
            investigation,&rdquo; Damira Galeyeva said.<br />
            <br />
             <a href="/library/death/" target="_blank">Incidents of
            death as a result of circumcision operations</a> are
            extremely rare. However, they occur.<br />
            <br />
             <span class="yellow">A month-old boy, the son of the
            Imam of Moscow&rsquo;s Historical Mosque, Ramil
            Sadekov, died as a result of the same operation last
            year.</span> The boy&rsquo;s father saw an ad offering
            circumcision operation services in the street not far
            from the mosque. The man called the number indicated in
            the advertisement and invited a &lsquo;doctor&rsquo; to
            perform the traditional ritual on his month-old boy
            named as Salikh.<br />
            <br />
             The &lsquo;doctor&rsquo; came to the imam&rsquo;s
            apartment, conducted the procedure and left. It seemed
            that the operation had been performed successfully,
            without any complications. However, the boy&rsquo;s
            condition started to worsen speedily soon afterwards.
            The baby was dying for several hours.<br />
            <br />
             &ldquo;We were cradling the boy throughout the night.
            At about 5 o&rsquo;clock in the morning we noticed that
            the baby started breathing slower than usual. His
            fingers got cold and turned green,&rdquo; the parents
            told the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.<br />
            <br />
             The baby died of blood loss before the ambulance
            arrived.<br />
            <br />
             Another similar incident took place in Egypt. A
            12-year-old girl died as a result of the circumcision
            operation, which usually stipulates the ablation of
            clitoris. The operation was conducted illegally. The
            girl&rsquo;s mother paid the surgeon $9 for the
            operation. The girl died over anesthesia
            overdose.<br />
            <br />
             Circumcising cultures may circumcise their males
            either shortly after birth, during childhood, or around
            puberty as part of a rite of passage. Circumcision is
            most prevalent in the Muslim world, parts of South East
            Asia, Africa, the United States, Israel, and South
            Korea. It is commonly practised in the Jewish and
            Islamic faiths.<br />
            <br />
             Under Jewish law circumcision is a mitzva aseh
            ("positive commandment" to perform an act) and is
            obligatory for Jewish-born males, and some Jewish male
            converts. It is only postponed or abrogated in the case
            of threat to the life or health of the child. It is
            usually performed by a mohel on the eighth day after
            birth in a ceremony called a Brit milah (or Bris milah,
            colloquially simply bris), which means "Covenant of
            circumcision" in Hebrew. It is considered of such
            religious importance that the body of an uncircumcised
            Jewish male will sometimes be circumcised before
            burial.<br />
            <br />
             Circumcision is customary among the Coptic, Ethiopian,
            and Eritrean Orthodox Churches, and also some other
            African churches. Some Christian churches in South
            Africa oppose circumcision, viewing it as a pagan
            ritual, while others, including the Nomiya church in
            Kenya, require circumcision for membership. Some
            Christian churches celebrate the Circumcision of
            Christ.<br />
            <br />
             In Islam, circumcision is mentioned in some hadith,
            but not in the Qur'an. Some Fiqh scholars state that
            circumcision is recommended (Sunnah); others that it is
            obligatory. Some have quoted the hadith to argue that
            the requirement of circumcision is based on the
            covenant with Abraham. While endorsing circumcision for
            males, scholars note that it is not a requirement for
            converting to Islam.<br />
            <br />
             <a href="/library/cultural/kim1/"
            target="_blank">Circumcision in South Korea</a> is
            largely the result of American cultural and military
            influence following the Korean War. In West Africa
            infant circumcision may have had tribal significance as
            a rite of passage or otherwise in the past; today in
            some non-Muslim Nigerian societies it is medicalised
            and is simply a cultural norm.</p>
