      <h2>New ruling is sought on circumcision</h2>
      BY JOE TYRRELL<br />
      STAFF WRITER 

      <p>A mother will ask a Superior Court judge this morning to
      prevent her estranged husband from interfering with the
      circumcision of their 3-year-old son, but the father said he
      is already winning in the court of public opinion.</p>

      <p>In the wake of the medical dispute, Jennifer Price of
      Clinton also will ask Judge Paul Armstrong for sole custody
      of her son, Matthew, according to her lawyer, Ronald
      Heymann.</p>

      <p>But fresh from a taping of "The Montel Williams Show," the
      father, James Price of Raritan, said, "No judge in the world
      is going to give her sole custody to cut."</p>

      <p>In a groundbreaking case for New Jersey, Armstrong ruled
      in August the procedure could go ahead based on medical
      advice that it would eliminate periodic pain the child
      suffers from inflammation.</p>

      <p>But on Wednesday, urologist Joseph Barone postponed the
      scheduled surgery at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital
      in New Brunswick after hearing from the boy's father, Heymann
      said.</p>

      <p>"We intend to bring to the court's attention that the
      circumcision had to be called off," Heymann said. "Dr. Barone
      said Mr. Price had contacted his office and threatened to
      sue."</p>

      <p>A hospital spokesman confirmed the procedure had been
      called off, but declined to discuss details, citing patient
      confidentiality.</p>

      <p>Price said he did not speak to Barone, merely faxed a
      letter saying he had not granted his consent to the
      circumcision. If the procedure went ahead, it stated he would
      seek "civil and criminal" penalties, and also urge his son to
      sue, he said.</p>

      <p>"To me, that's not making threats, it's putting him on
      notice," he said.</p>

      <p>Price said he hopes to overturn the circumcision ruling
      based on evidence Matthew "didn't suffer the first infection"
      that led Armstrong to permit the circumcision.</p>

      <p>Since the dispute became public last week, "You have no
      idea the amount of people coming forward to help me protect
      my son," he said.</p>

      <p>Heymann said he has no doubt the father has rallied
      support, because "I'm getting e-mails from 8 million
      circumcision groups" opposing the judge's ruling. "It's
      bizarro world," he said.</p>

      <p>According to medical papers, Matthew developed a painful
      condition in March that caused him to scream when he
      urinated. His doctor determined the cause was a severe
      infection of the penis, usually caused by irritants in soaps
      and the foreskin being retracted.</p>

      <p>Barone, a pediatric urologist, agreed with the
      recommendation of Grace Calimlim of PediaHealth Medical
      Associates that circumcision would help.</p>

      <p>Another urologist, Marc Colton, testified the procedure
      was not medically necessary, but did not refute that
      circumcision could alleviate the problem, Armstrong said in
      his ruling.</p>

      <p>But Price said the inflammation cleared up after changes
      in how Matthew was cleaned, indicating it was due to the
      irritants rather than a recurring infection.</p>
