            <h2>Saying no to circumcision</h2>

            <h4>A FEW JEWS ARE BREAKING WITH TRADITION AND HAVING
            ALTERNATIVE BIRTH RITES INSTEAD</h4>

            <h4>By Lisa Fernandez<br />
             Mercury News</h4>

            <p>A small but increasingly active number of Jews are
            bucking ancient tradition, opting not to circumcise
            their sons, a religious rite practiced since Abraham
            first took a flintstone to his foreskin.</p>

            <p>Instead, these families are performing alternative
            birth ceremonies that leave the penis intact. As they
            choose to reject an integral part of their religious
            history, they also risk tearing apart family and
            friends.</p>

            <p>The global movement, powered by the Internet,
            reflects an increase in interfaith marriages, changing
            parenting philosophies and a desire to avoid
            unnecessary surgery. The heart of the country's
            trend-setting "no circ" base is in the Bay Area.</p>

            <p>"I know circumcision is historic, tribal and runs
            really deep, but I don't think it's right," says Avi
            Rose, 49, of Oakland, who did not circumcise his
            adopted son, Oren. "It's precisely because I'm so
            committed to Judaism that I couldn't do what feels
            deeply wrong. A core ritual to welcome a newborn into
            the Jewish world shouldn't do unnecessary
            violence."</p>

            <p>Instead of snipping Oren's foreskin, his parents
            created their own birth ritual, blessing the baby and
            dipping his feet in water, a biblical practice symbolic
            of generosity and hospitality.</p>

            <p>No one keeps an official tally of how many parents
            opt not to circumcise their sons. But Jewish community
            members say anecdotally, the numbers of alternative
            ceremonies, and books and Web sites denouncing
            circumcision are increasing and gaining popularity.
            Helen Bryce, who runs the <a
            href="http://www.fathermag.com/health/circ/bris/"
            target="_blank">Alternative Bris Support Group</a> in
            Capitola, said that <span class="yellow">a decade ago
            she used to get 10 calls a year from Jews questioning
            circumcision; today, that number is 100.</span></p>

            <p>A Jewish circumcision is called a brit milah, or
            bris, and is performed in a few seconds by a mohel,
            sometimes without anesthesia, sometimes with a little
            wine rubbed on the baby's lips. It is often performed
            in a home. It's estimated that at least 90 percent of
            Jewish boys are circumcised in the United States,
            several rabbis and mohels said.</p>

            <p><b>Abraham's pact</b></p>

            <p>As the Genesis story goes, Abraham made a pact with
            God to be circumcised and follow the Torah. In turn,
            God would make Abraham's nation prosperous. Today,
            Jewish boys are circumcised on the eighth day after
            birth.</p>

            <p>Muslims also circumcise their sons in a less-formal
            ceremony called a khitnah or khitan, often in a
            hospital by a secular doctor. Two Muslim
            anti-circumcision Web sites are <a
            href="http://www.quran.org/khatne.htm"
            target="_blank">www.quran.org/khatne.htm</a> or <a
            href="http://www.free-minds-org/sami.htm"
            target="_blank">www.free-minds-org/sami.htm</a>. In the
            Bay Area, Muslims who choose not to circumcise their
            sons are not as vocal as their Jewish counterparts and
            have no active groups, several community members
            said.</p>

            <p>Within Judaism, the debate surfaces every 30 years
            or so and is steeped with religious and medical
            arguments. Both sides are equally passionate.</p>

            <p>Circumcision is barbaric, reduces sexual pleasure,
            and in rare cases, can lead to death, argue the
            "no-circ" supporters. They point to the American
            Pediatric Academy's latest <a
            href="/library/statements/aap1999/">statement</a> in
            1999, which said there was "insufficient" evidence of
            medical benefits to recommend routine hospital
            circumcisions. Since 1980, hospital circumcisions --
            most of which don't include Jews because they
            circumcise at home -- have hovered around the 60
            percent mark, federal health statistics show.</p>

            <p>But traditional Jews counter that circumcision hurts
            as much as being stuck with a pin and can reduce some
            types of infections. But it's more than just a
            scientific argument, they argue.</p>

            <p>"It would be the loss of one of our oldest
            traditions," said Rabbi Alan Lew of San Francisco's <a
            href="http://www.bethsholomsf.org/"
            target="_blank">Congregation Beth Sholom</a>, a
            Conservative synagogue. "For 3,000 years, this is how
            Jewish males have expressed their covenantal
            relationship with God."</p>

            <p>Rabbi Mark Bloom won't let non-circumcised boys have
            a bar mitzvah at <a href="http://www.tbaoakland.org/"
            target="_blank">Temple Beth Abraham</a> in Oakland.
            While he said staff won't be "fanatical" about
            checking, he acknowledged that the children who have
            their diapers changed at temple preschool would be
            discovered.</p>

            <p>"A bar mitzvah acknowledges that you are taking on
            the Jewish commandments," Bloom said. "To flout this
            is such a violation. I know not everyone keeps kosher,
            which is also a commandment, but this is just more
            important. In the Bay Area, some can't believe the
            stance I take. Outside the Bay Area, people can't even
            believe the question."</p>

            <p>Not all rabbis feel that circumcision defines a
            Jew.</p>

            <p>Rabbi Yeshaia Familant, who is also a marriage and
            family counselor in Menlo Park, performs
            circumcision-free ceremonies, which are often called
            brit bli milah (covenant without circumcision), brit
            shalom (covenant of peace), brit shem (covenant of the
            name) or brit hayim (covenant of life).</p>

            <p>Familant said the Jewish "no circ" movement has
            picked up speed in the last five years. Familant cited
            the increase in interfaith marriages, where one spouse
            often doesn't care about the ancient rite. Also, he
            said people nowadays are skeptical of the need for any
            type of surgery, and parents are increasingly
            interested in democracy within the home and the
            "rights of the child."</p>

            <p>Living among diverse ethnic groups also shapes
            opinions.</p>

            <p>Gillian Flato, 32, of San Jose was raised a
            Conservative Jew on the East Coast who had never
            thought twice about circumcising a son if she had
            one.</p>

            <p>But when she moved to Silicon Valley, a friend from
            India said to her: "Any religion that demands you cut
            off part of your son's penis is not a religion I would
            want to be a part of," Flato recalled.</p>

            <p>In 2000, she launched one of the first, and still
            one of the few, Web sites for Jews who consider
            circumcision a barbaric blood sacrifice. Today her
            site, <a href="http://www.jewsagainstcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">www.jewsagainstcircumcision.org</a> has
            grown to 60 international members who advocate keeping
            the human body intact at birth.</p>

            <p><b>`Trauma' recalled</b></p>

            <p>Another popular Web site is run by <a
            href="http://www.nocirc.org/religion/reiss1.html"
            target="_blank">Mark Reiss</a>, 70, a retired San
            Francisco radiologist who recalled what he called the
            "trauma" of his own circumcision in his mid-60s. His
            site, <a
            href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Jewish-shalom.html"
            target="_blank">www.circumstitions.com/Jewish-shalom.html</a>,
            now offers a list of 25 rabbis and lay ministers
            worldwide who perform ceremonies while keeping the
            foreskins intact. He said he gets two or three e-mails
            a week from families seeking information.</p>

            <p>Some Jews are ashamed to tell others of their
            decision.</p>

            <p>One 30s something couple in the North Bay did not
            circumcise their newborn in April. They asked not to be
            named because their larger circle of relatives -- many
            in the South Bay -- don't know about their decision.
            One set of grandparents is Holocaust survivors, and the
            couple's break with tradition was very painful for
            them, even though the baby will be raised a Jew.</p>

            <p>Not circumcising her 3-month-old son, Naison, was so
            traumatic for Kalanete Baruch's father, that he no
            longer speaks to her.</p>

            <p>"It's a touchy issue for observant Jews," said
            Baruch, 34, of Sebastopol. "My dad hung up on me and
            hasn't spoken to me since."</p>

            <p>The uncut Jewish movement comes on the heels of a
            much larger, secular no-circumcision movement founded
            by Marilyn Milos of San Anselmo. She founded the
            National Organization of Circumcision Information
            Resource Center (<a target="_blank"
            href="http://www.nocirc.org/">NOCIRC</a>) in 1986.
            Since then, dozens of groups have formed to fight what
            they call routine child mutilation. The coalition of
            groups successfully lobbied Medicaid to stop paying for
            routine circumcisions in hospitals in 10 states.</p>

            <p>Sari Singerman, 37, and her husband, Moses Goldberg,
            35, did not circumcise their son, Julian Zion. The
            couple said it's about time Jews against circumcision
            speak out -- even if it means stirring up controversy
            at the Petaluma Hebrew school where Goldberg is
            principal.</p>

            <p>"There might be people in the closet who feel like
            they can't say anything and who fear being
            ostracized," Singerman said. "I want people to raise
            the question, `Why do we Jews do this?'"</p>
