            <p>By Jeff Baird<br />
             <a

            <p>The Forum - 02/15/2003</p>

            <p>A <a href="http://www.ci.fargo.nd.us/visitor.htm"
            target="_blank">Fargo</a> doctor accused in civil court
            of not detailing to parents the risks of their son's
            circumcision was found not negligent Friday night.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.co.cass.nd.us/"
            target="_blank">Cass County</a> jury of six women and
            three men returned their verdict after less than two
            hours of deliberation.</p>

            <p>The case was seen by some as a landmark medical
            issue that could determine what hospitals must disclose
            to parents about infant circumcision.</p>

            <p>The jury's decision came after more than seven hours
            of witness testimony and closing arguments Friday in <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/COURT/DISTRICTS/EC.HTM"
             target="_blank">East Central District</a> Judge <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/Rothe-Seeger.htm"
             target="_blank">Cynthia Rothe-Seeger</a>'s
            courtroom.</p>

            <p>Attorney <a href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a> asked the jury to
            consider what a reasonable parent would want to know
            about circumcision before consenting to the procedure.
            "All risks must be disclosed," he said.</p>

            <p>Not so, defense attorney <a
            href="http://www.vogellaw.com/fsl5cs/XMLAttorneyProfile.asp?guid=I1D0AB9301DD211B28BAB4D00E205CACF&amp;ind_wld_id=1286278"
             target="_blank">Jane Voglewede</a> said during her
            closing argument.</p>

            <p>Then, reading from North Dakota law, she said a
            doctor has no duty to talk about health risks so rare
            they are considered negligible.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.zbaer.com/anita.htm"
            target="_blank">Anita Flatt</a> of <a
            href="http://www.hawley.govoffice.com/"
            target="_blank">Hawley</a>, Minn., sued <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734"
             target="_blank">Dr. Sunita Kantak</a> and <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Hospital</a> in <a
            href="http://www.co.cass.nd.us/" target="_blank">Cass
            County</a> District Court, claiming she and her
            husband, James, weren't told complete and accurate
            information about removing the foreskin from their
            son's penis.</p>

            <p>Flatt says she never received the booklet <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare</a> gives to parents, and
            only talked to Kantak briefly about the pain involved
            before the procedure was performed.</p>

            <p>Had Flatt understood the risks of the procedure -
            which include <a href="/library/death/">death</a> - she
            wouldn't have had it done, Baer said.</p>

            <p>Rothe-Seeger Thursday dismissed MeritCare from the
            lawsuit, saying Baer's witnesses failed to prove the
            hospital was responsible for obtaining informed
            consent.</p>

            <p>Kantak, who said she has no memory of the March 1997
            birth because it was routine, says she did discuss
            appropriate benefits and risks - such as infection and
            bleeding - and that it is documented in MeritCare
            records.</p>

            <p>MeritCare nurses and doctors also testified that
            while they cannot recall Flatt's stay, it's Kantak's
            procedure to give thorough talks about the risks and
            benefits of circumcision.</p>

            <p>Baer, who gave his closing argument in the form of a
            PowerPoint presentation, repeatedly told the jury only
            Flatt can recall the day her son was born and the day
            of his circumcision.</p>

            <p>"Anita lived through those facts," he said.</p>

            <p>Baer said the MeritCare medical records contained
            inaccuracies and nurse and doctor testimony
            inconsistencies.</p>

            <p>"Sometimes witnesses try to help a party," he said.
            "When you evaluate the testimony, think about those
            instances in which they said something under oath that
            was not quite accurate."</p>

            <p>Baer compared circumcision to "the branding of
            cattle" and said if hospitals provided more information
            about the foreskin "there would be a lot less cutting
            of our baby boys at one day of age."</p>

            <p>Voglewede had a much different interpretation.</p>

            <p>"This is not a complicated case," she said.</p>

            <p>It is about a young couple that testified to making
            their decision about circumcision before they came to
            the hospital, Voglewede said.</p>

            <p>She said Flatt acknowledges talking to Kantak before
            the procedure, reading the informed-consent sheet and
            signing the sheet.</p>

            <p>Voglewede said the sheet might not explain the
            procedure but it does confirm the parent wanted the
            doctor to perform the circumcision.</p>

            <p>She said "records are made because people can't
            remember," and the story that they tell is pretty
            straightforward - a circumcision was consented to after
            the risks and benefits were explained.</p>

            <p>Voglewede said Baer's own expert witness testified
            that nothing was wrong with the circumcision performed
            and, after reviewing medical records, said any damages
            would be hard to prove in court.</p>

            <p>"Think about how hard he must have looked," she
            said.</p>
