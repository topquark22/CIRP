            <h2>Danish couple held for mutilation</h2>

            <p>Sudan, 06/14 - Danish police have arrested a couple
            of Sudanese origin suspected of taking their two young
            daughters to Sudan to be circumcised.<br />
            <br />
             Female circumcision usually involves the partial
            removal of the woman`s genitals.<br />
            <br />
             It is outlawed in Denmark but remains a widespread
            practice in Africa, the Middle East and South East
            Asia.<br />
            <br />
             Police said the girls, now aged nine and 11, were
            circumcised in 2003 during a trip to the east African
            nation.<br />
            <br />
             The 49-year-old husband and his 40-year-old wife were
            arrested after Danish social services alerted police to
            the fact that medical examinations showed the two girls
            had been circumcised.<br />
            <br />
             The couple, who deny all wrong-doing, were also
            accused of having planned to take their third daughter,
            aged five, to Sudan to be circumcised.<br />
            <br />
             A Danish judge remanded them in custody for eight
            days, pending further investigation. If found guilty,
            they could face up to six years in prison.<br />
            <br />
             Female circumcision can cause death through
            haemorrhaging and later complications during
            childbirth. It also carries risks of infection, urinary
            tract problems and mental trauma.<br />
            <br />
             Some 100 to 140 million girls and women around the
            world have undergone genital mutilation, including 6.5
            million in Western countries, according to a study by
            the French National Institute for Demographic Research
            published last year.</p>
