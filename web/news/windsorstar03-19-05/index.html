            <p>For new parents Michael and Susan Levesque,
            Windsor's fixation with circumcising its newborns is
            simply a matter of doing what their ancestors did.</p>

            <p>"We just decided to go with it, based on tradition,"
            said Michael, whose son Owen was born Feb. 1. "I was,
            'So why not?' "</p>

            <p>Just over 50 per cent of the boys born at <a
            href="http://www.wrh.on.ca/webbuild/site/wrh-internet/">
            Windsor Regional Hospital</a> last year were
            circumcised, well above the national average of 13.9
            per cent. The average in Ontario was 16 per cent.</p>

            <p>Dr. Tony Hammer, a Windsor family doctor, said his
            colleagues may be performing the medically unnecessary
            procedure simply to make a buck. Hammer is critical of
            a procedure which is also not recommended by the <a
            href="http://www.cps.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian
            Paediatric Society</a>.</p>

            <p>"There is a financial incentive for physicians, and
            I wonder if they are fully informing their patients of
            a lack of medical need," said Hammer.</p>

            <p>Obstetricians and the hospital split a $200 fee for
            each procedure, which is not covered by <a
            href="http://www.university.ca/eng/canadainfo/healthcare/onthealth.htm"
             target="_blank">OHIP</a>.</p>

            <p>The head of obstetrics at Windsor Regional couldn't
            be reached, but a hospital spokesman said all
            circumcisions are done at parents' request, and
            rejected Hammer's statement.</p>

            <p>"That comment is appalling. In no way do we promote
            it," said David Musyj, vice-president of corporate
            services and medical affairs. "In no way do they do it
            for the money."</p>

            <p>He also said the rate charged in Windsor is equal to
            and in some cases lower than those charged in other
            hospitals. Circumcision is the surgical removal of the
            foreskin of the penis.</p>

            <p>Last year, there were 4,400 births at Windsor
            Regional and nearly 50 per cent were boys. Of those,
            1,080 circumcisions were performed, representing 51 per
            cent, hospital officials said.</p>

            <p>Jewish and Muslim rites dictate it is done on the
            eighth day after birth.</p>

            <p>According to the Montreal-based <a
            href="http://www.courtchallenge.com/"
            target="_blank">Association for Genital Integrity</a>,
            the Canadian average in 2003 was 13.9 per cent, and 16
            per cent in Ontario. Leading the charge was Prince
            Edward Island at 29.5 per cent, the association said,
            citing figures from <a
            href="http://www.statcan.ca/start.html"
            target="_blank">Statistics Canada</a>.</p>

            <p>Musyj said the hospital's share of the more than
            $200,000 charged for circumcisions last year was for
            supplies, attending nurses and other hospital
            costs.</p>

            <p>Hammer said he regularly advises his pregnant
            patients not to have the procedure done, but
            acknowledged some do anyway.</p>

            <p>He and Musyj agreed that Jews and Muslims, for
            example, require the procedure as a matter of religion,
            and others are doing it just because their parents did.
            Muslims represent one of Windsor's fastest growing
            ethnic populations.</p>

            <p>In the case of the Levesques, "We didn't really look
            into the pros and cons," said Michael, although the
            couple feel that personal sanitation is improved with
            circumcised males.</p>

            <p>"I just felt that guys are lazy, so I wouldn't have
            him go through that."</p>

            <p>Kim and Stavros Kourtsidis of Windsor also decided
            to circumcise their son Joshua, who was born March 7,
            because his older brother had undergone the
            procedure.</p>

            <p>"It's cleanliness," Kim said Friday.</p>

            <p>But opponents argue there are more medical
            complications associated with circumcision, than not
            doing it.</p>

            <p>"I don't think physicians are educating patients
            about the lack of medical need for it. In the majority
            of cases it is cosmetic," Hammer said.</p>

            <p>Dr. Danielle Grenier, of the Canadian Paediatric
            Society, said the number of procedures is declining in
            Canada.</p>

            <p>"There is no medical indication to have newborn boys
            circumcised," she said. "There are no advantages to
            doing it. And with any procedure, there's always a
            risk.</p>

            <p>"It's a painful procedure," she added.</p>

            <p>In most cases a local anesthetic is used, and there
            can also be reaction to medications. "You never know
            how much you are cutting or how much you are leaving,"
            she added.</p>

            <p>"Parent pressure, most of the time," is the reason
            it is still being done, she said.</p>

            <p>The risks may be small but they are there, Hammer
            said. "They do exist. When they occur, one can argue
            they were avoidable.</p>

            <p>"Any ethical physician refers to the recommendations
            of the Canadian Paediatric Society," he said.</p>

            <p>Musyj said Windsor's "multicultural" population
            partly accounts for the high local rate, as well as
            local tradition.</p>

            <p>"Windsor being the community it is, I think that has
            a lot to do with it," he said of the tradition of
            circumcising boys. Musyj said most parents know the sex
            of their child well before delivery, and usually have
            enough time to decide on the procedure. It is done
            before the baby goes home.</p>

            <p>Grenier of the pediatric society said a lot of
            information is available on the subject.</p>

            <p>"Heaven knows what has been published over a little
            piece of skin," she said.</p>

            <h4>TO CUT OR NOT TO CUT</h4>

            <p>According to the Canadian Paediatric Society, of
            every 1,000 boys who are circumcised:</p>

            <ul class="bulletlist">
              <li>20 to 30 will have a surgical complication, such
              as too much bleeding or infection in the area.</li>

              <li>Two to three will have a more serious
              complication that needs more treatment. Examples
              include having too much skin removed or more serious
              bleeding.</li>

              <li>Two will be admitted to hospital for a urinary
              tract infection before they are one year old.</li>

              <li>10 babies may need to have the circumcision done
              again because of a poor result.</li>

              <li>Of every 1,000 boys who are not circumcised,
              seven will be admitted to hospital for a urinary
              tract infection before they are one year old.</li>
