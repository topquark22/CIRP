            <h2>Family Is Awarded $850,000 for Circumcision
            Accident</h2>

            <p>Seattle, Nov. 1 (UPI)-- The family of a 3-year-old
            girl who was born a boy has been awarded $850,000 for
            medical malpractice during a circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             The military doctor performing the operation when the
            baby was five months old burned the central area so
            badly during the circumcision, normally a routine
            operation, that specialists eventually advised changing
            the child's sex to female, testimony in the two-day
            trial this week before Judge Walter McGovern of Federal
            District Court revealed.<br />
            <br />
             Judge McGovern, noting that the child had undergone
            eight operations to date and faced several more as she
            matured, expressed concern for the child and her
            parents in awarding damages.<br />
            <br />
             The child received $750,000 of the judgement and the
            parents $100,000. Compensation also was ordered by
            Judge McGovern fo hte child's medical bills, which
            exceed $30,000.</p>
