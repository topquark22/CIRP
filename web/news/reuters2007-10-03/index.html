            <h2>Jewish "intactivists" in U.S. stop
            circumcising</h2>

            <p>By Helen Chernikoff<br />
            <br />
             NEW YORK (Reuters) - In most respects, Michelle
            Chernikoff Anderson is a rabbi's dream congregant. She
            sings in the choir and takes classes at her
            synagogue.<br />
            <br />
             But, like an increasing number of Jews in the United
            States, she has decided not to circumcise her son,
            rejecting the traditional notion that it is a
            Biblically prescribed sign of the Jewish relationship
            with God.<br />
            <br />
             "I see circumcision as a blood ritual that I can let
            go of," said Anderson, who lives in Southern
            California.<br />
            <br />
             Her position is in harmony with a wider decline in
            circumcision in the United States.<br />
            <br />
             About 85 percent of all American boy babies were
            circumcised at its peak in 1965, according to a
            National Opinion Research Center survey.<br />
            <br />
             By 2004, it had fallen to about 57 percent, reflecting
            the increased birth rate among Hispanics, who are less
            likely to circumcise their sons, data from the <a
            href="http://www.cdc.gov" target="_blank">Centers for
            Disease Control and Prevention</a> shows.<br />
            <br />
             "Circumcision's out of the closet. It's not a taboo
            subject anymore. People are talking about it. Parents
            are talking about it," said Dr. Mark Reiss, a
            synagogue-goer in the San Francisco area and executive
            vice president of <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing
            Circumcision</a>.<br />
            <br />
             Among those talking about it is a gaggle of young,
            male, Jewish commentators. This year alone, in books,
            online and in magazines, authors Neal Pollack, Sam
            Apple, Jonathan Safran Foer and Shalom Auslander have
            all fretted about doing to their sons what was done to
            them. The title of Auslander's memoir, scheduled for
            publication in October, is "Foreskin's Lament."<br />
            <br />
             Circumcision is even before the courts. In November,
            the <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/index.htm"
             target="_blank">Oregon Supreme Court</a> will rule on
            whether a convert to Judaism can force his 12-year-old
            son to undergo the procedure.<br />
            <br />
             "INTACTIVIST"<br />
            <br />
             Reiss, who calls himself an "intactivist," maintains a
            roster of 50 officiants who conduct nonsurgical
            alternatives to the bris, traditionally performed on
            the eighth day after a boy's birth. He says he fields
            as many as five queries weekly from conflicted
            parents.<br />
            <br />
             At the <a href="http://www.jewishcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Jewish Circumcision Resource Center</a>
            in Boston, director Ron Goldman maintains a list of 400
            names of Jews who refuse to circumcise their
            sons.<br />
            <br />
             Reiss and Goldman question circumcision's purported
            health benefits, such as lower rates of penile cancer
            and the recent reports that it can halve men's risk of
            HIV infection.<br />
            <br />
             "Circumcision has always been the panacea for the
            disease of the decade," Reiss said, noting that
            non-Jews first adopted it to reduce masturbation,
            thought to cause syphilis.<br />
            <br />
             Also, they think any benefits are outweighed by the
            risks, which include shock from <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/pdf/BCcoroner_2004.pdf"
             target="_blank">blood loss</a>, <a
            href="/library/complications#infection"
            target="_blank">antibiotic-resistant infections</a> and
            even <a href="/library/death/">death</a>.<br />
            <br />
             Such incidents are extremely rare, said Dr. Jack
            Swanson of the <a href="http://www.aap.org"
            target="_blank">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>.
            Between two and six infant boys experience
            complications per thousand circumcisions, but those are
            usually minor bleeding or treatable infections.<br />
            <br />
             Under a trained professional, the <a
            href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,,2015266,00.html"
             target="_blank">risk to the child</a> is
            "infinitesimal," said Conservative Rabbi Joel
            Roth.<br />
            <br />
             "Jews have given their lives for circumcision more
            than for any other (religious obligation) and that's
            why it has become so defining an act of membership,"
            said Roth.<br />
            <br />
             "SQUEAMISH"<br />
            <br />
             Islam has no comparable movement against circumcision,
            said Batool Al-Toma of the <a
            href="http://www.newmuslimsproject.net/"
            target="_blank">New Muslims Project</a>. Most converts
            undergo the procedure, although Islam waives the
            requirement, said University of Colorado religion
            professor Frederick Denny.<br />
            <br />
             Michael Young, a convert to Islam, had his infant son
            circumcised but did not undergo the procedure himself.
            "I'm very squeamish and hate the thought of it," he
            said.<br />
            <br />
             Judaism is divided on the matter of converts. Reform
            Judaism does not require it, Orthodox and Conservative
            movements do.<br />
            <br />
             Circumcision's detractors also claim the procedure
            reduces sexual sensation and endurance.<br />
            <br />
             "I haven't attempted <a
            href="/pages/restore.html">foreskin restoration</a>
            surgery, but I've thought about it," said Matthew
            Taylor, an active Bay Area Jew who resents his own
            circumcision and who preaches on the evils of the
            practice to Jewish friends .<br />
            <br />
             But author Julius Lester, who became a Reform convert
            to Judaism in 1982 and underwent circumcision to feel
            Jewish, said the procedure also boosted his sex
            life.<br />
            <br />
             "Circumcised there are far more subtle sensations, and
            staying power is much, much longer," he said. "From a
            sexual point of view, I wish I'd gotten circumcised
            many years earlier."<br />
            <br />
             Anderson is torn between a desire to protect her son's
            privacy and what she thinks may be a religious duty to
            discuss her decision not to circumcise.<br />
            <br />
             "Hey, it's my son's penis, it's not mine to discuss in
            the same way it's not mine to cut. But at the same
            time, I feel like maybe I have an obligation to
            share."</p>
