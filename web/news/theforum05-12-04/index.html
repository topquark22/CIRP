            <h3>Circumcision case appeal set today heard today by
            N.D. Supreme Court</h3>

            <p><i>By Janell Cole<br />
            The Forum - 05/12/2004</i></p>

            <p>BISMARCK &ndash; The Hawley, Minn., mother who lost
            a lawsuit last year against the doctor who circumcised
            her baby hopes to get a new trial.</p>

            <p>Anita Flatt's attorney, <a
            href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a>, will argue at the <a
            href="" target="_blank">North Dakota Supreme Court</a>
            today that the trial judge wrongly excluded some of her
            experts' proposed testimony and misled the jury when
            giving them instructions.</p>

            <p>Baer argues in his brief that the judicial errors
            made were so numerous that the case should be
            retried.</p>

            <p>"They began pretrial by excluding relevant evidence
            and continued throughout the course of the trial," Baer
            writes in his brief.</p>

            <p>The case is being watched by anti-circumcision
            activists around the country and internationally.</p>

            <p>Flatt alleges she was not fully informed of the
            elective surgery's effects on her son when she gave her
            consent for the operation on her day-old son in
            1997.</p>

            <p>Afterward, when the parents saw what had happened,
            they cried, Baer writes.</p>

            <p>Flatt and her husband, James, sued <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734"
            target="_blank">Dr. Sunita Kantak</a>, <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Medical Center</a> and the
            state of North Dakota.</p>

            <p>Flatt is also a lawyer and was joined in practice
            with Baer before the lawsuit was filed.</p>

            <p>Lawyers for the hospital and doctor said the Flatts
            were well-informed and that the mother chose the
            circumcision after receiving written information and
            being told of the pain medication her son would
            receive. Doctors said the circumcision and recovery
            were normal.</p>

            <p>James Flatt died before the case went to trial.</p>

            <p>After a two-week trial in Cass County <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/COURT/DISTRICTS/EC.HTM"
            target="_blank">District Court</a> in February 2003,
            the jury found the doctor was not negligent. East
            Central District Judge <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/Rothe-Seeger.htm"
            target="_blank">Cynthia Rothe-Seeger</a> dismissed the
            case against the state before the trial and dismissed
            the case against the hospital before the case went to
            the jury.</p>

            <p>Rothe-Seeger later denied Flatt's request for a new
            trial and Flatt then appealed.</p>

            <p>Baer, of Hawley, wanted to have medical experts
            testify about the standards doctors should use in
            getting informed consent from patients.</p>

            <p>He also said the judge abused her discretion and
            ordered Flatt to pay the hospital and doctor's costs of
            the lawsuit.</p>

            <p>The state of North Dakota was sued on constitutional
            grounds because Baer alleges a law banning female
            genital mutilation is unconstitutional by protecting
            girls but not boys.</p>

            <p>Though they were dismissed from the case, the state
            and the hospital are joining the doctor in fighting the
            attempt to get a new trial. State Solicitor General
            Douglas Bahr argues that Flatt had no standing to
            challenge the law's constitutionality.</p>
