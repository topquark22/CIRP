<h2><font face="arial">Mothers 'coerced' by family
doctor</font></h2>

<p><font face="arial"><b>By Nicola Woolcock</b></font></p>

<p><font face="arial"><i>(Filed: 14/08/2001)</i></font></p>

<p><font face="arial">TWO babies suffered botched circumcisions
after their mothers were coerced by their family doctor into
consenting to the operations, the <a
href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/">General Medical Council</a> was told
yesterday.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Neither baby was anaesthetised properly and
one suffered bleeding after he was sent home.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Dr Michael Harbinson paid the surgeon, Mr
Peter Silverstone, who was practised in religious, not medical,
circumcisions, out of his fund-holding budget.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Dr Harbinson, of Rowlands Gill, Tyne and
Wear, and Mr Silverstone, of Newcastle upon Tyne, both deny serious
professional misconduct. Mr Silverstone also denies allegations
that he failed in his treatment of two women on whom he performed
hysterectomies.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">The GMC's <a
href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/probdocs/probdoc_frameset.htm">professional
conduct committee</a> was told that Dr Harbinson gave the mothers
no choice about who would perform the operations which left both
babies screaming uncontrollably.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Miss Zoe Johnson, for the GMC, told the
hearing: "Dr Harbinson presented the case as a fait accompli. He
did not explain the alternative to circumcision."</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">One of the babies had the operation when he
was six months because he had cysts. "As she waited during the
operation she heard her son screaming as if in agony," said Miss
Johnson.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">The mother of the other baby said every time
she took her baby to the surgery <a
href="/library/statements/gmc/">Dr Harbinson would try to persuade
her to have him circumcised</a>. When the child caught a urinary
infection at the age of six months she agreed.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Afterwards the mother found him screaming
uncontrollably and wearing a bandage soaked with blood. The hearing
continues.</font></p>
