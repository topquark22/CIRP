            <h2>Medical center policy affects circumcisions</h2>
            By Desiree Hunter<br />
             Associated Press Writer 

            <p>JACKSON, Miss.&mdash;The number of circumcisions has
            dropped drastically at the <a
            href="http://www.umc.edu/" target="_blank">University
            of Mississippi Medical Center</a> since a new policy of
            charging for the procedure was implemented.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Since July 1, when the policy
            began, just about a fifth of patients are still
            interested in having their children circumcised,</span>
            said Dr. Bryan Cowan, chairman of UMC's obstetric and
            gynecology department.</p>

            <p>For at least the past 20 years, that department has
            picked up the tab for circumcisions by including the
            optional procedure in the general cost associated with
            delivering baby boys.</p>

            <p>But circumcisions have now been made separate, and
            parents have to pay about $220 at the time of delivery
            in order to have it done, Cowan said.</p>

            <p>"Over the years the pediatric groups have come
            together and have made this a completely elective
            procedure," Cowan said.</p>

            <p>"So with no agency willing to pay for this, we
            simply structured a fee system for this and have now
            applied it to the patients," he said.</p>

            <p>The fee for circumcisions has to be paid in full
            before doctors will perform the procedure, Cowan
            said.</p>

            <p>Since circumcision has not yet been proved to be a
            necessary medical procedure with definite benefits,
            most insurance companies don't pay for it.</p>

            <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics said there is
            some scientific evidence showing potential benefits,
            but not enough for the academy to recommend it as a
            routine procedure.</p>

            <p>In its most recent policy statement, the academy
            said an estimated 1.2 million newborn males are
            circumcised in the United States at a cost of between
            $150 and $270 million.</p>

            <p>The 1999 <a
            href="/library/statements/aap1999/">policy</a> states
            that circumcised males have a smaller chance of
            developing urinary tract infection during their first
            year of life, a three times lower chance of developing
            penile cancer and could have a reduced risk for
            developing syphilis and HIV infections.</p>

            <p>But the policy also says that babies who are
            circumcised without pain relief may respond more
            strongly to pain of future immunizations than those who
            are uncircumcised.</p>

            <p>Though rare, minor complications of mild bleeding
            and local infections also have been associated with the
            surgery.</p>
