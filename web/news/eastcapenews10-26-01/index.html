      <h2>Traditional Leaders Vow to Defy Traditional Circumcision
      Act</h2>

      Bisho</p>

      <p>Traditional leaders yesterday (subs: fri) rejected the
      newly passed traditional circumcision act with "contempt" as
      it allowed for the involvement of women in the traditionally
      exclusively male ritual.</p>

      <p>Eastern Cape House of Traditional leaders chairperson
      Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana said traditional leaders were "very
      disappointed" that the bill had been passed as an act by the
      Bisho legislature on Thursday.</p>

      <p>Chief Nonkonyana said he would be the first to defy it in
      December when his son would undergo the traditional rite.</p>

      <p>He said other traditional authorities would also defy
      it.</p>

      <p>"They can put me in jail, I'm not going to compromise on
      that." He said the government followed churches that brought
      about their own version of circumcision which was not related
      to the traditional ritual.</p>

      <p>He said the act had now brought about a third-type of
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>He called it "the department of health circumcision".</p>

      <p>"We cannot allow women, particularly those that are
      breastfeeding to fiddle with our boys genitals."</p>

      <p>"I even doubt if that act is constitutional. It's a load
      of rubbish and we reject it with the contempt it
      deserves."</p>

      <p>He said the act undermined the public's right to preform
      traditional customs.</p>

      <p>"The first time I saw that bill I was so positive, but now
      when I read it, I can't believe my eyes."</p>

      <p>He said he would take the issue up with Premier Makhenkesi
      Stofile, legislature Speaker Mkhangeli Matomela and
      Traditional Affairs Standing Committee chairperson Themba
      Manyosi.</p>

      <p>He said the bill was sent to the house of traditional
      leaders for consideration and they had filed their objections
      to it.</p>

      <p>However, the act was passed this week despite their
      objections.</p>

      <p>They (govt) sent the bill to us for the sake of sending
      it."</p>

      <p>He said the act was now called the Application of Health
      Standards in Traditional Circumcision instead of the
      traditional circumcision act.</p>

      <p>He suggested a national Indaba be held to discuss the
      issues around traditional circumcision.</p>

      <p>Acting Health MEC Max Mamase said Nonkonyana was part of a
      group of "chauvinists" who defied "environmental change".</p>

      <p>Mamase said the discrimination against women was unfair
      and that Nonkonyana's statement had no substance.</p>

      <p>"There are men that were circumcised by female doctors in
      hospitals and they are men amongst us."</p>

      <p>He said the house of traditional leaders was one of the
      stakeholders that were consulted before the bill was
      passed.</p>

      <p>The fact that they had filed objections to it did not mean
      that it would not be passed.</p>

      <p>Mamase said Nonkonyana would not be charged for
      contravening the act if he defied it as it was meant to guide
      those who saw it as helpful.</p>
