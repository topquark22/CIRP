      <h1>Mutilation Medicine?<br />
      Circumcision Symposium Questions an Ancient Practice</h1>

      <p><i>By Ephrat Livni</i></p>

      <p><b>NEW YORK, Dec. 7</b>&mdash;No matter how you cut it,
      circumcision has become a controversial practice.</p>

      <p>Circumcision&mdash;surgical removal of the foreskin that
      covers the head of the penis&mdash;is widely performed in the
      United States for health and religious reasons. Today, about
      65 percent of newborn American boys have their foreskins
      snipped in hospitals and religious ceremonies, down from
      nearly 90 percent a quarter century ago.</p>

      <p>With mounting evidence that the practice may not be
      medically beneficial, more doctors are speaking out against a
      practice they call "barbaric." This week, anti-circumcision
      activists are meeting at the Sixth International Symposium on
      Genital Integrity in Sydney, Australia, to discuss the
      ethical, social and psychological ramifications of this and
      other forms of "sexual mutilation."</p>

      <p>The gathering of politicians, lawyers, sociologists,
      anthropologists, ethicists, psychologists and physicians will
      consider topics such as the history of sexual mutilation in
      religion and medicine, foreskin restoration and counseling
      approaches for acute post-circumcision stress. <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/"
      target="_blank">NOCIRC</a>&mdash;the National Organization of
      Circumcision Information Resource Centers, a San-Anselmo,
      Calif.-based nonprofit circumcision education group
      sponsoring the symposium&mdash;will also be handing out
      awards to people who have campaigned to end genital
      mutilation worldwide.</p>

      <h4>An Ancient Practice</h4>

      <p>Traditionally, Jews and Muslims have circumcised their
      sons as prescribed in the Book of Genesis by God in his
      covenant with Abraham: "Every male among you shall be
      circumcised." The practice gained popularity in America in
      the 19th century among doctors who believed it stopped males
      from masturbating. It became culturally entrenched during
      both World Wars as a way to help maintain soldiers' hygiene,
      as material collects under the foreskin and can cause
      infection.</p>

      <p>Today, widespread circumcision is still performed for
      health concerns. Circumcised boys have a lower risk of
      urinary tract infections and of getting cancer of the
      penis&mdash;a very rare disease&mdash;as well as a slightly
      lower risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases later
      in life.</p>

      <p>But some experts say the main reason the practice persists
      is because circumcised fathers are in denial. Similar to a
      cycle of abuse, says Dr. Ronald Goldman, executive director
      of the <a href="http://circumcision.org/"
      target="_blank">Circumcision Resource Center</a> in Boston
      and author of <i>Circumcision, The Hidden Trauma</i>, many
      men have a "compulsion to repeat the trauma on the next
      generation."</p>

      <p>Goldman believes the pain baby boys feel during this
      procedure is stored in their unconscious throughout their
      lives. Dr. George C. Denniston, president of the
      Seattle-based nonprofit <a
      href="http://faculty.washington.edu/gcd/DOC/"
      target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>, agrees,
      saying that by encoding a boy's pleasure center with violence
      in his first few days, parents are fundamentally changing his
      whole outlook on life.</p>

      <p>Denniston, who admits it took him a long time as a
      physician to come round to this view of circumcision, now
      believes it is a violation of medical ethics&mdash;a needless
      operation performed on an organ that is perfectly fine as it
      is. "I don't discriminate between body parts. I wouldn't cut
      off fingers or toes either."</p>

      <p>Goldman agrees, adding, "No national medical organization
      in the world recommends [circumcision]."</p>

      <h4>Task Force on Circumcision</h4>

      <p>In fact, in 1999 the American Academy of Pediatrics formed
      a <a href="/library/statements/aap1999/">Task Force on
      Circumcision</a>. Reviewing almost 40 years worth of studies,
      the task force concluded: "Circumcision is not essential to a
      child's well-being at birth, even though it does have some
      potential medical benefits. These benefits are not compelling
      enough to warrant the AAP to recommend routine newborn
      circumcision."</p>

      <p>Carole Lannon, an epidimiologist and pediatrician at the
      <a href="http://www.unc.edu/" target="_blank">University of
      North Carolina</a> at Chapel Hill who chaired the AAP
      circumcision Task Force, says she encourages parents to
      discuss the benefits and risks of the operation with a
      pediatrician before making the decision.</p>

      <p>But because there are sensitive cultural and religious
      issues in the circumcision debate, the pediatricians
      organization's policy paper does state: "It is legitimate for
      parents to take into account cultural, religious and ethnic
      traditions, in addition to medical factors, when making this
      choice."</p>

      <p>The American Urological Association and the <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/position/cps.html"
      target="_blank">Canadian Pediatrics Association</a> agree
      with AAP's position.</p>

      <p>Despite the controversy, same doctors say circumcision
      will continue to be widespread and that the decision should
      be made by parents.</p>

      <p>"Very few doctors or medical establishments recommend
      infant circumcision on a routine basis, but at the same time
      they recognize there are benefits and advantages as well as
      disadvantages and risks. Therefore the decision to circumcise
      or not should be left to the parents," says <i>Circumcision
      Online News</i>, a Web site started by doctors and
      researchers concerned about possible misinformation
      disseminated by the blossoming anti-circumcision
      movement.</p>

      <h4>From the Mouths of Men</h4>

      <p>Those traditions are centuries old and many men&mdash;even
      some who do not consider themselves religious&mdash;would
      like to see them preserved.</p>

      <p>Guy Vidra, a 26-year old secular Jewish man living in New
      York, writes in an e-mail to ABCNEWS.COM: "When and if the
      time comes with my child, I will have him circumcised to go
      through the religious rite." He says he has no recollection
      of the ceremony performed on him and has a hard time
      imagining that a young child could feel "violated" by
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>For Catholic-born John McCloskey, circumcision seems
      "mostly harmless" as a religious ritual. "But," says the
      28-year-old Brooklyn resident, "as a medical operation
      performed on millions of American baby boys, it's
      insane."</p>
