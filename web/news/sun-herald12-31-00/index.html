      <h2>Cruel cut leaves injury trail</h2>
      By <b>Chris Erasmus</b>

      <p>Sunday Sun-Herald 31.12.00</p>

      <p><b>Cape Town:</b> Hospital authorities are bracing
      themselves for an influx of young men injured during tribal
      circumcision ceremonies.</p>

      <p>Two men died this week and another was in a serious
      condition after accidently cutting off his own penis during a
      ritual in Willowvale, in South Africa's Eastern Cape
      province.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for Butterworth Hospital, where the
      19-year-old is being treated, said he was making good
      progress but that he had "lost his penis".</p>

      <p>Hospitals throughout the region expect many more people to
      be admitted following the start of the Xhosa tribe's
      circumcision season, which traditionally takes place in
      summer.</p>

      <p>The spokesman said the use of unsterilised knives and
      razor blades led to infections that were often
      life-threatening.</p>

      <p>The circumcisions, which are seen as an integral part of
      the transition from boy to man, follow a rigorous and lenghty
      process of isolation and deprivation.</p>
