            <p>By Poloko Tau<br />
            <br />
             Siyabonga Radebe wanted to become a "real man" but now
            he is dead, allegedly at the hands of the people who
            were supposed to turn him into one.<br />
            <br />
             On Saturday, West Rand police, acting on a tip-off,
            found the bodies of 14-year-old Radebe and 18-year-old
            Sello Ntsie at an initiation site in Zuurbekom, near
            Westonaria. They arrested six men, who where apparently
            instructors.<br />
            <br />
             Radebe's mother Anna on Sunday told how she had tried
            in vain to persuade her son not to go to an initiation
            school, but he would not listen. He was determined to
            go because he didn't want to be teased. But according
            to other initiates their initiation turned into a
            nightmare of beatings and burnings.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            </p>

            <table width="130" border="0" cellspacing="6"
            cellpadding="0" align="left" summary="">
              <tr>
                <td><b>'We were ordered to put blankets over
                them'</b></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>One of them, Lehlohonolo Ramagaga, 14, on Sunday
            night trembled as he described having to sleep in a
            grass hut the size of a dog kennel. Ramagaga was taken
            to hospital on Saturday after his parents saw the
            wounds he had received after being beaten and
            burnt.<br />
            <br />
             But what happened last Wednesday night will forever
            occupy his mind. This was when the six teachers, who
            are now suspects, allegedly killed Radebe and
            Ntsie.<br />
            <br />
             "He (the 19-year-old main suspect) arrived while we
            were sitting by the fire, and without a word he kicked
            a burning tyre onto Siyabonga's legs and ordered him to
            stand up. He then poured some water over his wounds,"
            Ramagaga said.<br />
            <br />
             "He then took a wooden pick handle and hit him hard on
            the head and continued to kick him after he fell
            down."<br />
            <br />
             Ramagaga said they sat helplessly as the beatings
            continued. Ntsie was also hit with a thick wooden
            handle. "The two boys were bleeding and lying
            motionless on the ground. We were ordered to put
            blankets over them.<br />
            <br />
            </p>

            <table width="130" border="0" cellspacing="6"
            cellpadding="0" align="left" summary="">
              <tr>
                <td><b>'I had no choice but to accept that he
                wanted to do it'</b></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>"We tried to wake them up but you could see they
            were not going to make it. Siyabonga whispered a couple
            of things about his grandmother and asked for his
            mother to forgive her. He couldn't move his lips
            anymore and that was when I realised he was
            gone."<br />
            <br />
             Though she was against her son going to the
            circumcision school, Radebe's mother forked out the
            R700 demanded by the teachers "just to make him happy".
            A sheep was also bought and traditional beer made for
            his welcoming ceremony which was supposed to have taken
            place on Sunday.<br />
            <br />
             "I had no choice but to accept that he wanted to do
            it. I had made peace with it and prayed every day that
            he would come home safely," Anna Radebe said.<br />
            <br />
             She waited with other parents for the initiates to
            come back, but only five of the seven arrived. "Their
            faces were covered. So I looked at the feet and
            realised that my son was not there. I have been having
            a bad feeling about it and then asked them to tell me
            the truth," she said.<br />
            <br />
             "My son has been killed by the people that he had
            trusted with his life. They were supposed to teach him,
            but instead they became monsters over these vulnerable
            children. Did they really have to kill him?"<br />
            <br />
             Police Sergeant Solomon Sibiya said a case of murder
            was being investigated and the suspects would appear in
            court soon.<br />
