          <h2>BOY THREATENED WITH DEATH AFTER INVESTIGATION INTO
          CIRCUMCISION CAMPS</h2>

          <h4>Children kidnapped and mutilated</h4>

          <p><b>SIBUSISO BUBESI</b></p>

          <p>A GANG of suspected kidnappers this week threatened to
          kill a teenager who helped lift the lid on forced
          circumcision camps.</p>

          <p>The racket is centred on the Vaal Triangle township of
          Sebokeng. For years, hundreds of boys and girls have been
          kidnapped by young hoods and taken to the camps. The
          victims are held until their parents pay between R350 and
          R500 for their release. Some have died while trying to
          escape.</p>

          <p>The teenage gangs are said to work for a local woman -
          whose name is known to the <i>Sunday Times</i> and the
          police - who is so feared that she can operate with
          impunity.</p>

          <p>This week eight teenage boys threatened another
          teenager with death if this story was published. The
          threat was made in front of our reporter, photographer
          and Patrick Mabija, a member of the local Community
          Policing Forum. One of the eight said: "We don't want you
          to publish this story and the pictures. If you do, [the
          boy] is going to be in trouble. He is going to die."</p>

          <p>The boys are from Fundulwazi High School in Sebokeng.
          Three are known to Mabija as Welcome, Wilson and Ephraim.
          The boy they threatened was so fearful that he refused to
          name them to the <i>Sunday Times</i>. Mabija said after
          the encounter that he was certain the eight boys were
          involved in the kidnappings.</p>

          <p>The threat is the latest in a number of attempts to
          stop this story from appearing. In other moves, a police
          file containing information on the racket went "missing",
          a local principal was threatened, and the parents of a
          girl who was abducted were told to tell the <i>Sunday
          Times</i> to back away from the story.</p>

          <p><span class="yellow">Sebokeng police officer Captain
          Michael Mohlala said as many as 10 teenagers were
          snatched every day and taken to camps near
          Sebokeng.</span></p>

          <p>He said up to 80 abductees could be accommodated in
          the camps. Children - both male and female - were taken
          from the streets at night by thugs in a bakkie.
          Messengers were sent demanding money and food from
          parents in exchange for the children's return.</p>

          <p>Mabija said he understood the kidnappers were paid R50
          for every person they brought to the camps.</p>

          <p>A caretaker at a camp on a farm in Kleigrond visited
          by the <i>Sunday Times</i> yesterday confirmed youths
          were kidnapped and circumcised against their will. She
          said: "I know the people responsible, but I'm afraid to
          mention their names because I may get killed. They have
          guns and sometimes shoot people at random."</p>

          <p>Judas Moletsane, 18, who had already been circumcised,
          was kidnapped and taken to a camp several times but
          managed to escape. However, in December he died in a
          camp. This week, his father, Teboho Moletsane, 69, held
          back tears as he recalled the events. He said he was
          ready to pay a R350 ransom when he was told his son had
          died.</p>

          <p>"I wake up in the middle of the night and feel sad.
          Sometimes, I think of taking the law into my own hands,"
          he said.</p>

          <p>Another victim was Johnny Moloisane, 22, whose body
          was found buried in a shallow grave near the camp between
          Kleigrond and Houtheuwel railway station after he had
          been kidnapped. His body was decomposed and his private
          parts had been cut off.</p>

          <p>His sister, Seipati, said four people had demanded
          R350, a bag of potatoes and a blanket from his family
          three days after his disappearance.</p>
