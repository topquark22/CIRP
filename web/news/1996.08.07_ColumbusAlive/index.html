      <h1>A new covenant</h1>

      <h2>by Brian Lindamood</h2>
    </center>

    <div class="corpus">
      <blockquote>
        "This is my covenant which you shall keep between me and
        you and your children after you; Every male child among you
        shall be circumcised and you shall circumcise the flesh of
        your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant
        between me and you."<br />
         <cite>Genesis 17:10-11</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Ritual circumcision was practiced long before God made His
      covenant with Abraham. In fact, humans adorned their bodies
      in this way before the dawn of recorded history. The surgical
      removal of the foreskin has taken on a new significance this
      century, though. Some would say the act has taken on no
      significance at all.</p>

      <p>Most Americans no longer circumcise their male children as
      an act of faith, though more than half of the boys born in
      this country today are circumcised. In place of religious
      ritual, the reduction of male genitalia is routinely
      conducted for purported health reasons: health care
      professionals claim circumcision prevents infection of the
      penis, venereal disease and penile and cervical cancers. But
      the medical benefits promulgated by modern doctors may be as
      mythological as the spiritual reasons practiced by our
      ancestors. Of course, this can be seen as a modern religion
      of another sort: "We follow what the doctor says and we don't
      question it," said Lyle Short, a Columbus resident who has
      written extensively about circumcision.</p>

      <p>Added psychologist Jim Bigelow, author of the book <i>The
      Joy of Uncircumcising</i>, "All of this hysteria about what's
      going to happen to your child if you let him have a foreskin
      is just that - it's hysteria."</p>

      <p>Bigelow and Short are part of a decades-old movement of
      activists who are seeking to end routine circumcision, or at
      least make parents think twice before consenting to a
      procedure that forever affects their son's sexual anatomy.
      Circumcision is completely unnecessary at best, activists
      argue, and physically and emotionally damaging - even
      life-threatening - at worst. And, to underscore their
      contentions, as the organized movement to end infant
      circumcision grows, more and more adult men are seeking ways
      to restore their circumcised penises to the way God really
      intended.</p>

      <h3>Masturbation frenzy</h3>

      <p>Circumcision in America became routine 100 years ago as
      part of the "masturbation frenzy" of the sexually repressed
      Victorian Age. Medical and social thinkers in the 1870s
      through 1890s were convinced that self-gratification caused a
      variety of physical and mental illnesses, especially
      insanity. "They took from that that the way to stop
      masturbation was to use circumcision, which we know obviously
      doesn't work," Short said.</p>

      <p>"Essentially, it was a method to take away pleasure and it
      does" added Gary Duncan, Cincinnati field organizer for <a
      href="http://www.noharmm.org" target="_blank">NOHARMM</a>,
      the National Organization to Halt the Abuse and Routine
      Mutilation of Males.</p>

      <p>Cutting off babies' foreskins really became popular after
      the 1940s, as the nation's population became more urban and
      more children were born in hospitals. This also followed on
      the heels of mass circumcisions in the military during World
      War II. In the 50 years since, the former religious rite of
      passage became a routine medical procedure; at its peak, more
      than 90 percent of American baby boys were circumcised.</p>

      <p>Julie Ellsworth estimates that nearly 80 percent of boys
      born in Ohio are still circumcised, though the national
      figure is closer to 50 percent. Ellsworth is the northern
      Ohio representative of <a href="http://www.nocirc.org"
      target="_blank">NOCIRC</a>, the National Organization for
      Circumcision Information Resource Centers, an education and
      advocacy group that tries to inform new parents about
      circumcision before they sign a consent form. "No parent
      really understands the risks," she said. "There are so many
      myths around it, it's difficult sometimes to break
      through."</p>

      <p>According to Ellsworth, the <a href="http://www.aap.org"
      target="_blank">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> calculates
      that one in 500 circumcisions will result in possibly
      life-threatening complications, including hemorrhaging or
      infection. Compare this to older men's one in 100,000 chance
      of contracting penile cancer, which circumcision supposedly
      prevents. "Logically, why would you subject your child to
      something that is more likely to cause harm at the beginning
      of his life to prevent something he will probably never get
      anyway," she asked.</p>

      <p>Another myth Ellsworth tries to counteract is that a boy's
      uncircumcised penis is hard to care for or becomes easily
      infected. This is simply untrue, she said. The proper care of
      an intact penis is to simply leave it alone; the constant
      cleaning, probing and poking is more likely to cause
      infection than prevent it. "If you were to do that to little
      girls - or to any other part of our bodies - they would get
      infected too," Ellsworth said.</p>

      <p>Perhaps the biggest myth anti-circumcision advocates must
      overcome is that of social acceptance. Many parents base the
      decision to circumcise their child on peer pressure or
      superficially "fitting in": they want the boy's penis to look
      like his father's, or they don't want the boy to be different
      or laughed at in the locker room. Critics say these are the
      worst justifications for a decision to permanently alter a
      child's sexual anatomy.</p>

      <p>"Parents don't worry if their son has red hair and the
      father has black hair, or if one wears glasses and the other
      doesn't," Ellsworth said. "Why would you care how a penis
      looks? A penis is a penis."</p>

      <p>These arguments are often framed as a human rights issue:
      the circumcision debate boils down to one group of people
      (parents) making life-altering decisions for another group of
      people (babies). The male foreskin is the only body part of a
      child that parents have the legal right to remove when it is
      healthy, Bigelow said.</p>

      <p>"Do parents have the right to surgically alter their
      child's body when the body part in question is healthy and is
      functioning," he asked. "Why should you assume that a natural
      part of the body probably should be cut off? Shouldn't that
      be the right of the individual to decide?"</p>

      <h3>Circumcision and tonsillectomies as quackery</h3>

      <p>None of the activists accused the medical profession of
      being disingenuous in its traditional support for
      circumcision. After all, doctors once really believed that
      masturbation caused insanity. But medical practice has been
      slow to change in light of evolving knowledge on this
      subject. Bigelow draws parallels with another popular
      preventative surgery: the tonsillectomy craze of 40 years
      ago. Children's tonsils were thought to be unnecessary and
      were frequently removed for protection from sore throats, he
      said; but doctors now know that the tonsils are a functioning
      part of the immune system.</p>

      <p>Similarly, conventional wisdom has held that the foreskin
      is useless, a nuisance, even troublesome if it causes
      infection or disease. But like the masturbation craze and the
      tonsillectomy craze before it, the foreskin craze seems not
      to be justified by anatomical facts. "As we're learning what
      the real structure of the foreskin is, medical researchers
      have started to document that this isn't just redundant
      skin," Bigelow said. "It's highly differentiated tissue that
      has more receptor (nerve) endings than the glans itself.
      Foreskin is a very important part of the male sexual
      anatomy."</p>

      <p>The foreskin also protects the glans, or head of the
      penis. Without the covering of the foreskin, the glans
      becomes callous and loses its sensitivity. "These facts are
      disturbing to the medical profession because they've told
      parents for a hundred years that it didn't matter and surely
      their child wouldn't care one way or another," Bigelow
      added.</p>

      <p>Of course, if the myths about foreskin becoming infected
      or causing diseases were true, one would look for such
      problems to be international epidemics. More than 85 percent
      of the men in the world are uncircumcised. "If you believed
      what you were told, you would expect to see large numbers of
      the world's male population having severe difficulties with
      their penises because they were unfortunate enough to be left
      with this troublesome foreskin," Bigelow said.</p>

      <p>Many doctors in this country are rethinking the
      traditional policy about circumcision. A growing activist
      group, <a href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org"
      target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>, even
      contends that routine circumcision violates all seven
      principles of the American Medical Association's Code of
      Ethics in that it does harm to the patient by removing a
      functioning body part. "Routine infant male circumcision is
      not a valid surgical procedure. Doctors' licenses do not
      permit them to cut people unless they are performing surgery,
      nor may they harm their patents (sic)," Dr. George Denniston,
      president of DOC, wrote in a paper titled <a
      href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/DOC/end.html"
       target="_blank"><i>The End of Circumcision in
      America</i></a>. "In order for a doctor who has been a victim
      himself to stop circumcising others he must take a courageous
      step."</p>

      <p>In a 1990 <a href="/library/general/hughes/">article</a>
      for <i>OHIO Medicine</i>, Columbus physician Dr. George
      Hughes reported the results of a survey he conducted to
      determine the sexual sensitivity and compatibility of
      circumcised and uncircumcised men. "Our survey suggests . . .
      that the uncircumcised male has a more favorable sexual
      compatibility in his marriage," Hughes concluded. "It would
      also appear that this information would outweigh all other
      arguments in favor of circumcision."</p>

      <p>Activists do wonder if there is a financial incentive
      behind the continuation of circumcisions. With a price tag of
      $200 to $300 each, circumcisions can be an easy source of
      revenue for doctors and hospitals, critics contend. "It is a
      tremendous money-maker," Bigelow said, calling circumcision a
      $250 million a year industry. "Now that's a lot of
      money."</p>

      <p>According to Duncan, when Britain instituted its national
      health system after World War II, the government stopped
      paying for circumcision; the practice ended in that country
      almost immediately. That same dramatic decrease has been
      observed in the few cases in this country where a health
      insurance company stopped paying for circumcision, he
      said.</p>

      <p>Ellsworth, who reaches parents-to-be by distributing
      information through childbirth education groups, says that
      childbirth groups affiliated with hospitals won't have
      anything to do with NOCIRC. "You have to wonder if it's
      because they have an interest in promoting it," she said.</p>

      <p>Riverside Methodist and Mount Carmel hospitals were
      contacted for comment on circumcision; neither hospital
      returned telephone calls by presstime.</p>

      <h3>The Judaic tradition revisited</h3>

      <p>A growing realization about the effects of circumcision is
      also spreading through the Jewish community - which has
      practiced circumcision as a religious custom for 4,000 years
      - though there is not an organized awareness campaign within
      mainstream Judaism. "Some of the more progressive branches or
      divisions in Judaism have always recognized that this is
      probably something we should not be doing," said Norm Cohen,
      director of <a href="http://www.nocircofmi.org/"
      target="_blank">NOCIRC of Michigan</a>. "But because of the
      long-term tradition of doing it, these progressive movements
      have never officially come out against it."</p>

      <p>Cohen has written an alternative bris ceremony for Jews to
      use as a way of welcoming the boy into the Jewish community
      without a circumcision. "This ceremony holds very closely to
      the traditional ceremony. It's really in spirit of the
      Covenant of Abraham," he said. "We're working within the
      Jewish faith and the concepts of Judaism to try to make it a
      little bit more humane."</p>

      <p>Remaining uncircumcised should not compromise a boy's
      identity as a Jew, Cohen said: circumcision is not uniquely
      Jewish, nor was the custom invented by Jews. While Cohen says
      he can't argue with the faith involved in Jewish
      circumcision, he does object to the misconception that the
      practice is also healthy. "The only reason that a Jew should
      circumcise is for matters of faith. Unfortunately, many Jews
      also think they're getting some kind of medical benefit,
      which they're not," Cohen said. "If a rabbi or a mohel (a
      ritual circumciser) says that this has medical benefits, then
      it's our duty to challenge that."</p>

      <h3>Reclaiming the lost foreskin</h3>

      <p>Coinciding with the movement to end routine infant
      circumcision has been a movement among adult men to reclaim
      their lost foreskin. "There are a lot of dysfunctions that
      come from circumcisions," said Duncan, a psychotherapist who
      is writing a dissertation on men who have tried to restore
      their penises. Duncan said that common sexual problems in
      America, such as premature ejaculation, are almost unheard of
      in countries where circumcision is not practiced.</p>

      <p>There are also more extreme examples of physical problems:
      bent or painful erections due to too-tight circumcisions and
      even botched circumcisions that result in horribly disfigured
      penises.</p>

      <p>Men must also deal with psychological problems related to
      circumcision, such as sexual dysfunction or strained
      relationships with the parents who made the decision in the
      first place. "It does effect your sexually, so you're talking
      about a very important part of your life. When you find out
      that what was done to you was definitely not in your best
      interest, you begin to question the people who are supposed
      to care about you," said Short, whose articles for NOCIRC and
      other groups are based on his own experience. "It's a little
      like somebody saying I don't like your ears and I'm going to
      cut them off. It's not a parental choice issue."</p>

      <p>Bigelow's ground-breaking book is considered the bible of
      penis restoration in the anti-circumcision movement. <i>The
      Joy of Uncircumcising</i> details the methods and techniques
      men can use to reclaim their foreskin. There are several
      complicated surgical techniques that involve a re-
      positioning of the skin along with a skin graft, he said. But
      most men can perform on themselves any of several
      non-surgical techniques to grow new foreskin.</p>

      <p>These methods are based on the principle of tissue
      expansion, the latest practice in plastic surgery. "The skin
      is the one organ of the body that, if you put traction or
      tension on it, it will grow," Bigelow said from his home in
      California. "What you're really doing is fooling your penis
      into believing that it's growing to incredible lengths and
      must produce the extra skin necessary to cover the extra bulk
      of the shaft."</p>

      <p>Men can attain these results by pulling the skin on the
      shaft of the penis forward, stretching the skin out, and
      taping it in place. Several ready-made products are also sold
      to assist in the various steps of this process. After
      applying this pressure consistently over a long period of
      time - as long as three to five years - the penis will
      produce the extra skin necessary to cover the glans. When the
      tape is removed this new skin becomes a new foreskin.</p>

      <p>Like many in the anti-circumcision movement, Aaron Hoffer
      became involved because of a personal experience. Hoffer had
      himself circumcised when he was 25 years old in order to fit
      in and "become one of the guys." Now, in the unique position
      of knowing first-hand both sides of the circumcision debate,
      he is trying to restore his foreskin to its former state and
      reclaim the sexual sensitivity he lost when he was
      circumcised.</p>

      <p>"I was ignorant of what I was getting rid of when I was
      25," Hoffer said.</p>

      <p>In the coming months, Hoffer plans to start a support
      group in Columbus for men who want to restore their penises;
      Columbus currently does not have an anti-circumcision
      advocacy or support group. Those interested in joining the
      support group can call Hoffer at 253-3144. Hoffer said he
      would like to focus on educating men about what was taken
      from them at birth, and help them understand what the
      foreskin does accomplish. "I want to reassure them that
      various methods will restore the penis to various extents and
      that is does make a difference," he said. "I know the
      difference."</p>

      <p>An important aspect of any circumcision support group, and
      one that Hoffer plans to include, is activism against further
      infant circumcision. Trying to assist tomorrow's babies helps
      some deal with the psychological frustration of circumcision.
      Even amid the hopelessness some men feel that an
      unrecoverable part of their sexuality was taken from them at
      birth, there is optimism that the everyday practice some call
      "barbaric mutilation" can be stopped.</p>

      <p>"It's a very complex issue and one that seems so strange
      to argue in the 1990s," Bigelow said. "We've walked on the
      moon and yet we're still performing an act that ancient man
      in caveman days discovered to go along with their other
      bodily decorations. We've wrapped it in a cloak of
      respectability and keep on doing it."</p>
