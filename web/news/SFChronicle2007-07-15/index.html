            <h4>Uncovering the truth about women's pleasure</h4>
            <small><a
            href="mailto:eguthmann@sfchronicle.com">Edward
            Guthmann, Chronicle Staff Writer</a><br />
             Sunday, July 15, 2007</small> 

            <p>In "The Book of the Penis," a frisky almanac of all
            things phallic, author Maggie Paley dedicates a brief
            section to circumcision, foreskins and the effects they
            have on female sexual pleasure. "Foreskins don't matter
            that much to most women," Paley concluded. "When it
            comes to penises, women can get used to almost
            anything."<br />
            <br />
             Paley probably understated the case. Women really do
            care, if you bother to ask, but in most cases their
            experience is limited to circumcised men. Especially if
            they're American and older than 25.<br />
            <br />
             Starting in the postwar years and peaking in the
            1960s, circumcision was de rigueur for American male
            infants. Ninety percent of new parents opted to alter
            the penis, believing it was the hygienic choice. By
            2003, because of changing attitudes and a large influx
            of Asian and Latin American immigrants who
            traditionally do not circumcise, that number dropped to
            55.9 percent.<br />
            <br />
             I wrote about the shift in a June 21 Chronicle
            article, "<a
            href="/news/SFChronicle2007-06-21/">Circumcision losing
            favor with U.S. parents</a>," and the e-mail response
            was huge. Men bemoaned their parents' choice. Women
            advocated for foreskin restoration. Doctors and parents
            disputed the urologist quoted, who denied that
            circumcision is "brutal."<br />
            <br />
             People are vociferous on the foreskin question, none
            more than Kristen O'Hara, the author of "Sex as Nature
            Intended It" (2002), in which she claims women are more
            likely to enjoy intercourse if their male partner is
            uncircumcised.<br />
            <br />
             "On the natural penis," O'Hara writes on her Web site,
            <a href="http://sexasnatureintendedit.com"
            target="_blank">sexasnatureintendedit.com</a>, "the
            soft, flexible foreskin cushions the coronal-ridge hook
            (of the penis head, or glans) and prevents it from
            scraping the vaginal walls, giving only pleasure, not
            soreness. ... The loose, pliable foreskin bunches up on
            the outward stroke <a
            href="/library/general/warren2/">to create a seal that
            holds fluids in. Lubrication stays inside the
            vagina</a>."<br />
            <br />
             For years, O'Hara says, she suffered pain and
            discomfort during sex with her husband. She wondered if
            the problem was hers. The problem, she finally
            concluded, wasn't her own dysfunction -- what
            psychologists used to call "frigidity" -- but "the
            abnormal structure of the circumcised penis."<br />
            <br />
             Like 85 to 90 percent of American men born in the
            1950s, '60s and '70s, O'Hara's husband, Jeffrey, was
            circumcised at birth. Twenty-one years ago, he went
            through a foreskin restoration process and ever since,
            O'Hara said in an e-mail from her home in
            Massachusetts, "sex became a beautiful thing again and
            was no longer painful. That's when I realized that
            millions of women are having abnormal sex because of
            circumcision, and millions of women fake orgasm because
            of it."<br />
            <br />
             For her book, O'Hara surveyed 139 women, drawn through
            classified ads in various publications. By a margin of
            9 to 1, she says, they preferred the natural penis over
            his maligned, circumcised cousin. When the man is cut,
            O'Hara found, women are "almost five times less likely
            to achieve vaginal orgasm."<br />
            <br />
             With her Web site, O'Hara keeps her campaign alive.
            Photographs of "cut" and "uncut" penises are liberally
            used, along with testimony from the women surveyed,
            such as: "I went with one circumcised guy who was into
            long sessions. After a while, I'd start to feel as if
            he were sandpapering me down there."<br />
            <br />
             O'Hara says she never consulted physicians or sex
            therapists in researching her book. "Sexuality has
            been, and continues to be, a relatively taboo topic,
            and the research money is just not out there. So there
            were no so-called experts to refer to. But I think the
            information at the Web site makes sound logical sense
            and is at the cutting edge of this controversial
            topic."<br />
            <br />
             Susie Bright, editor of the annual Best American
            Erotica series, has spent the past 20 years studying,
            writing about and lecturing on sex. If anyone's a sex
            expert, Bright is. And she thinks O'Hara is full of
            hooey.<br />
            <br />
             "Some people make a cause out of their sexual
            preferences, and find an eager audience," Bright said
            by e-mail from her home in Santa Cruz. "You can buy
            books about how black men supposedly have larger or
            more 'magic' penises than white men, too. The myths are
            apparently catnip to many."<br />
            <br />
             In 1988, South African filmmaker Jo Menell ("Mandela")
            was living in the Bay Area when he made "Dick," a short
            documentary about women's thoughts about penises. "The
            thing I remember most clearly," Menell said by e-mail
            from South Africa, "is the women I listened to saying
            that circumcised men were better lovers because they
            lasted longer. Whether circumcised [penises] hurt -- I
            don't recall any women making that point."<br />
            <br />
             Paley is also dubious. "I've never heard this, ever,"
            she said by phone from New York when I mentioned
            O'Hara's claim that uncircumcised penises are more
            pleasurable to women.<br />
            <br />
             When Paley was researching "The Book of the Penis,"
            she says, the cut-vs.-uncut debate "didn't come up all
            that much. There was a young woman who only liked men
            with big penises and also liked them to be uncut
            because she felt a big penis was manly and so was an
            uncut penis. It was unfettered, it was free, it hadn't
            been tamed by the forces of civilization."<br />
            <br />
             Of the circumcised penis, O'Hara writes, "the head
            flares out from the shaft like the hook on a harpoon.
            This hook is overly firm and constantly exposed, and on
            every outward stroke it scrapes vaginal walls, causing
            irritation, redness, discomfort."<br />
            <br />
             Bright, who also hosts a weekly talk show, "In Bed
            With Susie Bright," says the cut-vs.-uncut question
            really clouds the issue of female sexual fulfillment.
            "The big thing that's missing from this discussion,"
            she says, "is women's (clitorises). That's how most
            women get off."<br />
            <br />
             As for O'Hara's "harpoon" statement, she says, "It's
            not 'true,' it's not scientific. Men's (penis) heads
            are not harpoon hooks, circumcised or not."<br />
            <br />
             Bright says she has no problem with people declaring
            their sexual preferences "from the rooftops," but "to
            make it into a biology lesson or draw these conclusions
            that circumcised penises are unsafe and hurtful, is
            completely unsupported. Why can't people just love
            their fetishes for what they are?"<br />
            <br />
             In the gay world, lots of men fetishize uncircumcised
            penises, in the same way that "size queens" exalt large
            penises. <i>Foreskin Quarterly</i> is a magazine
            devoted to the appreciation of uncut men, and in online
            gay sex postings the person seeking contact usually
            states his penis size and cut-or-uncut status.<br />
            <br />
             But according to Bright, women generally don't fixate
            on genitalia as much as men. Carol Leigh, a sex
            historian and prostitute who calls herself Scarlot
            Harlot, is an exception. Raised in Long Island by
            Jewish parents, she says she's always adored
            uncircumcised penises because "they're exotic. It's
            extremely sexy to a nice Jewish girl from the
            suburbs."<br />
            <br />
             When Paley was researching her book and asked about
            fellatio, she says, most women said they preferred
            circumcised. Foreskinned men "are harder to go down
            on," one said, "because they have folds. And you don't
            know what you're going to find there."<br />
            <br />
             A New York yoga instructor, who chose not to give her
            name, agrees: "I can't help but feel that <a
            href="/library/disease/cancer/vanhowe2006/"
            target="_blank">smegma</a> (or other fluids) get
            trapped inside and they are not appealing to me." On a
            purely esthetic scale, she adds, "I much prefer the
            look of a circumcised penis. I can't help but think
            that the uncut looks serpentine -- and I'm afraid of
            snakes."<br />
            <br />
             A mother of two teenage children thinks the
            uncircumcised phallus looks like "an anteater." Kathy
            Brew, a New York filmmaker who was one of the
            interviewers on Menell's movie "Dick," said a number of
            the women she spoke to described it as "an elephant's
            trunk."<br />
            <br />
             Anteater. Serpent. Elephant's trunk.<br />
            <br />
             Can Mr. Johnson get some respect?<br />
            <br />
             "Circumcised is my preference," says Brew. "Maybe it's
            just convention. Maybe familiarity." Indeed,
            circumcision was so widely practiced in the United
            States until the 1980s that most women over 25 have
            little or no experience with uncut men. I spoke with
            one woman, 56, who slept with 110 men in the footloose
            1970s -- she kept a record -- and swears only one of
            her lovers was uncircumcised.<br />
            <br />
             If the reverse were true, and uncut men were the vast
            majority, wouldn't women feel more squeamish about
            knobs than they do about hoods?<br />
            <br />
             Maybe not. "Most women, unfortunately, do not pay a
            lot of attention to a man's penis," Bright says.
            "They've been brought up not to look or dwell on a part
            of the body, or to sexualize one's genitals. If more
            women took an interest in their sexual self-interest,
            we'd see more of this conversation among women."<br />
