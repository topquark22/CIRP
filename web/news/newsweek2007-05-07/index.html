            <p>May 7, 2007 issue - Poor "Misha." Caught in a
            terrible custody war, this 12-year-old boy from
            Washington state has become a cause
            c&eacute;l&egrave;bre for a diverse group of activists.
            Here are the facts, in brief: Misha lives with his
            father, who has sole custody and who recently converted
            to Judaism. The father wants Misha to convert as well,
            and so he wants Misha circumcised. The boy's mother,
            who is Russian Orthodox, is against it. <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>, an
            activist group, started circulating Misha's story
            online, asking for donations for Misha's defense. A
            lower court affirmed the father's right to circumcise
            his son but has allowed the mother to exhaust her legal
            options before he does so; now the mother hopes that
            her case will be taken up by the <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/index.htm"
             target="_blank">Oregon Supreme Court</a>. The boy's
            own desires remain unclear.</p>

            <p>Two weeks ago, Richard Dawkins, the Oxford don,
            noted atheist and author of "The God Delusion," posted
            Misha's story on his Web site. Dawkins was irate,
            calling Misha's father's intentions "religiously
            inspired child abuse." While court documents clearly
            paint a picture of a marriage and divorce so
            acrimonious and bizarre as to strain credulity, the
            questions Misha's case present remain interesting. What
            is the contemporary religious justification for
            circumcision? How do couples deal fairly with religious
            differences in situations of divorce and
            remarriage?</p>

            <p>Jews are generally circumcised as a symbol of
            Abraham's covenant with God. But as circumcision rates
            in America have declined dramatically over the past 40
            years, from 90 percent to about 60 percent by some
            estimates&mdash;and as the debate about the health
            benefits of the practice continues to inflame
            parents-to-be&mdash;a few Jews, especially in affluent,
            assimilated quarters, have begun to wonder if it's
            necessary. DOC posts a list of rabbis nationwide who
            will perform a religious ritual welcoming boys into the
            world without cutting. More to the point, though, is
            how couples work out their religious conflicts in
            divorce agreements. Raoul Felder, the Manhattan divorce
            attorney, says he's seen several custody cases in which
            one parent confesses to having had a baby baptized in
            secret. But "it's a little hard to hide a
            circumcision." Perhaps Misha's parents need to step
            back and consider the case of <a
            href="/news/chicagotribune2006-10-24/"><i>Schmidt v.
            Niznik</i></a>, decided last fall. In that instance, a
            divorced mother wanted to circumcise her 9-year-old son
            over the father's objections. The judge asked her to
            wait until the boy was old enough to decide for
            himself. Misha may well need a lawyer, but what he
            needs more are parents who will cease inflicting pain
            upon him, psychic or otherwise.</p>
