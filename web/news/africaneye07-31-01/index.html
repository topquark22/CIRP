        <p>Circumcision deaths have cast a pall over the winter
        holidays, but in the former KwaNdebele area of Mpumalanga,
        the tradition remains a joyous celebration. Co-operation
        between traditional healers, doctors and parents has
        resulted in every circumcision operation in the region
        being a success.</p>

        <p>About 400 initiates graduated in Vlaklaagte last weekend
        and were addressed by a proud King Mayitjha III of the
        Ndzundza people, at his royal kraal.</p>

        <p>He said the boys' passage into manhood was a success
        because they had properly prepared for the occasion.</p>

        <p>"Parents took their sons to a doctor for a check-up to
        ensure they were fit and healthy, to avoid death and
        complications," he explained.</p>

        <p>He said doctors had been encouraged to perform the
        surgery at the initiation and schools and a clean razor
        blade was used on each boy. The boys spend two months at
        the initiation school.</p>

        <p>The King said if all initiation schools were properly
        run, they would not get such bad publicity.</p>

        <p>He said he planned to call for a meeting of traditional
        leaders nationwide to discuss the issue of circumcision
        schools and restoring their credibility.</p>

        <p>The King told the graduates that they were now young men
        and had to conduct themselves with pride.</p>

        <p>"You should no longer mingle with the youth, but help
        your families and contribute to society," he said. "You
        should also respect your parents. You should be an example
        to others."</p>

        <p>They were told to be role models at school and to be
        serious about their studies. He warned them of the danger
        of HIV/Aids.</p>
