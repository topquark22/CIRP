      <h2>A rite that went wrong</h2>
      <b>In the wake of a recent spate of initiation deaths, Lin
      Sampson tells the story of Nzuzu Mbavane, one boy who didn't
      survive the transition to manhood</b><br />

      <p>Vanessa Weissenstein lives in the leafy suburb of
      Newlands, in Cape Town. She sits on a large white sofa
      sipping a drink. Beside her is a box of tissues. She has
      warned me that there will be tears.</p>

      <p>"You know that feeling when you are riding a bicycle and
      you run into a tree and it hits you just under the nose?
      Everything seems fine and then suddenly the memory of it
      comes back and you want to blub."</p>

      <p>Within this salubrious atmosphere of the southern suburbs
      there lurks another reality. It is a boy on a harsh hillside
      &mdash;a boy who calls for help. But nobody is listening.</p>

      <p>Seventeen years ago, when Weissenstein started her loving
      relationship with a small boy called Nzuzu, then just two
      years old, she could hardly know that it would forever change
      her perception of the country in which she lived and that
      although it would give her a foothold in another culture, she
      would pay dearly for it.</p>
      <img src="13p17-nzu.jpg" alt="Nzuzu Mbavane" align="left" /> 

      <p>She is paging through an album with photographs of a
      sweet-faced boy, still with childishly plump flesh.</p>

      <p>There are pictures of him blowing out candles on a cake,
      dressing up variously in a Robin Hood outfit and in the
      scarlet tunic of a Grenadier Guard. There are photographs of
      him at parties and lying in the sun at a Clifton cottage.</p>

      <p>The story of Nzuzu and Weissenstein started when
      Weissenstein was married to Brian Levinsohn, her first
      husband, who drowned while diving.</p>

      <p>Says Weissenstein: "I had a domestic worker called Lettie,
      and she had a friend called Lizzie Mbavane who had a little
      boy called Nzuzu, who was two when my son Joshua was born.
      Lizzie was a remarkable woman. She had put two older children
      through university. Nzuzu was her laatlammetjie [the baby in
      the family ] ."</p>

      <p>As a result of Mbavane's visits, it was natural that the
      two children would grow up together. "My husband had just
      died, and I didn't want my unhappiness visited upon one
      child. One child can be a very miserable and lonely
      thing."</p>

      <p>From the start, Nzuzu seemed perfectly in tune with
      Weissenstein's life. "From the age of two he was with me all
      the time."</p>

      <p>After Levinsohn's death, she married Wolfgang
      Weissenstein, and life with Nzuzu settled into a routine. He
      would spend weekends with the Weissensteins and the rest of
      the week with his mother.</p>

      <p>"His mother and I were very close, so we would often take
      decisions about his future together," says Weissenstein.</p>

      <p>In those years, Nzuzu became a paid-up member of the
      southern suburbs set. He was a child of the well-heeled
      Newlands and Hiddingh Estate. Boys and girls vied for his
      attention. He was the most wanted guest at children's
      parties.</p>

      <p>However, through Nzuzu's veins coursed the blood of his
      own culture. He never forgot he was a Xhosa.</p>

      <p>Through the ups and downs of a boy living in two worlds ,
      there was one thread that remained constant - the notion of
      circumcision and initiation. The idea appeared to invoke in
      him both a terror of the unknown and the thrill of becoming a
      grown man.</p>

      <p>"Ever since he was able to think for himself," says
      Weissenstein, "he was very keen on being initiated. The
      subject kept coming up. We would drive to the airport and he
      would see the young initiates and say, 'One day I'm going to
      do that.'</p>

      <p>"I never wanted to express my fears because it was very
      much part of his cultural tool kit but secretly I just hoped
      the whole thing would go away."</p>

      <p>According to traditional healer Simpiwe Citshe, initiation
      is a vital part of male development. "In the Xhosa culture,
      if you do not go through initiation and circumcision you
      never leave boyhood. The community in which you live will
      never accept you. The removal of the foreskin marks the
      beginning of manhood."</p>

      <p>When he was in Std 8 at Wynberg Boys High, Nzuzu's mother
      felt that he needed to get in touch with his cultural roots.
      Although he spoke Xhosa, he could not read or write it.</p>

      <p>"It was round this time that we got rumours of rain," says
      Weissenstein.</p>

      <p>Nzuzu was 16 and experiencing the transgressive period of
      puberty. He would go out and play arcade games and come home
      later than promised. His mother felt that he didn't have the
      cultural strength that he needed to face the kind of
      onslaught he was going to get from 20th-century city
      living.</p>

      <p>It was arranged that he would go and live with his
      grandmother in the Ciskei and visit Cape Town for the
      holidays.</p>

      <p>"The last time he went back on the bus, he was mugged. We
      had given him about R600, and he lost the lot."</p>

      <p>For many years, the Weissensteins have taken a summer
      house beside the lagoon in Nature's Valley. It was a summer
      holiday that Nzuzu looked forward to.</p>

      <p>"Late one Saturday night, just before the June holidays,
      he phoned and said he would not be coming. He said, 'I am
      going tomorrow to have my initiation. It will be at 12
      o'clock, and I want you to think about me.'</p>

      <p>"All I could say to him was that we loved him and that he
      was to clear his mind and think positively. I told him that
      if he was feeling bad he must be sure to get help. I told him
      to be careful not to get dehydrated. He said, 'Don't worry,
      Vanessa, I'm not going to die. I'm not going to die.' "</p>

      <p>By the time Sunday came and Weissenstein had heard
      nothing, she felt that everything must be OK. On Monday,
      Mbavane called from the Ciskei to say that her son had died
      of pneumonia, a complication of the circumcision.</p>

      <p>At this point in the story, Weissenstein breaks into sobs,
      her grief compounded by a feeling of exclusion. "Even his own
      mother did not really know what went on in an initiation
      ceremony. It is very much a male thing, something from which
      women are barred."</p>

      <p>Weissenstein knew that Nzuzu was frightened. However,
      according to Zweliya Nyikima, a trained traditional nurse who
      works as a librarian in the Cory Library at Rhodes University
      and recently guided his own son through initiation, deaths
      are unusual, although more are reported nowadays.</p>

      <p>"We encourage that a boy gets a pre-initiation medical
      certificate. For instance, I am seeing a boy through
      initiation now and because he is asthmatic I allow him to
      take fluids which are normally restricted during the course
      of initiation. A nurse has to be there all the time
      monitoring the situation."</p>

      <p>Among westerners, the biological changes of puberty are
      seldom accompanied by rites of passage, but in most other
      societies, biological maturity has to be reinforced by ritual
      to create all-round adult status.</p>

      <p>Initiation does not always include circumcision. But the
      Xhosa regard circumcision as a vital part of adult status.
      The high point of the period is the circumcision, during
      which the candidate is not supposed to show pain but to
      shout: "I am a man."</p>

      <p>Those who leave are thought to be sissies. Citshe endorses
      the idea: "If a boy is taken to hospital during initiation,
      he could be rejected by his community."</p>

      <p>Problems resulting from the surgical technique itself are
      rare. Most complications are caused by bad post-operative
      procedures. Also, the role of the ikhankatha (initiate's
      nurse) is vital. Inexperience and negligence on the part of
      these nurses often result in initiates being rushed to
      hospital.</p>

      <p>Says Weissenstein: "People say to me that I should have
      kicked up more of a fuss but I don't think it is the role of
      the white person in this country to interfere. I think the
      control will come from the mothers. Black women in this
      country have always been very vocal, and believe me they are
      going to take care of their young."</p>

      <p>She adds: "To me it was something rather like the
      aboriginal songlines [the equivalent of road maps in the form
      of verse]. You might read about them but you would never
      fully understand the true implications."</p>

      <p>But perhaps what Weissenstein is also saying is that in a
      world where rites and spirituality are on the decline, these
      ancient customs should be carefully tended. It is important
      for all of us to follow that inner drum that is our cultural
      heritage.</p>

      <p>The whole process of Nzuzu's life and death has served to
      crystallise her idea of how we should live in a country like
      South Africa. "We were born here and live among people from
      so many different cultures and spiritual backgrounds. We
      should accept others' differences, even if we do not fully
      understand them. You don't choose who you are going to love.
      They come to you and each teaches you something."</p>

      <p>Dabbing at her red eyes, she says: " Nzuzu did not need
      me. He truly did not need me. I got just as much out of him
      as he got out of me." She adds: "He would have made a fine
      man."</p>
