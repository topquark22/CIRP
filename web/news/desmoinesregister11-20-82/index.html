      <h1>Grand jury to probe death of baby after circumcision</h1>

      <p>By PETER RACHTER<br />

      <p class="text">A Polk County grand jury will decide if
      anyone is to blame for the bleeding death of a Des Moines
      infant 10 days ago, a city police official said Friday.</p>

      <p class="text">Lt. Ed Harlan said a police investigation
      into the death three-month-old Christopher Dolezal, who died
      after excessive blood loss following a circumcision, showed
      that the child's parents might have used "poor judgment." But
      he said it would be up to grand jurors to decide if criminal
      charges should be filed.</p>

      <p class="text">Family members have declined to comment on
      the baby's death.</p>

      <p class="text">The child was circumcised at the East Des
      Moines Family Health Care Center at 840 E. University Avenue
      on Nov. 8 two days before his death.</p>

      <p class="text">Despite heavy bleeding, the child's parents
      Frank T. and Katherine Dolezal of 2535 Clarkson Ave., did not
      seek hospital treatment until about 1 a.m. Nov. 9. By that
      time the child had gone through more than 20 bloody diapers,
      according to the Polk County medical examiner's office.</p>

      <p class="text">On Friday, a deputy medical examiner said an
      autopsy revealed that the infant had suffered four broken
      ribs and a broken right arm before death. Dr. Emmanuel
      Lacsina said some of the broken bones had healed. Others were
      in various stages of healing, he said.</p>

      <p class="text">Lacsina said he doubted that the injuries
      occurred during the child's premature birth. Family members
      said the baby was not circumcised shortly after birth, as is
      customary, because he was born prematurely.</p>

      <p class="text">Lacsina said he had hoped that microscopic
      examinations of the child's liver would turn up a clue on why
      he bled extensively after what normally is a simple surgical
      procedure. Lacsina said individuals with liver problems
      sometimes have blood-clotting problems, too. But the tests
      revealed no abnormal condition or disease, Lacsina said.</p>

      <p class="text">The infant's aunt, Norma Fitch, told
      reporters that the family understood the child's doctor to
      say there would be bleeding for about 45 hours.</p>

      <p class="text">But Dr. Harold Moessner, who supervises the
      clinic residency program, denied that any physician would
      have made such a statement. Moessner on Friday declined to
      comment further or to reveal the name of the physician who
      performed the circumcision.</p>
