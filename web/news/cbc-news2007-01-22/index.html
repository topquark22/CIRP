            Canada</h2>

            <p>About one in three healthy baby boys is circumcised
            on Prince Edward Island, about double the national
            rate, despite the advice of experts who describe it as
            unnecessary and potentially risky.</p>

            <p>Dr. Peter Anderson, a pediatric urologist at the <a
            href="http://www.iwk.nshealth.ca/index.cfm?objectid=B2B9F409-D291-878D-1A6F8F89710FDC83"
             target="_blank">IWK Health Centre</a> in Halifax said
            the procedure is most often performed because other
            family members are circumcised. Anderson said
            complications from the procedure can be severe.</p>

            <p>"If you can think of a complication it almost
            certainly has happened somewhere in the world," he
            said, "right from the minor thing of a little bit of
            extra bleeding <span class="yellow">to the extreme
            disaster of loss of the penis."</span></p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Nova Scotia's circumcision rate
            is close to the lowest in Canada, just over one per
            cent.</span> Anderson believes that's because the
            procedure is not offered at hospitals.</p>

            <p>On P.E.I., the operation is performed at the <a
            href="http://www.gov.pe.ca/infopei/index.php3?number=1008533&amp;lang=E"
             target="_blank">Queen Elizabeth Hospital</a> in
            Charlottetown. In December some Island doctors tried to
            have circumcision banned there, because it is not
            medically necessary. The issue went to a vote, and the
            procedures will continue.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.ratemds.com/filecache/doctor-ratings.jsp?did=51764"
             target="_blank">Dr. Doug Tweel</a> is one of the few
            Island doctors who perform circumcisions.</p>

            <p>"There are many procedures done in the hospital
            setting that are elective procedures," said Tweel.</p>

            <p>"If you're coming at it from that perspective, I can
            give you a lot of procedures that are not medically
            necessary."</p>

            <p>The procedure is not covered by medicare. P.E.I.
            doctors charge about $50 dollars. In Nova Scotia the
            charge is close to $300.</p>
