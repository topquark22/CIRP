            <h1>Blitz on initiation schools</h1>
            <b>By Ncedo Kumbaca and Thozi ka Manyisana</b> 

            <h4>UMTATA -- A fleet of 25 vehicles is to be delivered
            today to Eastern Cape health officials and traditional
            leaders -- and their first task will be to drive to the
            Libode area to close down six initiation schools.</h4>

            <p>The fleet is being hired for a month by the <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/structure/department/health2/overview.htm"
             target="_blank">Department of Health</a> at a cost of
            R260000.</p>

            <p>The vehicles will be used by the department and
            traditional leaders in a campaign to crack down on
            initiation schools which are operating illegally and
            causing death and injury to initiates.</p>

            <p><a href="/news/thedailydispatch12-19-02/">At least
            45 initiates have died this year</a>, 12 of them during
            the current December initiation season.</p>

            <p>This is the highest annual death toll since the
            department started recording initiate deaths in
            1995.</p>

            <p>Department spokesperson Sizwe Khuphelo said they
            were intervening to combat the deaths.</p>

            <p>"This shows our seriousness to save the lives of the
            boys," said Khuphelo.</p>

            <p>The initiation schools targeted for closure today
            are situated in the areas around Libode, Ngqeleni and
            Port St Johns. They were allegedly operated by a bogus
            traditional surgeon known as Dosini Guntu, who is based
            in Umtata.</p>

            <p>Guntu is currently out on R500 bail on charges of
            circumcising boys without a permit.</p>

            <p>It is also alleged that Guntu carried out initiation
            rites under the influence of alcohol.</p>

            <p>Khuphelo said that two of Guntu's initiates had died
            and about 10 of them had been admitted to the Umtata
            General Hospital.</p>

            <p>He said during today's raid more arrests of
            amkhankatha (traditional nurses) are expected.</p>

            <p>So far seven people have been arrested in connection
            with botched circumcisions this season in contravention
            of the Application of Health Standards in Traditional
            Circumcision Act. Six of the seven suspects were
            arrested on Sunday in Ntabethemba.</p>

            <p><span>Three of them, aged between 24 and 55, face
            charges of murder and assaulting a 17-year-old initiate
            from Saaiplaas near Tarkastad.</span></p>

            <p>The other three suspects, including a 65-year-old
            traditional surgeon, face charges of transgressing the
            Act.</p>

            <p>Khuphelo warned that where officials saw "bad
            conditions" or initiation schools operating without
            permits, they would be closed down.</p>

            <p>The Act regulates circumcision and requires that
            traditional surgeons and nurses have permits to operate
            and proof of parental consent.</p>

            <p>"No one is above the law," said Khuphelo.</p>

            <p>"We have zero tolerance in terms of this law.
            Anybody who contravenes it will be prosecuted."</p>

            <p>Khuphelo appealed to all boys intending to attend an
            initiation school to follow the rules and also undergo
            medical tests.He said traditional nurses and surgeons
            should fill forms together with the boy's family before
            carrying out the initiation.</p>

            <p>The forms are available on the provincial government
            website at <a
