            <h2>Circumcision school initiate dies</h2>

            <p>An initiate from Zone 13 circumcision school in
            Mdantsane died inside his hut after suffering from
            septicaemia, a post mortem revealed on Wednesday.<br />
            <br />
             And at least one initiate from a Zone 2 circumcision
            school has been put under close monitoring by the
            Buffalo City Traditional Circumcision Association after
            he developed signs of gangrene.<br />
            <br />
             The initiate who died at the weekend was <b>Sabelo
            Marotya</b>, 17.<br />
            <br />
             His body was taken to the police mortuary where it
            remained until the post mortem was conducted.</p>

                <td><big><b>The department of health is also
                investigating</b></big></td>

            <p>Captain Michelle Matroos said a murder docket had
            been opened, but she could not elaborate until a police
            investigation had been concluded.<br />
            <br />
             The department of health is also investigating the
            incident and will take action if negligence is found on
            the part of the traditional nurse in charge of looking
            after the youth.<br />
            <br />
             In terms of the Traditional Circumcision Act of 2001,
            the traditional nurse is required to report any sign of
            illness of an initiate to a medical officer as soon as
            possible.<br />
            <br />
             Local department spokesperson Monde Matshaya said the
            fact the initiate died of septicaemia was an indication
            that he had been ill, and that the traditional nurse
            did not report the matter to medical officers. -
