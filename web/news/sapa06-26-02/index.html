            <h2>'They wanted us to eat his heart'</h2>

            <p>June 26 2002 at 05:40PM</p>

            <p>A group of boys initiated at Ratanda on the East
            Rand were expecting a fun break when they left for a
            traditional Sotho initiation school. It turned out to
            be a nightmare.</p>

            <p>"Our friends told us it's nice there and that you
            play soccer," Leonard Mkhwanazi, 15, said at Heidelberg
            hospital on Wednesday where he is being treated for a
            botched circumcision.</p>

            <p>A fellow initiate, Sipho Mhkwanazi, 17, said: "I
            feel so bad because one of my dreams died. Eight people
            took turns in hitting him (one of the dead initiates)
            50 times each. The other boys beat him as well."</p>

            <p>The group of boys spoke to Sapa on Wednesday after
            being discharged from hospital. They were among the
            more than 50 initiates saved by the police after <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/sapa06-25-02/">five died
            during a traditional ceremony</a> this week.</p>

            <p>'I feel so bad because one of my dreams died'</p>

            <p>Johannes Makhoba, 15, said if the police had not
            arrived the initiates would have been forced to eat the
            dead teen's heart.</p>

            <p>"They wanted us to eat his heart because he ran away
            but then one teacher informed the police that a boy had
            died."</p>

            <p>Asked whether the boys did not consider running
            away, he said :"If we tried to get out, they would have
            killed us."</p>

            <p>Makhoba said the teachers told them to tell their
            friends after the seven weeks of initiation that it was
            pleasant at the camp.</p>

            <p>"But when you go there everything changes. You don't
            see the things that you expected to see."</p>

            <p><b><span>'They wanted us to eat his heart because he
            ran away'</span></b></p>

            <p>East Rand police spokesperson Anneline Prinsloo said
            the results of the post-mortems of the five boys had
            implicated teachers from the initiation schools in
            their deaths.</p>

            <p>The five teachers had been arrested and would be
            charged in the Heidelberg Magistrate's Court on
            Thursday.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.sahrc.org.za/"
            target="_blank">SA Human Rights Commission</a> (SAHRC)
            welcomed the arrests and called on traditional leaders,
            healers and the government to organise an indaba at
            which a legal framework should be developed to monitor
            the tradition which symbolically turns boys into
            men.</p>

            <p>The organisation said the ceremonies breached the
            rights to human dignity, life, freedom and security of
            the person, freedom of movement and residence, health
            care, food, water, social security, and education.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.da.org.za/DA/Site/Eng/DEFAULT.htm"
            target="_blank">The Democratic Alliance</a> said it was
            appalled by the latest deaths resulting from botched
            circumcisions. "This is a purely criminal matter and
            charges should be laid against those who so
            opportunistically pervert traditional customs into
            cruelty to others," a DA statement said.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.natweb.co.za/"
            target="_blank">New National Party</a> also called for
            legislation to monitor the functioning of initiation
            schools.</p>

            <p>"It is very important to use the right technique and
            adequate hygiene otherwise the boys will die of
            excessive bleeding, infection or will even be infected
            by the HI virus," the NNP said.</p>

            <p>The first boy was found in the mountainous Ratanda
            area on Monday evening. He died on his way to hospital.
            On Tuesday morning, local residents informed the police
            about four more bodies in the area.</p>

            <p>A police helicopter collected the bodies and it was
            established that more boys who participated in the
            ceremony had gone missing. They later found about 50
            boys hiding in the area.</p>

            <p>The group of Sotho boys were from Orange Farm, near
            Vereeniging, and had been in Ratanda since the
            beginning of June. - Sapa</p>
