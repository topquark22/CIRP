    in a quest to bring foreskins to the fore.<br />

    <p>Paul Russo is feeling like his old self again. Sure, it took
    a year's worth of pulling, yanking, stretching, a few rolls of
    surgical tape and the help of assorted homemade contraptions,
    but he finally did it. The once-circumcised Russo has regrown
    his foreskin.</p>

    <p>Don't believe it? Just look at his home page on the Web.
    Russo, who provides online technical support for a small
    Boulder software firm, has documented the enhancement of his
    penile profile during the past year in a series of
    black-and-white photographs and posted them on the Internet for
    all to see. The results have even impressed one prominent
    Denver urologist.</p>

    <p>But now that he's done it, the question is why? Russo is
    part of a growing contingent of foreskin advocates who are
    using the Internet not only to spread their anti-circumcision
    message but to demonstrate that even long after that little
    piece of seemingly insignificant skin is tossed into the
    hospital's medical-waste incinerator, all is not lost.</p>

    <p>"I'm doing this because it was something I had, something I
    was entitled to and that was taken away from me," says the
    31-year-old Boulderite. "When I found out that there was
    something I could do about it, I had to try. It was robbed from
    me. I just wanted it back."</p>

    <p>The Web site that Russo created includes pictures of his
    penis during the last year, information about why he's doing
    this and a diary of his highs and lows. In one emotionally
    charged entry, he writes: "March 8, 1996: When I started to
    pee, I felt something that I had never felt before, something
    intact guys probably feel every day. I felt the warmth of the
    urine fill the space under the skin for an instant...I was
    overwhelmed by a sense of loss."</p>

    <p>Russo's story of loss and regeneration has made him a star
    among online foreskin fans. However, another local Web site,
    Derrick Townsend's Foreskin Restoration Site, a step-by-step
    guide to foreskin regeneration that taught Russo how to
    recapture his full manhood, is one of the most-talked-about Web
    pages on the topic. Townsend (a pseudonym he uses on the site)
    has received hundreds of thousands of hits on his extensive,
    well-organized guide.</p>

    <p>Like most American men, Townsend, 33, was circumcised as a
    newborn. At first his young mother, who'd never seen an uncut
    penis, thought her son was deformed and wanted the situation
    "resolved," he says.</p>

    <p>Townsend, who says he has always been "fascinated" by
    foreskins, first became aware of the idea of restoring his own
    through a local gay and lesbian electronic bulletin board that
    had a discussion area on the topic.</p>

    <p>His initial attempt at foreskin regrowth involved taping
    tiny weights to his penis to lengthen the skin around the glans
    head, a technique culled from the bulletin board. That
    experiment ended shortly after the traumatic experience of
    having the weights slip down his pant leg at work and fall on
    the floor in front of a customer, says Townsend, who now works
    for an Internet development company.</p>

    <p>He later joined an electronic mailing list detailing various
    foreskin-reconstruction methods. That's how he discovered the
    T-tape and Strap method of foreskin extension. Townsend found
    the instructions for this method confusing, so he decided to
    start a site to clarify them.</p>

    <p>The method he illustrates--with the help of an immodest
    cyberpal who donated pictures of his own penis going through
    the rigmarole--is enough to make most men squirm. It involves
    placing a good deal of surgical tape (shaped in the form of a
    T) around the remnants of the foreskin, clipping a suspender to
    the end of the tape and pulling. The suspender is then tightly
    fastened around the waist (or around the neck during bedtime).
    Townsend and Russo, who know each other only through e-mail,
    have both used this method to regrow their foreskin.</p>

    <p>For the system to work, the tension must be nearly
    continual. Russo has worn his T-tape and strap for as long as
    23 hours a day for more than a year and is not finished yet.
    The tape is a hassle, says Russo, but he's become adept at
    discreetly slipping it off at the gym and working around it in
    the men's room. "I sit down a lot," he explains.</p>

    <p>The tension encourages new skin cells to grow and lengthens
    the skin around the penis. The idea of "stretching" the skin is
    based on methods doctors use to generate new skin for burn
    victims.</p>

    <p>The new skin is not a foreskin, per se, since it lacks the
    nerve endings lost during circumcision. However, it does create
    what Russo describes as a "warm little cocoon," allowing the
    penis to hide from the abrasive world of underwear, jock straps
    and bedsheets.</p>

    <p>The photo diary of Russo's progress makes a compelling
    argument that foreskin regeneration is "not just witchcraft or
    smoke and mirrors," says Townsend.</p>

    <p>Dr. Martin Koyle, professor of surgery and urology at the
    University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and chief of
    pediatric urology at Children's Hospital, calls Russo's and
    Townsend's home pages "amazing." Koyle, who performs routine
    circumcision on newborns, does not advocate its practice as a
    medical necessity. He receives about three calls a year from
    men who are interested in restoring their foreskins through
    surgery, says Koyle, but surgical methods of foreskin
    reconstruction have been almost entirely unsuccessful. The
    benefits that Townsend and Russo tout are likely attributable
    to the psychology of sex rather than the physiology of the
    penis, Koyle says, but he adds that they are benefits
    nonetheless.</p>

    <p>For his part, Russo says he's already realized those
    benefits. "I don't feel like the same person," he says. "It's
    so sensitive. I always thought I was enjoying sex as much as
    anyone could enjoy sex, but of course, I had nothing to compare
    it to."</p>

    <p>Russo, however, says he still feels a sense of loss because
    the nerve endings are irrevocably gone. "It may look like a
    foreskin and act like a foreskin," he says, "but it doesn't
    feel like one."</p>

    <p>Townsend says the value for him is mainly cosmetic, though
    he says there has been physical improvement as well.</p>

    <p>Many people probably think Russo and Townsend are making a
    big flap over practically nothing. Forget the fact that,
    according to quite a few people, the foreskin enhances penile
    sensitivity. To most, the foreskin is viewed as an affront to
    nature itself, perhaps akin to hair in a woman's armpit.
    Indeed, the presence of a foreskin can be blamed for many a
    high school locker-room pummeling.</p>

    <p>Routine male circumcision in America began in the 1870s as
    an attempted cure for masturbation, which at the time was
    believed to be the cause of many maladies, according to John
    Bigelow, author of <i>The Joy of Uncircumcising</i>, a seminal
    work in foreskin restoration. Traveling medicine shows would
    often offer men a quick clip to go with their patented
    "cure-all" tonics. By the late 1920s, the excuse of preventive
    medicine had caught on. By then, the medical establishment had
    rejected the idea that masturbation caused disease, but Bigelow
    says the foreskin remained "villainized." Circumcision, doctors
    believed, could prevent everything from venereal disease to
    penile cancer.</p>

    <p>By 1940, American doctors regularly circumcised newborn
    males. Today the United States remains the only country in
    which most doctors routinely circumcise for non-religious
    reasons. It's estimated that 75 percent of American males are
    circumcised shortly after birth. Nations such as Canada,
    Germany, France and England have newborn-circumcision rates of
    about 5 percent, according to Koyle.</p>

    <p>Studies in the Eighties demonstrated that 95 percent of
    bladder and kidney infections among infants were found in
    uncircumcised males, lending weight to the belief that
    circumcision was beneficial. However, doctors like Koyle are
    skeptical. "The question becomes: Do you circumcise 500 boys to
    prevent one infection?" he says. "To me, that's overkill."</p>

    <p>Koyle points out that circumcision is far from risk-free.
    One in 5,000 babies suffers acute complications from the
    procedure, he says, and treatment for these complications are
    more dangerous than the treatment for infections that often
    accompany foreskin. One of the most horrifying cases of a
    complication occurred in the late Eighties when a Georgia boy's
    circumcision was so badly botched that the parents and doctor
    agreed to perform a sex change on the six-month-old.</p>

    <p>Still, the idea that if it was good enough for dad, it's
    good enough for junior keeps circumcision alive. People like
    Bigelow, Russo and Townsend believe the question about foreskin
    is one of basic human rights. Though none believe that male
    circumcision is as brutal as some forms of female circumcision
    that include removal of the minor labia, all still contend that
    it's genital mutilation.</p>

    <p>"I feel the same about it as if I were an infant and someone
    cut off my hand," says Russo. "That would be child abuse. But
    with circumcision, everyone says that, oh, it's no big deal.
    You're just obsessed with your penis. But to me, it's the same
    issue." <img width="12" height="10" src="nt.gif" /></p>
