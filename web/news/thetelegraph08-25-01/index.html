<p><font face="arial">A SURGEON who left patients in agony after
bungled <a
href="http://www.hysterectomy-association.org.uk/">hysterectomy</a>
and <a href="/library/statements/gmc/">circumcision operations</a>
was struck off the medical register yesterday.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Peter Silverstone, 58, of Elmfield Park,
Newcastle upon Tyne, <a href="/news/thetelegraph08-14-01/">failed
to anaesthetise two baby boys properly before operating on
them</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Two women also suffered severe blood loss
when he left them in the care of nurses after surgery.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">He denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the
women were private patients and subject to different procedures but
he was found guilty of <a
href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/probdocs/probdoc_frameset.htm">serious
professional misconduct</a> by the <a
href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/">General Medical
Council</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Silverstone performed circumcisions on boys
aged six months and seven months at a surgery in Dipton, Tyne and
Wear, in 1998.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Both babies screamed in pain during the
operations and one boy bled for hours after the operation until
Silverstone visited the family home to give him
stitches.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">The two hysterectomies were performed in
Washington, Tyne and Wear. After the first operation in November
1995, Silverstone went home but was called back to the hospital
when the 46-year-old patient suffered internal bleeding.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">However the surgeon got caught in traffic and
his journey lasted over an hour. He asked a medical student to help
with the second operation in 1998 and went on leave the next
day.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Silverstone was found to have abused his
professional position over the circumcisions and to have acted
inappropriately and incompetently. His treatment of both women was
ruled inadequate and irresponsible.</font></p>
