            <h2>Making the Cut</h2>

            <p><b>By JENINNE LEE-ST. JOHN</b></p>

            <p>Expectant parents have loads of decisions to make,
            from whether to find out the baby's gender beforehand
            to planning the birth. But recently some have taken up
            another debate, over a cut that used to be nearly as
            routine in the U.S. as that of the umbilical cord:
            circumcision. When Jessica Davis learned she was having
            a boy, she and her husband assumed that the baby's
            foreskin would be removed. But when asked why by her
            obstetrician, who is originally from South Africa,
            where circumcision is rare, Davis, 28, a college
            administrator, did research and decided that the risks
            trumped the benefits. She left her son Aiden, now 20
            months, intact--though she says her spouse remains
            leery of the decision: "He's kind of like, 'Well, I
            work just fine.'"<br />
            <br />
             On Davis' side are the small but vocal, and growing,
            forces against circumcision, so-called intactivists:
            young parents who don't want to alter their perfect
            babies, men who feel their circumcisions left them
            psychically scarred and sexually disadvantaged ("I
            always felt something was missing, not functioning
            properly," says David Wilson, whose <a
            href="http://www.stopinfantcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Stop Infant Circumcision Society</a>
            marches on Washington annually) and even some medical
            professionals who consider the procedure genital
            mutilation.<br />
            <br />
             And at least in some parts of the country, opinion is
            shifting in their favor. According to the <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/general/laumann/"
            target="_blank">National Health and Social Life
            Survey</a>, the total proportion of U.S.-born males who
            were circumcised peaked in 1965 at about 85%, dropping
            to 77% in 1971, the last year of the study. The
            National Hospital Discharge Survey, which began
            tallying newborn circumcisions in 1979, shows a
            downward trend, from 65% that year to 57% in 2005. Much
            of the decline is attributed to immigration from Latin
            America and Asia, where the procedure is rare.
            Additionally, in more than a dozen states, Medicaid no
            longer covers the surgery routinely, leaving many poor
            children without the option. But intactivism is also
            gaining traction among educated, middle-class whites.
            As University of Virginia sociologist Brad Wilcox
            observes, "It's these new parents that are unwilling to
            let kids suffer."<br />
            <br />
             But circumcision partisans say a foreskin causes
            suffering too. Intact boys are at greater risk for
            kidney infection as infants, and for penile cancer,
            foreskin disorders, HIV and other STDs like human
            papillomavirus later in life, leaving female partners
            more likely to get cervical cancer. The cost of
            prevention, proponents say, is the brief trauma of the
            procedure. Says Edgar Schoen, former pediatrics chief
            at Kaiser Permanente, who led the 1989 American
            Association of Pediatrics circumcision task force,
            which came out neutral on cutting: "A newborn baby is
            programmed for stress and recovers quickly." Opponents,
            on the other hand, say foreskin-related afflictions are
            rare, condoms block STDs, and circumcision has its
            risks. Michelle Richardson, of Fort Worth, Texas, says
            her 5-year-old has two genital disorders due to his
            botched circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             The debate has even extended to the religious practice
            of Jews. Instead of opting for a bris, the rite in
            which a boy's foreskin is removed at 8 days old, Theo
            Margaritov's family welcomed him in April with a <a
            href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Jewish-shalom.html"
            target="_blank">brit shalom</a>, a cut-free ceremony.
            "That's the way God made him," says his mom Deborah,
            33, a raw-foods cooking teacher in Brooklyn, N.Y.<br />
            <br />
             Still, religion and health aren't the only concerns
            parents weigh when making the decision to cut or not to
            cut; tradition is also a factor. Liz Arnaiz, 30, a
            Brooklyn architect whose son Lucas was circumcised when
            he was born last November, says her husband is
            circumcised, so it made sense for the boy to be like
            his dad. Besides, she adds, "to imagine your kid in the
            locker room the odd man out is tough."</p>
