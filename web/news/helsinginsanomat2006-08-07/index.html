            four-year-old boy illegal</b></span><br />
             Legal status of nonmedical procedure remains murky</p>

            <p>Finland&rsquo;s first court ruling on male child
            circumcision was handed down by a Finnish court on
            Friday. A Muslim mother faced charges of assault in
            Tampere District Court for having her four-year-old son
            circumcised.<br />
             The incident was reported to the police by the
            boy&rsquo;s father, who had not been consulted.<br />
             The court found that the mother&rsquo;s action was
            illegal. However, it did not assign any punishment. The
            mother defended her action by saying that she thought
            that circumcisions performed by doctors were legal in
            Finland.<br />
             The case will now go to the Court of Appeals.</p>

            <p><b>The mother said that the procedure</b> is part of
            the family&rsquo;s religion and cultural heritage. The
            court found that interfering with personal
            inviolability could be allowed only in cases
            specifically permitted by law.<br />
             "There is a perception in Finland that only
            girls&rsquo; circumcisions are banned by law. There is
            no specific legislation about them; both types are
            illegal under the same criminal law. After all, in both
            procedures, part of healthy genitalia is removed
            without medical foundation, or competent consent", says
            local prosecutor Jouko Nurminen .<br />
             Nurminen says that the "misconception" may have arisen
            in connection with the drafting of the new
            constitution, at which time only the circumcision of
            girls was part of the debate.<br />
             <span class="yellow">In its decision, the court notes
            that not even a long religious tradition justifies
            protecting the bodily inviolability of boys to a lesser
            degree than that of girls.</span></p>

            <p><b>A working group</b> of the <a
            href="http://www.stm.fi/Resource.phx/eng/index.htx"
            target="_blank">Ministry of Social Affairs and
            Health</a> proposed a few years ago that circumcisions
            performed under medical supervision in hospitals should
            be allowed.<br />
             The working group wanted to avoid complications from
            operations performed at home, and to reduce the
            suffering of the child.</p>

            <p><b>Legislation is somewhat vague</b> on the matter,
            and practice varies in Finland. For instance, a report
            drafted by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health in
            2004 notes that male circumcision is permitted in all
            countries.<br />
             "There is no legislation on male circumcision, but
            there is also no prohibition. The operations have been
            performed on the basis of common law", says
            Riitta-Maija Jouttim&auml;ki, a lawyer for the Ministry
            of Social Affairs and Health.</p>
