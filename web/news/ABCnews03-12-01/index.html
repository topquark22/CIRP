    <blockquote>
      <font size="5"><b>Suing Over Circumcision<br />
       Man Says Lack Of Foreskin Hurts Sex Life</b></font> 

      <p><img src="stowel.jpg" alt="William Stowell"
      align="right" /> <b>March 12 &mdash;</b> Given the choice,
      William Stowell says he would have kept his foreskin. Since
      the choice was made for him, he's suing the hospital where he
      was born and circumcised for depriving him of "the pleasure
      of natural, normal sexual intercourse."</p>

      <p>Stowell says his sex life would be much better if he had
      been allowed to keep his foreskin &mdash; the loose fold of
      skin that covers the glans of the penis. But his mother
      denied that to him when she signed a circumcision consent
      form in the maternity ward where she gave birth; she says now
      that was a mistake.</p>

      <p>Stowell's attorney in the case, <a
      href="http://firms.findlaw.com//llewellynlaw/practices.htm"
      target="_blank">David Llewellyn</a>, has some experience with
      men who miss their foreskins. In fact, he has filed similar
      lawsuits in the past, winning as much as $65,000 in one
      settlement.</p>

      <p><b>A Mother's Mistake</b></p>

      <p>In this case, Llewellyn will argue that Stowell's mother
      was under the influence of post-Caesarian painkillers when
      she agreed to the 10-minute surgical procedure at <a
      href="http://www.webspan.net/~goodsam/GoodSamHosp.html"
      target="_blank">Good Samaritan Hospital</a> in West Islip,
      N.Y.</p>

      <p>Sixty percent of men in the U.S. have been circumcised.
      Stowell has focused on studies that favor foreskins and he
      says that he knows he and his partners would be enjoying sex
      more if he still had his.</p>

      <p>A 1999 study published in the <i>British Journal of
      Urology</i> involved 139 women who offered answers about sex
      with men with and without foreskins. In the end, the results
      showed more than half the women who filled out the surveys
      felt that sex with uncircumcised men was more enjoyable
      because they experienced more pleasure and less
      discomfort.</p>

      <p>The <a href="/library/anatomy/ohara/">study</a>, conducted
      by Kristen O' Hare [sic] concludes "the anatomically complete penis
      offers a more rewarding experience for the female partner
      during coitus." However, O'Hare even acknowledges the study's
      shortcomings: The respondents were not selected randomly and
      several were recruited using a newsletter put out by an
      anti-circumcision organization.</p>

      <p><b>Circumcision Cases</b></p>

      <p>Stowell's is the 21st case Llewellyn has filed involving
      circumcision. About half were similar to this one with adults
      suing, claiming the surgery was done without proper
      consent.</p>

      <p>Another case involved an adult who went in for surgery to
      have his bent penis straightened, and awoke to find his
      foreskin gone as well. The others involve surgeries that were
      botched one way or another.</p>

      <p>Stowell's suit was filed in December and the hospital
      responded with a motion to dismiss. In it the hospital claims
      there is a 10-year statute of limitations on medical
      malpractice suits. However, Llewellyn responds that in the
      state of New York, the clock doesn't start ticking until a
      person turns 18.</p>

      <p>The outcome of this case could take awhile. The briefs are
      due by the end of the month but the judge can take as long as
      he wants to decide what to do.</p>

      <p><b>Routine Procedure</b></p>

      <p>Two years ago, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued
      new <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">recommendations</a> on
      circumcisions as routine procedures. After nearly 40 years of
      analysis on the topic it found that the benefits were not
      significant enough to warrant the AAP to recommend routine
      newborn circumcision. Dr. Carole Lannon, the head of AAP's
      Task Force on Circumcision, encouraged parents to make an
      informed decision about what is in the best interest of their
      child.</p>

      <p>In a 1989 <a target="_blank"
      href="http://faculty.washington.edu/gcd/DOC/spock.html">interview</a>
      with <i>Redbook</i> magazine, Dr. Benjamin Spock, author of
      <i>Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care</i> and one of the world's
      most famous pediatricians, weighed in on the subject.</p>

      <p>When asked about circumcision he said quite simply, "My
      own preference, if I had the good fortune to have another
      son, would be to leave his little penis alone."</p>
