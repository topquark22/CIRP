            investigation</b></font><br />
             by Sandra Vogel-Hockley / Western Managing Editor</p>

            <p>The coroner's office is investigating the case of a
            five-week-old Penticton-area infant, who died from
            complications following a circumcision at Penticton
            Regional Hospital last week.</p>

            <p>The infant was sent home with his parents Tuesday
            morning, after undergoing the procedure to remove the
            foreskin from his penis. But concerns about bleeding
            sent them back to the hospital early Wednesday
            morning.</p>

            <p>The baby was flown by air ambulance to <a
            href="http://www.cw.bc.ca/index.asp"
            target="_blank">B.C. Children's Hospital</a>, where he
            died Aug. 22.</p>

            <p>"Because it is an unusual and quite unexpected
            death, we do investigate the circumstances around it,"
            said regional coroner Ian McKickan. "We have to review
            the entire situation."</p>

            <p>The cause of death has not been released, pending
            final autopsy results. A microscopic tissue and blood
            analysis is being conducted, to determine if the child
            had an underlying disorder such as haemophelia - a
            hereditary disorder which leaves those afflicted to
            bleed severely from even a slight injury due to the
            failure of the blood to clot.</p>

            <p>It could be three or four months before the
            coroner's final report is released.</p>

            <p>"It quite often takes some time to determine this
            type of thing," he said.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/general/baker1/"
            target="_blank">Deaths from complications after
            circumcision are rare</a> - a B.C. Coroner's office
            employee who recently catalogued thousands of cases
            said she cannot remember ever hearing of one in this
            province.</p>

            <p>Penticton Regional Hospital administrator Lorraine
            Ferguson said the hospital performs an average of three
            circumcisions a month. The surgery is performed using a
            local anesthetic.</p>

            <p>"<a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/1993.06.21_death/">This
            is a very rare occurrence</a>," she said of the death.
            "But with any surgery there is risk involved."</p>

            <p>Ferguson said Penticton Regional Hospital is
            undertaking its own investigation - in conjunction with
            the <a
            href="http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/abc/contacts.htm#iacs"
            target="_blank">coroner's office</a> - around the
            procedures involved in circumcision and into this death
            in particular.</p>

            <p>Circumcision is a much less common procedure now
            than in the past when most boys were circumcised soon
            after birth. Now the procedure is usually performed for
            religious reasons, most often for those of the Jewish
            or Muslim faiths.</p>

            <p>The procedure is <a
            href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm"
             target="_blank">no longer recommended</a> by the <a
            href="http://www.cps.ca/">Canadian Pediatric
            Society</a> and is not covered by provincial medical
            insurance.</p>

            <p>"This is a very unexpected incident," said Ferguson.
            "It's very tragic."</p>
