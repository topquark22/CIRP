            <h2>Dead initiate&rsquo;s surgeon sought</h2>
            <b>2008/06/16</b> By MALUNGELO BOOI Mthatha Bureau 

            <p>POLICE are investigating a case of murder following
            the death of a 13-year-old initiate at a Port St Johns
            circumcision school this week.<br />
            <br />
             Police spokesperson, Inspector Phumzile Njombela, said
            Lwandiso Msitho of Caguba village died at the
            initiation school on Tuesday.<br />
            <br />
             He said Msitho had been circumcised by a traditional
            surgeon at Lusikisiki without his parents&rsquo;
            consent and that they were hunting down the bogus
            surgeon who circumcised the underage boy without
            following proper procedures.<br />
            <br />
             Njombela said boys over the age of 16, but younger
            than 18 must have their parents&rsquo; permission
            before they can take part in such a ritual.<br />
            <br />
             &ldquo;We are also searching for his nurses to see
            whether they too cannot be charged as they did not
            report this (the boy being underage) to
            authorities,&rdquo; said Njombela.<br />
            <br />
             He said postmortem results had not yet been released,
            but Msitho&rsquo;s body was covered with fresh beating
            marks at the time of his death.<br />
            <br />
             Attempts to speak to the Msitho&rsquo;s parents were
            unsuccessful, but Njombela said the parents claimed
            they had never consented . <span class="yellow">On
            Thursday morning, a 16-year-old initiate from Slovo
            Park died, while a another 17-year-old died at Highbury
            in Mthatha.</span> In both cases inquest dockets have
            been opened. No arrests have been made</p>
            .
