            week</h2>

            <h4>Apart from deaths is ongoing possibility of
            initiates contracting HIV, says Health Department</h4>

            <p>By LULAMILE FENI</p>

            <p>Traditional Affairs Reporter</p>

            <p>SIX initiates have died and more than 50 have been
            rescued from illegal initiation schools in the
            Transkei.</p>

            <p>All the deaths happened during the first week of the
            start of the circumcision period in the Eastern
            Cape.</p>

            <p>Five were under 18 years of age &ndash; although the
            circumcision laws ban the initiation of boys under that
            age. The five were aged 13, 14, and 17 years old.</p>

            <p>The laws also demand compulsory screening of
            would-be initiates before they undergo the traditional
            ritual of passage to manhood.</p>

            <p>According to Health Department spokesperson Sizwe
            Kupelo, there were 13 young boys aged 13 who were found
            to have been circumcised in the area around Libode
            alone.</p>

            <p>Pondoland had &ndash; despite robust community
            awareness programmes by police, the Health Department
            and traditional leaders &ndash; continued to be the
            problematic area in the province.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;It is a sad situation and of great concern
            when young boys are dying like flies,&rdquo; said
            Kupelo.</p>

            <p>The deaths were reported in Ntabankulu, Flagstaff,
            Ngqeleni and Nyandeni village where the Western
            Pondoland Great Place is situated. The sixth death was
            reported yesterday afternoon at Sibangweni near Libode
            yesterday.</p>

            <p>In relation to the five circumcision deaths, Kupelo
            said five traditional surgeons had been arrested and
            police were hunting for two more suspects.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said all the six dead initiates had
            apparently undergone circumcision without their
            parents&rsquo; consent and knowledge, and had therefore
            not undergone the compulsory pre-circumcision medical
            examination demanded by the Act.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;But the problem is not only caused by boys
            who attend initiation without their parents&rsquo;
            consent, but the bigger problem lies with the people
            who conduct the circumcisions &ndash; iingcibi. I think
            that&rsquo;s where we need to pull the plug on
            this,&rdquo; said Kupelo.</p>

            <p>He said that traditional surgeons were also making
            the respected African rite a laughing stock and were
            charged a chicken for performing the procedure.</p>
            &ldquo;One of the things that kills these boys is that
            they walk about 100km to the home of iingcibi, are
            circumcised and walk back home to their respective
            village bleeding all the way,&rdquo; said Kupelo.<br />
            <br />
             &ldquo;Our worry is that apart from dying, there is a
            high possibility that the boys will end up contracting
            HIV,&rdquo; said Kupelo.<br />
            <br />
             

            <p>He said bogus traditional surgeons had received no
            training. They take a spear or a knife and move down
            the queue, cutting the first boy to the last without
            sterilising or washing the instrument.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;If the first has HIV, the rest will be
            infected ... people don&rsquo;t realise those
            consequences,&rdquo; he said.</p>

            <p>Of 54 initiates rescued from illegal circumcision
            schools, 24 were from Mkhankatho near Libode. Thirty
            initiates were rescued from an initiation school in
            Qumbu with gangrenous and septic circumcision wounds,
            Kupelo said.</p>

            <p>There were 400 officials on standby to monitor the
            initiation season around Transkei.</p>

            <p>Although there had as yet been no deaths reported in
            the greater East London area, police had conducted
            workshops to spread awareness of the law.</p>

            <p>Police spokesperson Captain Errol Francis said that
            the workshop came after it was noticed that a number of
            people were contravening the law.</p>

            <p>Now the community, Health Department and police have
            entered into an agreement to assist each other for the
            sake of the rite.</p>

            <p>Francis said this exercise is to be spread across
            Buffalo City Municipal area. &mdash; Additional
