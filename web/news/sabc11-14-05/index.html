            <h4>About 125 boys have died of circumcision related
            illnesses since 2001</h4>
            November 14, 2005, 07:00 

            <p>Police in East London are still searching for a
            young man in his twenties who has been accused of
            conducting illegal circumcisions on seven boys. This
            comes after Monwabisi Goqwana, the health MEC, and
            departmental officials got a tip off from the community
            and conducted a raid at initiation schools around
            Mdantsane over the weekend.</p>

            <p>The initiation schools were empty when police and
            the health officials arrived. Apparently the initiates
            got a tip off about the impending raid and fled. The
            police dog unit was called in - and the boys were
            found. Most are under age and have no medical
            certificates nor permission from their parents as
            required by the law.</p>

            <p>Siyabulela Mamkeli, the youth forum chairperson,
            said: "There were death threats to one of these guys
            who went to the bush, a revenge for something he did to
            a member of the community. They threatened to kill him,
            then he said he wanted to go to the hospital instead of
            him dying in the bush."</p>

            <p>Medical examinations have revealed that the boys'
            situation is satisfactory.</p>
