      <h2>Boy bleeds to death after circumcision</h2>

      <p>Thohoyandou - A ten-year-old Northern Province boy bled to
      death on Monday after being circumcised at an initiation
      school, African Eye News Service reports.</p>

      <p>Patrick Mandiza of Malavuwe village, near Thohoyandou, was
      rushed to Tshilidzini Hospital in Thohoyandou when he began
      bleeding profusely at about 15:00, said Far North police
      spokesperson Captain Ailwei Mushavhanamadi on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>"Unfortunately, he was certified dead on arrival at the
      hospital," Mushavhanamadi said.</p>

      <p>Police have launched an inquest into the boy's death.</p>

      <p>Mushavhanamadi said police had established that the boy
      had been at the school since Saturday, but were not sure when
      he was circumcised.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, police at Calcutta in Bushbuckridge are
      searching for six men who allegedly dragged a young man to an
      initiation school where his scrotum was sliced with a blade
      on June 17.</p>

      <p>Jerry Mbatha, 20, of Tsemamarhumbu village claimed he was
      mutilated as punishment for being a suspected burglar.</p>

      <p>Ointment was rubbed onto the wound and he slept for three
      hours and woke up alone. He then escaped and went to
      Matikwane Hospital for treatment. A woman has been arrested
      in connection with the incident.</p>

      <p>Beatrice Nkuna, 40, has not been asked to plead on charges
      of abduction and attempted murder and will appear in the
      Mkhuhlu Magistrates' Court again on July 16. She is out on a
      warning.</p>

      <p>In a similar incident, a 22-year-old man from Kildare
      village, also in Bushbuckridge, was taken from his wife and
      child on June 16 and partially circumcised at a circumcision
      school.</p>

      <p>He was able to escape the next night. No arrests have been
      made. - African Eye News Service</p>
