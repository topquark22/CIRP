      <h2>Eighth Initiation School Student Dies in Northern
      Province</h2>

      <p>Another initiation school student died in the Northern
      Province on Wednesday, bringing to eight the number of deaths
      at such schools in the province this winter.</p>

      <p>Six of the reported deaths occurred in the province's
      Lowveld area while two took place in the Far North.</p>

      <p>On Wednesday, Reginald Kubhayi, 14, died upon arrival at
      Letaba Hospital in Tzaneen after being circumcised at an
      initiation school in Nyakelani and complaining of stomach
      pains.</p>

      <p>This is the second incident in the same school within a
      week. Promise Mkhawane, 15, died there last Friday, also
      after complaining of stomach pains.</p>

      <p>According to post mortems conducted on Mkhawane and four
      other boys who died in the Lowveld Area, they succumbed to
      pneumonia, said police spokesman Inspector Moatshe
      Ngoepe.</p>

      <p>The boys were aged between 13 and 17 and attended
      initiation schools in Nabane village in Maake near Tzaneen,
      Shigalo village near Malamulele, Mokgolobatho village near
      Ritavi and Boshakge village, near Tzaneen.</p>

      <p>The number of deaths at the circumcision schools has
      alarmed provincial health officials who have urged
      circumcision school owners to work closely with hospitals and
      local clinics. The health department has offered to give
      antiseptics, disinfectants and relevant medication to the
      schools.</p>

      <p>Gauteng's health department is helping the North-West
      health department investigate the deaths of two initiates in
      North-West on Sunday.</p>

      <p>Both youths died at Jubilee hospital in Hammanskraal, from
      an allegedly botched traditional circumcision. So far, 12
      initiation school deaths have been reported in North-West,
      while no deaths have reported in Gauteng.</p>

      <p>Thousands of boys attend initiation schools each winter
      where they are circumcised with a sharp instrument as part of
      their passage into manhood. - African Eye News Service</p>
