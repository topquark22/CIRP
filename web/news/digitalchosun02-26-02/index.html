      <h2>Local Circumcision Rates Lead World</h2>

      <p class="text">Nine out of ten male high school students and 60% of the
      entire male population are circumcised, according to research
      conducted by <a href="http://www.snu.ac.kr/">Seoul National
      University</a>'s physiology professor Kim Dae-sik and
      president of GenDix Bang Myeong-geol, on 5434 males and their
      fathers aged 0 to 92. It is the first large-scale interview
      research on frequency of phimosectomy, and the <a href="/library/cultural/pang1/">results</a> have
      been published on January issue of British Journal of Urology
      International.</p>

      <p class="text">According to the thesis, over 90% of high school students
      were circumcised while less than 10% of elderly older than 70
      had the operation. The average of the entire population was
      estimated to be around 60%, far higher than Canada and
      England's some 10% to 30% level. The research team revealed
      that the circumcision operation rate, which was below 0.1% in
      1945, rapidly increased, annual operation numbers surpassing
      annual male birth rate, adding that it is an unprecedented
      situation in the world.</p>

      <p class="text">While 41% of the 267 urologists practice the operation,
      only five doctors answered correctly to four questions on
      phimosiectomy. A higher percentage of doctors who themselves
      are circumcised practice the operation than those who are
      not, 72% to 56%.</p>

      <p class="text">The project evaluated the country's unique phenomenon
      originated from medical misunderstanding and group pressure.
      The research team was awarded human rights award from <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/">National Organization of
      Circumcision Information Resource Centers</a> for its
      contribution on circumcision, last year.</p>
