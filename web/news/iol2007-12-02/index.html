            <h2>Traditional surgeon, nurse arrested</h2>

            <p>A traditional surgeon and a nurse were arrested on
            Sunday after a <span class="yellow">youth died during
            an illegal circumcision</span>, the <a href=""
            target="_blank">Eastern Cape department of health</a>
            said.<br />
            <br />
             Spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said a 22-year-old
            traditional surgeon and a 25-year-old nurse were
            arrested and are been held at the Libode police station
            in connection with the death.<br />
            <br />
             They are expected to appear in the Libode magistrate's
            court on Monday.<br />
            <br />
             An 18-year-old youth died at an illegal initiation
            school in Gxulu Village, Umtata, and six others are in
            hospital.<br />
            <br />
             Kupelo said: "At this stage we do not know if the boy
            died from complications during the circumcision or
            through natural causes."<br />
            <br />
             According to the Department to Health the law states
            that all initiates should go for pre-examinations at
            hospitals before an initiation.<br />
            <br />
             "Some of these boys are already sick and do not go for
            these examinations. Due to this they have complications
            and some of them die," he said.<br />
            <br />
             Health officials have been deployed in the area to
            find these initiation schools and spread
            awareness.<br />
            <br />
             Kupelo said 60 health officials have already been
            deployed to find these illegal initiation
            schools.<br />
            <br />
             Another traditional surgeon was arrested on Thursday
            for conduction illegal circumcisions.<br />
            <br />
             "Ten underage boys also escaped from an initiation
            school when health official arrived," he said.<br />
            <br />
             The department of health, the house of traditional
            leaders together with the police are embarking on a
            week long monitoring campaign in the Eastern cape. -
