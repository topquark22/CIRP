      <h2>Doctor on Death Charge</h2>

      <p>Apr 27 2001</p>

      <p>by Neil McKay, The Journal</p>

      <p>A surgeon has been charged with the manslaughter of a
      20-year-old disabled man who died following a routine
      operation more than three years ago.</p>

      <p>Dr Pravin Chaturabi Patel is due to appear before
      magistrates in Chester-le- Street on Monday, charged with the
      manslaughter of Andrew Ryan, of Pilgrim's Way, Gilesgate,
      Durham City.</p>

      <p>Andrew, who was wheelchair-bound and suffered from
      muscular dystrophy, died following a routine 15-minute
      circumcision at Shotley Bridge Hospital, Consett, County
      Durham, in July 1997.</p>

      <p>Yesterday detectives formally charged Dr Patel when he
      kept a pre- arranged appointment at Harrow-on-the-Hill police
      station, Middlesex, to answer bail.</p>

      <p>Last night Durham Constabulary issued a statement saying:
      "A consultant surgeon was today charged with manslaughter at
      the conclusion of a long- running police investigation into
      the death of a patient at <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~ndahnt/">Shotley Bridge
      Hospital</a>.</p>

      <p>"Dr Pravin Chaturabi Patel, 51, of Kenton Road, Harrow,
      Middlesex, was charged with the manslaughter of Andrew
      Ryan.</p>

      <p>"Andrew died following a routine operation in July 1997.
      At the time Dr Patel was a locum consultant surgeon at
      Shotley Bridge.</p>

      <p>"He was bailed to appear before Chester-le-Street
      magistrates on Monday, April 30, at 1.30pm."</p>

      <p>Andrew lived with his parents in Durham City, who were not
      prepared to comment last night.</p>
