      <h2>Circumcision debate hits state</h2>

      <p>MIKE STOBBE<br />
      Staff Writer</p>

      <p>Charlotte homemaker Beth Long started lobbying against
      circumcision after her firstborn son bled for five days
      following the procedure.</p>

      <p>Now she's part of a small but determined group of North
      Carolinians trying to convince the state to stop paying for
      Medicaid circumcisions.</p>

      <p>"I'm amazed they can get away with this -- spend almost $2
      million a year to do a cosmetic surgery not endorsed by any
      medical board in the world," Long said.</p>

      <p>This week, the <a
      href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Senate/Senate.html"
      target="_blank">N.C. Senate</a> is to consider a spending
      plan that would curtail Medicaid funding for circumcision in
      this state.</p>

      <p>Long and her allies say the state shouldn't spend money on
      a procedure that's medically unnecessary when legislators are
      considering cutting home care for the disabled and dental
      care for low-income families.</p>

      <p>But advocates for funding Medicaid circumcisions --
      including some doctors and Medicaid parents -- say they fear
      that boys from low-income families will be stigmatized
      because they look different.</p>

      <p>The issue is complex, even for legislators like state Sen.
      <a
      href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/senate/senator.pl?nUserID=51"
       target="_blank">William Purcell</a>, D-Laurinburg, a
      pediatrician who has performed thousands of circumcisions
      over the years.</p>

      <p>"I don't know what the final decision will be," he
      said.</p>

      <h4>State almost cut funding</h4>

      <p>North Carolina's legislators briefly eliminated Medicaid
      funding for circumcisions last fall. The Medicaid program
      stopped paying doctors for routine newborn circumcision
      claims Nov. 1. But Medicaid resumed paying Jan. 1, after a
      backlash from physicians, some Medicaid patients -- and <a
      href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/" target="_blank">Gov.
      Mike Easley</a>.</p>

      <p>Easley heard about the funding cut from Dr. Sandy Easley
      of Washington, N.C., his brother and a legislative liaison
      for a state association of obstetricians and
      gynecologists.</p>

      <p>"I called my closest contact in state government, my
      brother," Sandy Easley recalled. "He was quite surprised this
      had happened, and got his people to look into it."</p>

      <p>Gov. Easley wouldn't comment for this article. A
      spokeswoman, Cari Boyce, said Easley brought it to the
      attention of N.C. Secretary of Health and Human Services <a
      href="http://www.dhhs.state.nc.us/docs/division.htm#secretary"
       target="_blank">Carmen Hooker Odom</a>, who worked with
      legislators to restore the funding.</p>

      <p>Victoria Brown of Walstonburg, who wrote to <a
      href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/" target="_blank">Gov.
      Easley</a> about circumcision, got a Dec. 20 reply that said
      in part:</p>

      <p>"My vision of North Carolina has always been of a unified
      North Carolina, not a state divided by social and class
      lines. People should not be indelibly branded as economically
      disadvantaged because their parents could not afford this
      simple procedure when they were born. I believe Medicaid
      funding for this procedure is money well spent."</p>

      <p>Boyce said the letter, sent on official stationery, wasn't
      approved by Easley and doesn't reflect his opinion. "We have
      an auto-pen. Someone had the letter signed and sent out."</p>

      <h4>For, against circumcision</h4>

      <p>Circumcision is a surgical procedure to remove the
      foreskin from a young boy's penis, usually done in under 10
      minutes. It's been practiced by Jews and Muslims for
      thousands of years, but didn't become common in this country
      until the 20th century.</p>

      <p>Doctors advocated it as hygienic, because circumcision
      prevents accumulation of secretions under the foreskin.</p>

      <p>In 1870, only 5 percent of U.S. male newborns were
      circumcised. By 1900, it was 25 percent, and by 1980, it was
      85 percent, according to the <a href="http://www.icgi.org/"
      target="_blank">International Coalition for Genital
      Integrity</a>, an anti-circumcision group.</p>

      <p>Then, percentages began dropping. In 2000, it was down to
      about 55 percent. One factor was a greater influx of
      immigrants from cultures where circumcision isn't
      commonplace.</p>

      <p>Also, many doctors stopped making medical arguments for
      it. In 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics said it would
      no longer recommend circumcision.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, an anti-circumcision movement started about 20
      years ago, mainly in California.</p>

      <p>In North Carolina, a loose-knit movement formed about 10
      years ago, said <a href="http://www.nocircnc.org/amber.htm"
      target="_blank">Amber Craig</a>, N.C. director for the <a
      href="http://www.nocircnc.org/" target="_blank">National
      Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers</a>
      (NOCIRC).</p>

      <p>Today, about 30 people across the state regularly
      participate in parent education and lobbying efforts. The
      group includes parents and a few doctors.</p>

      <p>Last month, 112 people signed a <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/news/ncopenletter05-08-02/">letter</a>
      opposing Medicaid circumcisions that was addressed to Easley
      and the General Assembly and published as a full-page ad in a
      weekly Raleigh newspaper.</p>

      <p>In South Carolina, Medicaid officials say they haven't
      seen funding for circumcisions challenged. S.C. Medicaid
      spends $650,000 yearly on the procedure.</p>

      <h4>A small dent</h4>

      <p>N.C. Medicaid spends about $2 million a year on
      circumcisions, including state and federal money. In
      contrast, state officials plan to spend around $14 billion
      overall in the next fiscal year.</p>

      <p>"It's small potatoes," said state Rep. Connie Wilson,
      R-Mecklenburg.</p>

      <p>Each year, about 52 percent of N.C. Medicaid male newborns
      are circumcised. In South Carolina, it's 71 percent.</p>

      <p>A study last year by NOCIRC's Craig and others found a
      higher proportion of Medicaid newborns were circumcised in
      states that paid $60 or more for the procedure.</p>

      <p>North Carolina's Medicaid program pays $123.73 for a
      standard circumcision performed in a hospital. S.C. Medicaid
      pays $65.16.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.nocircnc.org/kbaker.htm"
      target="_blank">Dr. Kenneth Baker</a>, a Monroe obstetrician
      with NOCIRC, said colleagues have talked about Medicaid
      circumcision as a quick, dependable source of income.</p>

      <p>"It's very simple. If you do four or five, it's an easy
      thousand dollars a day," Baker said. "They (some doctors)
      were very upset about losing that."</p>

      <p>Easley and other physicians disputed that claim.</p>

      <p>"I think that's ludicrous," Easley said. "It's not an
      economic issue. It's an issue of fairness."</p>

      <p>Medicaid officials say funding circumcision is not as
      crucial as maintaining other services.</p>

      <p>"Anything not medically necessary is an expense we should
      not have," said Nina Yeager, the state's <a
      href="http://www.dhhs.state.nc.us/dma/"
      target="_blank">Medicaid</a> director.</p>

      <p>Wilson said the outcome may not depend on medical
      arguments.</p>

      <p>"I use circumcision as an example of the way the political
      process works," she said. "If you can't cut circumcisions,
      what can you cut?"</p>
