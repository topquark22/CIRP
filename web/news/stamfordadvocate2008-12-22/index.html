            <h2>Parents' perseverence helps in diagnosis of baby's
            rare malady</h2>
            The Advocate Staff<br />
             Posted: 12/22/2008 09:50:34 AM EST 

            <p>Their pediatrician, thinking it might be caused by
            acid reflux, prescribed medication. After several
            weeks, the crying largely ceased. At 3 months, Matthew
            began wheezing. The pediatrician diagnosed
            bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the small passages in
            the lungs caused by a virus. Bronchiolitis can be a
            precursor to asthma, which is common in Anna's family.
            The doctor told her Matthew would probably have the
            airway disease when he got older and prescribed
            medicine to be administered in aerosolized form through
            a nebulizer.<br />
            <br />
             Several pediatricians and changes of medicine later,
            the Nelsons were sent to the hospital for blood tests
            and a chest X-ray. The radiologist noted that the
            baby's heart was slightly enlarged, which disturbed
            Anna. Doctors, she says, assured her it was nothing to
            worry about.<br />
            <br />
             Jason departed on his long-planned business trip,
            leaving Anna to juggle an active 2-year-old and a sick
            4-month-old who seemed to be worsening. Matthew wasn't
            interested in eating and wheezed continuously; Anna was
            going to the pediatrician every other day.<br />
            <br />
             "I was exhausted and getting maybe two hours of sleep
            at a time," she recalls, saying that she "lost it" when
            the office balked at telephoning Children's for an
            appointment. "I called Jason and said, 'I don't know
            what to do and I need help.' "<br />
            <br />
             At the Fairfax outpatient center the next week, both a
            nurse practitioner and a pulmonologist agreed that the
            nebulizer treatment wasn't helping. After listening to
            the description of Matthew's illness and scrutinizing
            the X-ray that had ruled out pneumonia, the
            pulmonologist asked Martin, the cardiologist, to look
            at the baby.<br />
            <br />
             Anna remembers that Martin chatted briefly with them,
            then "just stared at the baby for two minutes. I
            thought, well, that's weird." Jason remembers Martin
            asking three questions: Did Matthew scream a lot when
            he came home? Did the screaming stop after a while? Is
            he getting better or worse?<br />
            <br />
             Martin then scooped up the baby, saying he'd be back
            shortly. Martin recalls he was all but certain he knew
            what the problem was, but when he confided his
            suspicion to his colleagues before tests confirmed it,
            "Everyone looked at me like I was a little bit
            insane."<br />
            <br />
             Less than 10 minutes later he reappeared, looking
            somber but calm.<br />
            <br />
             "I'm going to be blunt," he told the Nelsons,
            according to Jason's recollection. "Your son does not
            have asthma. He's had a heart attack and is in heart
            failure, and he's going to have surgery within 24
            hours." Matthew had "cardiac asthma," wheezing
            associated with heart failure. <span class="yellow">The
            seizure he'd had during circumcision was actually a
            heart attack.</span> Martin explained that a team was
            en route to whisk the baby to Children's Hospital,
            where Richard Jonas, the cardiothoracic pediatric
            surgeon who had operated on Martin's nephew for the
            same problem, would try to save the baby's life.<br />
            <br />
             "It was just unbelievable," Jason recalls.<br />
            <br />
             Matthew's problem, diagnosed by echocardiogram and
            apparent on a second X-ray, was precisely what Martin
            had suspected: an anomalous left coronary artery from
            the pulmonary artery, or <a
            href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/893290-overview"
             target="_blank">ALCAPA</a>. The extremely rare
            condition occurs early in fetal development when the
            left coronary artery is connected to the pulmonary
            artery, which carries oxygen-poor blood, instead of to
            the aorta. Deprived of sufficient oxygen, the heart
            starts to die, leading to a heart attack, according to
            the federal government's Medline information
            service.<br />
            <br />
             Left untreated, about 90 percent of babies born with
            the condition do not survive their first year. Of the
            500 pediatric heart patients seen annually at
            Children's Hospital, only two or three have ALCAPA,
            according to Martin. "With prompt treatment, these kids
            can have excellent outcomes," he says.<br />
            <br />
             Common symptoms include uncontrolled crying, often
            mistaken for colic, which occurs about the same age.
            The baby's reflux was actually angina, chest pain that
            occurs when the heart isn't getting enough blood,
            Martin says. The slightly enlarged heart, along with
            the persistent wheezing, was the tip-off, Martin says.
            Both should have triggered a prompt referral to a
            cardiologist.<br />
            <br />
             "Babies may wheeze with a respiratory infection, but
            they should get better within a few days," Martin says.
            The second X-ray showed that Matthew's heart was 30
            percent bigger than normal.<br />
            <br />
             Matthew had another heart attack while being readied
            for surgery, Jason says. The couple was told their son
            had an 80 percent chance of surviving the 6
            &frac12;-hour operation, in which the artery was
            removed from its incorrect location and connected to
            the aorta. There were other worries, too, about
            postoperative infection and the inevitable long wait to
            see whether he would develop normally.<br />
            <br />
             Those concerns have been laid to rest. "He's a loud,
            typically obnoxious 4-year-old who plays football," his
            father says. Matthew now sees Martin once a year; he
            has no restrictions and seems unscathed by his
            ordeal.<br />
            <br />
             "There is no doubt in my mind that Dr. Martin saved
            his life," Jason says. "We were one of the lucky
            ones."</p>
