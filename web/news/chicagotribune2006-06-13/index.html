            <h2>Doctors differ on circumcision need</h2>

            <p>By Judy Peres<br />
             Tribune staff reporter<br />
             Published June 13, 2006, 8:44 PM CDT</p>

            <p>In a <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/chicagotribune2006-02-17/"
             target="_blank">case</a> that has drawn the attention
            of anti-circumcision groups nationwide, doctors
            testified Tuesday that there is no medical
            justification for removing the foreskin of an
            8-year-old Northbrook boy.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.georgetownuniversityhospital.org/body.cfm?ID=8&amp;?CFID=9076&amp;CFTOKEN=51302326&amp;UserAction=DoctorDetails&amp;doctorid=4746"
             target="_blank">Dr. M. David Gibbons</a> of
            Washington, D.C., a pediatric urologist, said he saw
            nothing in the boy's medical records to warrant
            circumcision, an operation he said could cause serious
            complications.</p>

            <p>But the boy's pediatrician, Dr. Arnold Goldstein of
            Highland Park, said he believed circumcision was the
            "best and easiest way" to prevent problems in the
            future.</p>

            <p>The boy's mother insists, on the advice of Goldstein
            and two other doctors, that the operation is necessary
            to prevent recurring bouts of inflammation, called
            balanitis.</p>

            <p>His father, a building manager from Arlington
            Heights, is suing to block the operation, calling it an
            "unnecessary amputation" that could cause his son
            irreparable physical and emotional harm.</p>

            <p>"If you have an infection in your finger, you don't
            cut it off," the father said from the witness stand.
            "First you try to treat it."</p>

            <p>The parents are divorced. The Tribune is not naming
            them to protect the boy's privacy.</p>

            <p>Gibbons and <a
            href="http://www.mgh.org/directry/docmgh/vanhowr1.html"
            target="_blank">Dr. Robert Van Howe</a>, a pediatrician
            from Marquette, Mich., said balonitis, often caused by
            chemical irritants, is nearly always treatable with a
            steroid ointment.</p>

            <p>Goldstein admitted the boy never received a steroid.
            The only medication recommended was an antibiotic
            ointment such as Neosporin, which Goldstein
            acknowledged did not help. The two experts said
            Neosporin is not recommended for balanitis and
            sometimes even causes inflammation.</p>

            <p>Goldstein also testified that the boy had a history
            of phimosis, or adherence of the foreskin to the head
            of the penis. But he conceded under cross-examination
            that he could not document such a history in the
            child's chart.</p>

            <p>Gibbons and Van Howe testified that phimosis is
            normal for a child of this age.</p>

            <p>"Sixty-five percent of 9-year-old boys still have a
            partially attached foreskin," Gibbons said. The boy
            will turn 9 next month.</p>

            <p>"Intactivist" groups are eagerly awaiting Kaplan's
            ruling, which could break new legal ground.</p>

            <p>"If the court were to rule that circumcision is not
            in the best interests of this child, that would set an
            American precedent that doesn't exist today," said
            George Hill, director of bioethics for <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposed to
            Circumcision</a>.</p>

            <p>In his opening statement, <a
            href="http://www.lawyers.com/lawyers/Atlanta/Georgia/David%20J.%20Llewellyn/attorney.html?a=0761-LDS&amp;co=&amp;b=A101006875805"
             target="_blank">David Llewellyn</a>, one of the
            father's attorneys, told <a
            href="http://www.cookcountycourt.org/"
            target="_blank">Cook County Circuit Court</a> Judge
            Jordan Kaplan that routine circumcision became popular
            in the 1870s in a "misguided attempt to punish and
            deter masturbation." But doctors now know it is rarely
            medically necessary, he said, and its risks outweigh
            its benefits.</p>

            <p>Llewellyn, an Atlanta attorney who specializes in
            circumcision cases, said the boy's penis is normal.
            Surgically removing the boy's foreskin, he said, would
            cause pain and discomfort for a significant period of
            time and would be sexually and possibly psychologically
            damaging.</p>

            <p>The hearing is expected to continue Wednesday with a
            pediatric urologist testifying on behalf of the
            mother.</p>

            <p>DOC's executive director, John Geisheker of Seattle,
            said he has a special empathy with the boy at the
            center of the dispute.</p>

            <p>Born 60 years ago in New Zealand, where routine
            circumcision of newborns was not common, Geisheker said
            in an interview that he was circumcised at age 5 when
            an American doctor persuaded his mother it was
            medically necessary because his foreskin was still
            attached.</p>

            <p>"Today we know that it can take up to 17 years for
            the membrane (that attaches the foreskin to the head of
            the penis) to dissolve so that the foreskin can
            completely retract," said Geisheker.</p>

            <p>Geisheker said he has no real memory of the
            experience, although his mother remembers it well.</p>

            <p>"In those days&mdash;unlike today&mdash;it was
            common to use no anesthesia," he said. "They just
            strapped me down and ordered her out of the room. She
            had to listen to me scream."</p>

            <p>His mother, he said, "now accosts pregnant women in
            the grocery store" to urge them not to circumcise their
            newborn sons.</p>

            <p>Geisheker, a lawyer, said he hoped Kaplan would
            prevent the circumcision now and let the child "make
            his own decision when he's 18. In the meantime, the
            problem might well resolve on its own."</p>

            <p>Harry Meislahn of Winnetka, who heads the
            Chicago-area chapter of NOCIRC, the National
            Organization of Circumcision Information Resource
            Centers, said supporters are contributing to a fund set
            up to help cover legal expenses.</p>

            <p>Llewellyn is serving pro bono. Marilyn Milos, the
            director of <a href="http://www.nocirc.org"
            target="_blank">NOCIRC</a>, said supporters had raised
            enough money &ndash; "several thousand dollars" &ndash;
            to pay the expenses of the expert witnesses.</p>

            <p>Alan Toback and <a
            href="http://chicago.citysearch.com/profile/38436791/chicago_il/d_arco_john_m_lake_toback_d_arco.html"
             target="_blank">John D'Arco</a>, the father's local
            counsel, said they had not received payment from anyone
            other than their client.</p>
