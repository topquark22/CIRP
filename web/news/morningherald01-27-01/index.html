      <h2>Terror attacks in the name of religion</h2>
      <b>By Lindsay Murdoch</b> 

      <p>Circumcision has been forced on hundreds of Christians,
      including children and pregnant women, in a campaign by
      extremists to spread Islam through the war-ravaged Maluku
      islands.</p>

      <p>Victims have told the <i>Herald</i> of multiple cuttings
      with the same knives and razors that caused many to suffer
      infections.</p>

      <p>In the biggest city in the islands, Ambon, church and
      other groups have gathered evidence that 3,928 villagers on
      at least six islands have been forced to convert to Islam
      under the threat of death, torture or destruction of their
      homes.</p>

      <p>They believe that local Muslim clerics, possibly under
      duress from extremists, circumcised almost all the
      converts.</p>

      <p>Moderate Muslim leaders have condemned the forced
      conversions and circumcisions, saying they are contrary to
      Islamic teachings.</p>

      <p>The Muslim Governor of Maluku, Saleh Latuconsina, this
      week led an investigation team to the island of Kesui, 420
      kilometres south-east of Ambon City, after receiving an
      official report in late December confirming villagers there
      converted to Islam against their will and were
      circumcised.</p>

      <p>Several hundred former Christians on the island are
      expected to be taken by Indonesian navy ship to refugee camps
      on Tual, a nearby island. A group of 172 Christians from
      Kesui, who have already been evacuated to Ambon City, tell
      horrific stories about forced circumcisions by local Muslims
      who they say were pressured by Muslim zealots from two other
      islands, Geser and Gorong.</p>

      <p>Kostantinus Idi, 22, told the <i>Herald</i> that he
      chanted prayers to convert to Islam as Muslims brandishing
      machetes threatened to kill him and his family. "I was
      scared. They could do anything to me if I did not do what
      they wanted," he said.</p>

      <p>Idi said that after being given a Muslim cap, prayer mat
      and sarong and being told to give himself an Islamic name, he
      tried to avoid circumcision by running to a relative's house.
      Three Muslim men came to the house, where nine other
      Christian men were also hiding.</p>

      <p>"I could not escape," he said. "One of them held up my
      foreskin between pieces of wood while another cut me with a
      razor ... the third man held my head back, ready to pour
      water down my throat if I screamed. "But I couldn't help but
      scream and he poured the water. I kept screaming aloud and
      vomited. I couldn't stand the pain."</p>

      <p>Idi said one of the clerics urinated on his wound, saying
      it would stop infection.</p>

      <p>"All of the men at the house were cut using the same
      razor," he said. "That night they circumcised about 60 men. I
      was bleeding all over and had nothing to cover my wound. I
      was told to take a bath but it kept bleeding until the next
      day. I could not imagine any greater pain. One of my friends
      got infected and was taken to hospital when we arrived in
      Ambon."</p>

      <p>Christina Sagat, 32, said her mother, who is in her 70s,
      teenagers and children and her eight months pregnant niece
      were among people from her village on Kesui who were
      circumcised.</p>

      <p>Sagat said that Muslim Ambonese women were not usually
      circumcised. "I don't understand these people ... they
      insisted on us being circumcised," she said.</p>

      <p>The Rev Sammy Titaley, the head of the Protestant church
      in Maluku, said the circumcisions were considered worse than
      death in Ambonese culture.</p>

      <p>"Going back centuries we have a tradition of death," he
      said. "Tradition had it that if you married, you had to bring
      a head on a stick to the bride's family to show that you were
      able to protect her," Titaley said. "But we have never before
      seen anything like forced circumcisions in these islands.
      This is especially terrible for the women. How can they do
      that? Even Muslim women are not circumcised like this ... it
      is forbidden in Islam.''</p>

      <p>Moderate Muslim leaders in Ambon City have distanced
      themselves from the conversions and circumcisions. They deny
      any campaign to force Islam on Christians. Malik Selang, the
      executive secretary of the Maluku chapter of the Indonesian
      Muslim Board, denied Muslims were responsible.</p>

      <p>"Kesui island was Muslim-dominated until Christian
      missionaries came to the area," he said. "The Christians and
      Muslims used to live in harmony there but some Christians
      from Ambon went there and created rumours ... they provoked
      both sides into conflict.</p>

      <p>"Some Christians came to a mosque and said they wanted to
      convert to Islam ... we do not force anyone to become Muslim.
      It is not considered a good deed."</p>

      <p>Selang said Islamic teaching prohibited the forced
      conversion of someone from another religion to Islam. "It is
      against the Koran and against the teachings of the
      Prophet."</p>

      <p>Speaking in Ambon City, an Austrian-born Catholic priest,
      Joseph Haas, said that threats and attacks by Muslim fanatics
      last year forced to him to flee Bula, a once Christian
      village on Ceram, the so-called "mother" island of Maluku.
      But he said when he went back to his looted and badly damaged
      church in the village recently, local Muslims pleaded with
      him to stay.</p>

      <p>"I had to tell them, look, I don't have any Christian
      worshippers here any more ... they have all fled," he
      said.</p>

      <p>Haas said many of the Muslims were also victims, including
      the clerics. "From what I hear, they cannot refuse to do the
      circumcisions," he said. "They are sincere and believe deeply
      in their religion. But others behind them are forcing
      them."</p>

      <p>Haas, who has worked in Indonesia for almost 40 years,
      said he could not think of a worse thing to happen to the
      villagers.</p>

      <p>Church officials say that the eastern half of Ceram, the
      largest island in Maluku, is now entirely Islamic.
      Protestants and Catholics cannot enter villages there for
      fear of attack. The Board of Lawyers for Ambon Churches
      claims it has gathered information about the forced
      conversion of about 1,500 people on Buru, a remote island
      near Ceram where former president Soeharto sent political
      prisoners in the late 1960s. The board claims that 1,300
      Christians have been forced to convert on Bacan, an island
      closer to Irian Jaya (West Papua).</p>

      <p>But the board's co-ordinator, Sammy Waileruny, said lack
      of communications with these and other islands where forced
      conversions are believed to have taken place made it
      impossible to know how widespread the action had been.</p>

      <p>The testimonies of the Kesui refugees who have reached
      Ambon City are the only ones taken so far. Maluku's police
      chief, Brigadier-General Firman Gani, told the <i>Herald</i>
      that he understood Christians on Kesui "were in some kind of
      condition in which they could not freely choose their
      religion". "The police will respond," he said. "We will
      investigate. We are part of the governor's team going
      there."</p>

      <p>Governor Latuconsina, who refused to be interviewed by
      <i>Herald</i>, is understood to have been shocked when he
      read a report of events on Kesui dated December 19. The
      report, a copy of which has been obtained by the
      <i>Herald</i>, confirmed that Christians who had "surrendered
      because they could not stand it any more" had been
      circumcised after being brought to a mosque.</p>
