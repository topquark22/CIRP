            <p><i>By Steven P. Wagner</i></p>

            <p><a
            href="mailto:swagner@forumcomm.com">swagner@forumcomm.com</a></p>

            <p>The Forum - 18 Dec. 02</p>

            <p>A <a href="http://www.co.cass.nd.us/"
            target="_blank">Cass County</a> jury could be the
            nation's first to decide what hospitals must tell
            parents before circumcising boys.</p>

            <p>To make their decision easier, <a
            href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a> wants to show jurors
            taped footage of a doctor removing the foreskin from a
            baby boy's penis.</p>

            <p>"This is the practice I think is absolutely
            barbaric," Baer said while preparing for a pre-trial
            hearing today.</p>

            <p>"What parent would consent to do it? I don't know of
            many who would after receiving that information," he
            said.</p>

            <p>The hearing will shape several legal issues for a
            landmark trial, likely the nation's first of its kind,
            slated to start 3 Feb.</p>

            <p>Three years ago, Anita and James Flatt of Hawley,
            Minn., filed a lawsuit on behalf of their son, now 5,
            against <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734"
             target="_blank">Dr. Sunita Kantak</a>, <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Medical Center</a> and the
            state of North Dakota, claiming they weren't
            sufficiently informed about the procedure.</p>

            <p>If they had known more about circumcision, they
            would have chosen to forgo it, Baer said.</p>

            <p>"Medical doctors don't tell the patient, or the
            parents, complete information about the procedure," he
            said.</p>

            <p>"The medical community is perpetuating these results
            in 50% of the population &hellip; without the benefit
            of a medical diagnosis. There is no medical reason to
            do it on a routine basis."</p>

            <p>The hospital contends <a
            href="http://www.zbaer.com/anita.htm"
            target="_blank">Anita Flatt</a> was given information
            about circumcision and gave doctors consent to perform
            the procedure.</p>

            <p>"All parents that have sons born at MeritCare are
            given information on circumcision," said hospital
            spokeswoman Carrie Johnson.</p>

            <p>"This information educates parents about
            circumcision and allows them to make an informed choice
            that factors in their own personal beliefs and
            preferences," she said.</p>

            <p>Angela Lord, a MeritCare lawyer, deferred all
            questions to the hospital.</p>

            <p>In court papers, the hospital claims it doesn't
            routinely recommend circumcision and the Flatts
            requested it be done on their son.</p>

            <p>Previously, the Flatts' claim about the legality of
            North Dakota's law was dismissed by a judge.</p>

            <p>The Flatts' son was born early 6 March 1997. That
            evening, a nurse asked Flatt to sign a consent form for
            circumcision but didn't describe the benefits or risks
            of the procedure, according to the lawsuit.</p>

            <p>At the time, she was medicated for pain. The next
            day, Kantak spoke briefly with her but didn't discuss
            the benefits, risks or potential complications and
            James Flatt was never consulted.</p>

            <p>The hospital, though, says Anita Flatt made the
            decision for her son before Kantak circumcised him.</p>

            <p>"She asked to have her son circumcised," Johnson
            said.</p>

            <p>Flatt understood the procedure and didn't raise any
            questions to hospital staff, she said.</p>

            <p>Male circumcision is both a medical procedure and a
            4,000-year-old religious practice sacred to Muslims and
            Jews.</p>

            <p>Circumcising newborns causes virtually no medical
            harm, but offers practically no benefit, either,
            according to a study published January 2000 in the
            journal <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p>

            <p>Circumcision is thought to prevent urinary tract
            infections and penile cancer. But the researchers found
            that for every complication from circumcision, only six
            urinary tract infections are prevented. And for every
            two complications, only one case of penile cancer is
            prevented.</p>

            <p>"There is no medical reason to do it on a routine
            basis," Baer argues. He plans to call national experts
            to support his client's claim.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://research.cirp.org/">foreskin has
            more nerves per square inch</a> than any part of the
            male body, he said.</p>

            <p>If someone believes a child can be affected in
            utero, then circumcision must also influence boys
            because their first penal experience is a painful one,
            Baer said.</p>

            <p>"Whenever you have a painfully traumatic event, it's
            imprinted in the brain," he said.</p>

            <p>Another issue Baer plans to point out is a doctor's
            duty to act in the baby's best interest.</p>

            <p>A baby can't consent to the procedure, and
            circumcision isn't in a baby's best interest, he
            said.</p>

            <p>According to one estimate, 60% of male infants are
            circumcised in the US. Baer estimates 80% to 90% of
            baby boys in North Dakota are circumcised.</p>

            <p>Worldwide, about 85% of men are uncircumcised, Baer
            said. The majority of circumcised men live in the US,
            he said.</p>

            <p>"We are the hotbed for genital mutilation of baby
            boys," Baer said.</p>

            <p>Nine months before the Flatts filed the suit, the
            American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/">statement</a>
            saying the benefits of circumcision weren't significant
            enough to recommend it as a routine procedure.</p>

            <p>Based on cultural, religious and ethnic traditions,
            however, the academy said parents should be given
            complete information about the potential benefits so
            they can make an informed choice.</p>

            <p>In 1996, a federal judge threw out a similar lawsuit
            Baer filed in US District Court, and the Eighth Circuit
            Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal.</p>

            <p>The district case differs from the federal case
            because it asks for financial damages for the procedure
            performed on the boy, where the federal lawsuit only
            wanted a ruling against the state law.</p>

            <p>Since her son's birth, Flatt has begun working as a
            lawyer for Baer in his Hawley office. Her husband was
            killed in a pickup accident last year.</p>

            <p>East Central District Judge <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/Rothe-Seeger.htm"
             target="_blank">Cynthia Rothe-Seeger</a> will preside
            over the case after Judge Georgia Dawson stepped down
            from the case. Dawson's husband sits on the hospital's
            board of directors.</p>

            <p>At today's hearing, Baer hopes Rothe-Seeger allows
            lawyers to question potential jurors individually about
            views and family history on circumcision.</p>

            <p>"This is not an easy issue to talk about," Baer
            said. "Most people don't talk about the condition of
            their penis. It is a taboo subject. As long as it's
            kept taboo, we won't get beyond the barbarism."</p>
