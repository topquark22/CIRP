            <h2>Law vs tradition in circumcision debacle</h2>

            <p>Capetown, South Africa, 8 December 2003</p>

            <p>Amid a new wave of circumcision deaths and arrests,
            Eastern Cape traditional leaders continue to reject the
            province's clampdown on illegal circumcision
            schools.</p>

            <p>Bisho's <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/department_overview.asp?departmentID=4&amp;menuid=204&amp;mainmenuid=21"
            target="_blank">department of health</a> says seven
            youths have died in the past three weeks as a result of
            botched circumcisions; since the beginning of the year
            <span class="yellow">16 youths have had to have their
            genitals amputated.</span></p>

            <p>The latest <span class="yellow">death</span>,
            according to department spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo, was
            in Umtata at the weekend, where a youth died of
            dehydration and ill-treatment -- ironically at a school
            licensed by the department.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">The department has also in the
            last week "rescued" and hospitalised 97 youths from
            illegal schools in Pondoland and the Umtata
            area.</span></p>

            <p>Police working with the department have arrested 30
            <i>iincibi</i>, or traditional surgeons, and
            traditional nurses so far this year for operating
            without permission.</p>

            <p>However, the head of the Congress of Traditional
            Leaders of South Africa (Contralesa) in the province,
            Mwelo Nonkonyana, said on Monday that chiefs are
            "extremely unhappy" over the way the province is
            dealing with the issue.</p>

            <p>Traditional leaders still hold that the Eastern
            Cape's legislation on circumcision, passed in 2001, is
            out of line with the <a
            href="http://www.gov.za/constitution/1996/96cons2.htm"
            target="_blank">Bill of Rights</a>.</p>

            <p>"We regard that act as unconstitutional because it
            infringes on the rights of traditional communities," he
            said.</p>

            <p>"The involvement of men who are not circumcised
            themselves, as well as females merely because they are
            officials of the <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/department_overview.asp?departmentID=4&amp;menuid=204&amp;mainmenuid=21"
            target="_blank">department of health</a>, actually is
            an affront to our own culture."</p>

            <p>The <a
            href="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/323/7321/1090/b"
             target="_blank">Application of Health Standards in
            Traditional Circumcision Act</a> says traditional
            practitioners who perform the operation must have the
            permission of a medical officer, who must also license
            each circumcision school.</p>

            <p>The Act, which provides for fines of up to R10 000,
            or 10 years in jail, also allows for schools to be
            inspected by department officials.</p>

            <p>Nkonyana said Contralesa believes this allows women
            and uncircumcised men to meddle in the ritual.</p>

            <p>If an uncircumcised man is found near an initiation
            school "they will detain that person and circumcise
            him", he said.</p>

            <p>The problem with women is compounded by the belief
            in witchcraft, a fear fed by the fact that women have
            been found naked in the area of circumcision
            schools.</p>

            <p>Traditionally such a woman would be killed "but
            because of the human rights thing she's detained and
            she's dealt with in [another] way by the people".</p>

            <p>Male circumcision is beyond doubt a male issue, he
            said, just as female initiation rituals are a matter
            for women.</p>

            <p>This week his eldest daughter is turning 21, and she
            has been undergoing a Pondo initiation.</p>

            <p>"Even myself, though I'm a chief, I'll be beaten by
            the women if I'm found there."</p>

            <p>Nonkonyana, who has in the past said he is prepared
            to go to jail rather than comply with the Act, said
            that when his eldest son and a group of 13 other youths
            were circumcised earlier this year, they did so at an
            unregistered school at the Pondo Great Place.</p>

            <p>The actual circumcisions were carried out by a
            doctor with Western medical qualifications, who had
            himself been circumcised.</p>

            <p>The boys all came back from the school healthy.</p>

            <p>"We were trying to prove a point," Nonkonyana
            said.</p>

            <p>He said the department's practice of closing down
            illegal schools and sending the youths to hospitals
            meant those boys would be stigmatised for life for not
            completing the ritual.</p>

            <p>"If you are not circumcised through custom in the
            mountain, you are not regarded as a man; [you are] a
            social outcast of a type.</p>

            <p>"They call them <i>abadlezana</i>, which means a
            woman who gives birth in a hospital ward. In other
            words, he is not a man, he is the equivalent of a
            woman.</p>

            <p>"If you start, you must finish. You cannot go out
            unless you are finished."</p>

            <p>He said the provincial government needs to
            strengthen traditional structures, support the tribal
            elders who are custodians of the ritual, and respect
            traditional leaders themselves.</p>

            <p>"Now that the government has disapproved [of] us
            participating, every Tom, Dick and Harry is
            administering it. That is the whole point why people
            are dying," he said.</p>

            <p>He called for an indaba with Eastern Cape provincial
            minister of health <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/department_ministry.asp?contactID=16&amp;departmentID=4"
             target="_blank">Bevan Goqwana</a>, aimed at putting
            the ritual back in the hands of its proper
            custodians.</p>

            <p>"We are saying, let's sit around [to talk]. We are
            not opposed to the idea of having proper legislation,
            to regulate this thing properly."</p>

            <p>Department spokesperson Kupelo said the department
            has no intention of interfering with traditional
            customs, and is merely trying to prevent unnecessary
            deaths, of which there have been more than 250 since
            1995.</p>

            <p>"We don't have to fight. We want chiefs to come on
            board and work with us," he said.</p>

            <p>The department has no regrets about closing illegal
            schools, and will continue doing so until the end of
            the current initiation season.</p>

            <p>"We want them [traditional leaders] to take care of
            their customs, but <span class="yellow">we can't sit
            back and relax while people are dying.</span>" --
