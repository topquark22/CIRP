      <h2>Botched circumcisions: 52 in hospital</h2>

      <p>Queenstown - At least 52 initiates were receiving
      treatment for circumcision complications in hospitals in the
      Eastern Cape, hospital officials said on Monday.</p>

      <p>At Hewu Hospital in Whittlesea, 20 young men were being
      treated, while Cecilia Makiwane Hospital (CMH) in Mdantsane
      was treating 17.</p>

      <p>One of the boys was still in the intensive care unit at
      CMH on Monday, while the others there were reported to be in
      a stable condition.</p>

      <p>Cofimvaba Hospital had seven initiates and four others
      were being treated at Frontier Hospital in Queenstown.</p>

      <p>There are three initiates in the Stutterheim hospital and
      one in Cala Hospital.</p>

      <p>One of the three initiates in the Stutterheim hospital
      would undergo a skin graft soon because his penis had been
      badly circumcised. The other two were reported to be in a
      stable condition.</p>

      <p>Last week 10 initiates, who were in a "terrible
      condition", received treatment at the Mount Ayliff Hospital.
      It was not known how many of them were still in hospital.</p>

      <p>Three initiates have died since the start of the summer
      circumcision season.</p>

      <p>All three were from the East London area. They are:
      Mbongeni Willie, 19, of Scenery Park in East London; Mncedisi
      Tshikila, 17, who was pronounced dead on arrival when he was
      brought to CMH; and Nasetali Deki, 16, who died at CMH.</p>

      <p>Last week acting MEC for Health Max Mamase said charges
      would be brought if any boys below the age of 18 were found
      to have been circumcised.</p>
