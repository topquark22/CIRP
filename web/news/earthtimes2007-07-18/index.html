            <h2>Circumcision Atrocity Suit Filed Against Coles
            County Hospital</h2>

            <p>MATTOON, Ill., July 18 /PRNewswire/ -- The day after
            birth on February 15, 2007, an infant at Sarah Bush
            Hospital had a standard circumcision procedure
            performed by Dr. Sherif Malek. However, what should
            have been a forgotten memory for the boy became a
            lifelong nightmare. Due to negligence, Dr. Malek
            severed the entire glans, commonly termed the head, of
            the infant's penis. Today, Jerry A. Latherow of <a
            href="http://www.latherowlaw.com/"
            target="_blank">Latherow Law Office</a> on behalf of
            plaintiffs Boy Doe (the infant) and his mother, Jane
            Doe, filed a complaint for compensation for damages
            against <a href="http://www.sarahbush.org/"
            target="_blank">Sarah Bush Lincoln Health System,
            Inc</a>, 1000 Health Center Drive, Mattoon, IL, and
            Sherif Malek, D.O. in the Circuit Court of Coles
            County, Illinois.<br />
            <br />
             The infant was a healthy seven pound newborn who was
            delivered without complications on February 14, 2007.
            The following day, a routine circumcision was performed
            on the infant by Dr. Malek using a <a
            href="/library/complications/strimling1/">Mogen clamp</a>, a
            metal, hinge-shaped device used during the procedure.
            At the completion of the circumcision, hospital records
            indicated there was significant bleeding. Inspection of
            the penis revealed nearly all of the glans had been
            amputated at the time of the circumcision. Three months
            later, the infant required penile skin transfer surgery
            at the <a href="http://www.uillinois.edu/"
            target="_blank">University of Illinois</a>, with need
            for future procedures, some of which are only
            appropriate at the age of puberty.<br />
            <br />
             According to medical expert witness, Dr. David Zbaraz
            with <a href="http://www.nmh.org/nmh/home.htm"
            target="_blank">Northwestern Memorial Hospital</a> in
            Chicago, who reviewed the Sarah Bush medical records of
            the infant, "The Mogen clamp when used properly cannot
            amputate a male infant's glans. The injury to this boy
            was completely preventable."<br />
            <br />
             Across the United States major settlements have been
            made for botched circumcisions. <a
            href="/news/1991.03.12_Atlanta_lawsuit/">In 1991, a
            hospital in Atlanta, GA, agreed to pay $22.8 million
            because of negligence during a circumcision</a>. <a
            href="/news/1995.11.22_Mohel-lawsuit/">Also in New York
            City a boy received $1.2 million for a circumcision
            error</a>, and <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/1986.05.28_lawsuit/">in
            Lake Charles, LA a family received $2.75 million after
            a boy's penis was burned during a routine
            circumcision</a>.<br />
            <br />
             "Through simple carelessness at Sarah Bush Hospital, a
            boy will face physical disfigurement and psychological
            trauma throughout his life," said Jerry A. Latherow,
            the attorney representing Boy Doe and Jane Doe,
            "Unfortunately, caps on medical malpractice cases in
            Illinois will prevent the boy from recovering more than
            $500,000 against the physician for the lifelong
            deformity and urological care, and any associated
            psychological problems. Sadly, the hospital's liability
            for such damages is capped at $1 million. Even before
            the case is tried, a mother and her child have been
            robbed."<br />
