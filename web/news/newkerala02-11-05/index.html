            <p>[World News]: KATHMANDU, Nepal, Feb. 11 : A
            5-year-old boy has died in Nepal, and his 7-year-old
            brother is in serious condition, after both were
            circumcised as part of a religious tradition.</p>

            <p>Muyoddin Khan died from loss of blood Thursday after
            undergoing a ritual circumcision in the town of
            Indrapur, the Nepali Web site Kantipur Online reported
            Friday.</p>

            <p>His brother Santalat was hospitalized due to excess
            bleeding after the operation was performed. Doctors
            said he was in serious condition.</p>

            <p>"We carried out circumcision on the boys as part of
            our religion, but the bleeding did not stop," said
            Rahamadtulla, the boys' father. His eldest son died
            under similar circumstances five years ago, and the
            father said his 7-month-old son will also have to
            undergo the procedure.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">"I can't go against our
            religion, although I've lost two of my sons,"</span>
            the report quoted Rahamadtulla as saying.</p>
