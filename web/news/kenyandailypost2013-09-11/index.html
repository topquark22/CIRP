            <h2>Big Blow as circumcision of LUO MEN fails to reduce
            HIV/AIDS infections in Nyanza</h2>

            <p><b>Wednesday September 11, 2013 -</b> The new survey
            released by Health Cabinet Secretary, James Macharia
            yesterday, indicates that the prevalence of HIV/AIDS
            rose in Nyanza and Central Provinces.</p>

            <p>This is a big blow to the efforts and intiatives
            that have been put forth of circumcising Luo men to
            reduce the new HIV infections.</p>

            <p>The Ministry of Health and other NGOs have in the
            recent past mounted agressive campaigns including free
            incentives and cash rewards to Luo men to woo them to
            undergo voluntary circumcision as a strategy to reduce
            HIV infections in Nyanza.</p>

            <p>However, according to the new survey, the efforts
            seem to have exacerbated the situation as HIV infection
            increased from the previous 14.9% to 15.1%.</p>

            <p>The increase in prevalence is alluded to the
            ignorance of Luo men who think they can't contract HIV
            after being circumcised, a notion that drives many to
            be sexually lose [sic].</p>

            <p>The survey also indicates that the prevalence in
            Nyanza province alone is big enough to double the
            national average prevalence.</p>

            <p>In Central Province, the prevalence increased from
            3.5% to 3.8%.</p>
