            <p><b><font color="#999999">Circumcision is often
            unnecessary, damaging and performed without consent,
            says our correspondent</font></b></p>

            <p>THERE IS ONE OPERATION being carried out on
            thousands of British children by NHS doctors without
            any clinical need---and without the patient's consent.
            This procedure has an irreversible physical effect, yet
            there has been minimal public debate about the extent
            to which it is being performed.</p>

            <p>The procedure is non-religious circumcision, carried
            out on "therapeutic" grounds on 4 to 6 per cent of boys
            under 15. Increasingly, the expert consensus is that
            most non-religious circumcisions are carried out for
            reasons of family history, medical myth and
            professional laziness. Some campaigners claim that as
            many as five in six of these circumcisions are
            unnecessary and potentially traumatising.</p>

            <p>Circumcision has become the subject of bitter debate
            in the US, where 80 per cent of men are circumcised. <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a> is
            one of a range of groups challenging the medical
            orthodoxy of circumcision at birth; their campaign has
            been buoyed by a <a
            href="/library/statements/ama2000/">statement</a> from
            the <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/">American Medical
            Association</a> that there is insufficient evidence of
            benefit to recommend routine neonatal circumcision.</p>

            <p>Here, the <a
            href="http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/__Home_Public"
             target="_blank">British Medical Association</a> is
            reviewing its guidelines and is due to announce its
            findings in March; current <a
            href="/library/statements/bma/"
            target="_blank">guidance</a> makes it clear that it is
            unethical to circumcise for therapeutic reasons where
            research shows that less invasive techniques are
            available.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.norm-uk.org/"
            target="_blank">Norm-UK</a>, an organisation which
            campaigns against circumcision, estimates that fewer
            than 1 per cent of boys require the operation, and that
            most of those performed on the NHS are unnecessary. <a
            href="http://www.specialistinfo.com/consget.php?con=warrchec01"
             target="_blank">Dr John Warren</a>, a consultant
            physician and founder of Norm-UK, says that the main
            problem is that GPs and general surgeons are unaware of
            research indicating when circumcision is medically
            required. Specialist paediatric urological surgeons are
            better informed, but not all children are seen by these
            experts.</p>

            <p>Most non-religious circumcisions are performed on
            children whose parents are concerned about a tight
            foreskin that will not retract, a condition known as
            phimosis. "They think there is something wrong, even if
            it's causing the child no problems," says Warren, who
            works at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow,
            Essex. Yet research published as long ago as 1968
            showed that 90 per cent of tight foreskins had resolved
            themselves by the age of four, and 99 per cent had
            developed normally by 17. "The message never filtered
            through, and a lot of people didn't accept it," says
            Warren.</p>

            <p>Family tradition also plays a part. Fathers and
            grandfathers who were circumcised may want their boys
            circumcised too (often on the basis that it is
            "cleaner"), and use the possibility of phimosis to get
            doctors to perform the procedure. Duncan Wilcox,
            consultant paediatric urologist at <a
            href="http://www.ich.ucl.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Great
            Ormond Street Hospital</a> and <a
            href="http://www.hospital.org.uk/"
            target="_blank">Guy's Hospital</a> in London, believes
            that this is the main reason why so many circumcisions
            are carried out unnecessarily.</p>

            <p>"As many as half of the parents who come to see me
            want their child to have a circumcision," he says. "But
            when I tell them that there is a risk, as with all
            operations, the majority are happy to wait and see if
            the foreskin retracts normally. Doctors are certainly
            pressurised, and there is always the occasional parent
            who will get through with pure persistence, or by
            saying that their child keeps getting infections." The
            issue would be less important if foreskin removal did
            not have physical and social implications which carry
            on into adulthood.</p>

            <p>Alex was circumcised at 25 during an operation to
            correct a bend in his penis. The surgeon
            decided---without Alex's consent---to remove the
            foreskin, an action that other surgeons have
            subsequently confirmed as unnecessary. "There was a
            huge reduction in erogenous tissue," says Alex, now 29,
            a systems analyst from Oxfordshire. "The feeling of
            pleasure has changed so much that I haven't been able
            to achieve orgasm since the operation. It had a
            disastrous effect on my relationship: my partner
            wondered whether it was her fault, and that contributed
            to the end of our relationship. Since then I've found
            it hard to get into a new relationship.</p>

            <p>"I am conscious of how I look, and girlfriends have
            given me quizzical looks. They are not used to seeing
            circumcised men. I haven't had the confidence to go
            into a public changing room since the operation." The
            foreskin contains a rich variety and concentration of
            specialised nerve receptors. In May 2002, a <a
            href="/library/sex_function/fink1/">study</a> in the
            <i>British Journal of Urology</i> reported that
            circumcision appears to result in decreased erectile
            function and penile sensitivity: 38 per cent of men
            circumcised as adults reported harm to sexual
            function.</p>

            <p>The practice of medical (as distinct from religious)
            circumcision began in <a
            href="/library/history/moscucci/">Victorian times</a>
            as a deterrent to masturbation, then thought to be the
            cause of insanity, epilepsy, hysteria, tuberculosis,
            short-sightedness and death. The practice became
            popular in the 1920s for reasons of hygiene and peaked
            in the 1940s. In 1949, researchers began to question
            whether a nonretracting foreskin was abnormal, and
            numbers have declined.</p>

            <p>Norm-UK has received hundreds of calls from men who
            feel ashamed or mutilated by the procedure. For young
            boys, the potential embarrassment of having a penis
            that looks different from those of their friends is
            obvious. Yet the psychological issues are complex: in a
            largely Jewish or Islamic community, this argument
            works as much in favour of circumcision as against it.
            Dr Lotte Newman, a former president of the <a
            href="http://www.rcgp.org.uk/" target="_blank">Royal
            College of General Practitioners</a> who chairs the
            circumcision working party of the <a
            href="http://www.bod.org.uk/" target="_blank">Board of
            Deputies of British Jews</a>, is troubled by <a
            href="/news/radiosweden10-01-01/">developments</a> in
            Sweden which may lead to a ban on child circumcision
            there. "The trend against circumcision affects those
            religions which practise it traditionally," she
            says.</p>

            <p>Such sensitivities may account for the neutral
            stance of mainstream medical organisations such as the
            <a href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/"
            target="_blank">General Medical Council</a>, which
            states only that its soundings "demonstrated widely
            conflicting views in society, which neither doctors nor
            the GMC can resolve."</p>

            <p>But perhaps the issue ultimately comes down to one
            of consent. Adults need to know about the alternatives
            to have an accurate basis for decision-making. But
            Norm-UK's concern is that no one should consent to a
            circumcision on someone else's behalf, even if it is
            their own child. That means doing everything possible
            to treat conditions non-invasively until the patient
            can make an informed choice.</p>

            <p>"When I was a kid I had a circumcision and my
            brother didn't," says Warren. "It made me conscious of
            the issue as a medical student. Then I had to conduct
            the operation myself, and was horrified at what I was
            doing. I thought, one day I will stop this ridiculous
            practice."</p>
