            <h2>MoEY receives complaint against private school</h2>
            By Mohsen Rashed and Meraj Rizvi 

            <p>19 March 2004</p>

            <p>DUBAI - The Foreign Private Schools Section at the
            <a href="http://education.gov.ae/"
            target="_blank">Ministry of Education and Youth</a>
            (MoEY) has recently received a complaint from the
            parents of a four-year old student who was subjected to
            genital tests, which led to bleeding of the
            reproductive organ.</p>

            <p>The father explained in his written complaint to the
            ministry that the management of the school, which is an
            affiliate to a private-school group, sent the medical
            examination form to him to fill in, indicating that it
            is a routine procedure where a urine sample is
            taken..</p>

            <p>"No other details were mentioned about the test, nor
            was I invited to attend. However, the results were
            forwarded to me with my son saying they are normal,"
            said the father..</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">The father later found his son
            suffering serious pain in his organ.</span></p>

            <p><span class="yellow">The child explained that the
            attending physician violently pulled him while taking
            the sample and he later bled.</span> Having enquired
            with the nurse, who works for a medical clinic
            affiliated to the same group, the father found out that
            she was not present at the time of taking the
            sample..</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">"The family doctor confirmed
            that my son is suffering from a ruptured foreskin as a
            result of the test, especially after my son had
            explained in detail what had been done to him," the
            parent said.</span></p>

            <p>"The principal, who had initially no answer, and
            made no offer to help, attributed the bleeding due to
            my son's falling down in the school playground," he
            added..</p>

            <p>However, the head of the medical care section of the
            private clinic informed that the incident is being
            investigated, <span class="yellow">and the physician
            who had carried out the test is suspended.</span></p>

            <p>Following the incident, the father withdrew his son
            from the school, and filed a complaint with the
            ministry. On its part, the MoEY formed a special
            committee that paid an immediate visit to the
            school.</p>

            <p>The school administration has denied the contents of
            the complaint. However the investigations are still
            underway.</p>

            <p>A source at the school disclosed that all the
            school's medical tests and examinations have been
            stopped temporarily.</p>

            <p>The Chief Operating Officer of the private school
            group when contacted, did not deny the incident. He
            said, the nature of the issue has been discussed with
            both the parents as well as the MoEY officials..</p>

            <p>"The school has maintained a dialogue with the
            parents and has explained the nature of the health
            examination conducted on the child."</p>

            <p>The official explained that the health examination
            of students is a routine examination conducted in all
            private schools under the guidelines of the MoEY and
            the <a href="http://www.uae.gov.ae/moh/index.html"
            target="_blank">Ministry of Health</a>.</p>

            <p>In this case also, the health examination was
            carried out under the supervision of a qualified doctor
            and a nurse appointed by the school, as per the
            ministry directives, the official said, stating further
            that the parents were advised in advance through a form
            explaining in detail about the health examination to be
            carried out on their child.</p>

            <p>"In addition to a list of things explained in the
            form, a bottle for urine sample was also requested to
            be sent along with the student as part of the health
            examination.</p>

            <p>The parents were not kept in the dark, and only
            after the form was duly signed and returned, the health
            examination was conducted on the four-year old
            student."</p>

            <p>He pointed out that the school adheres to
            appropriate guidelines in carrying out such examination
            on students. However, he believes that this particular
            incident, "is an issue of confidentiality between the
            school and the parents."</p>

            <p>He clarified that other parents of students from the
            same school, have so far voiced no complaints against
            the system and are happy with the procedures applied in
            the school with regards to its health and immunisation
            campaigns.</p>

            <p>It was learnt that the school has not carried out
            immunisation campaign for two years, but has been
            conducting health examinations according to the
            Ministry guidelines.</p>
