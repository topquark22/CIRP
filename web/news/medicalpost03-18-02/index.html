            <h4>MDs should know they can refuse to perform
            procedure</h4>

            <p>By Deana Driver</p>

            <p>Regina - Saskatchewan's <a
            href="http://www.quadrant.net/cpss/"
            target="_blank">College of Physicians and Surgeons</a>
            wants doctors to reduce the province's high rate of
            circumcisions.</p>

            <p>If a procedure has shown little evidence of expected
            benefit and there's a recognized risk of surgical
            complications, "it would generally be considered
            imprudent if not improper for a surgeon to perform such
            a surgical procedure," said a <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/sask2002/">
            memo</a> to physicians from the college registrar, Dr.
            Dennis Kendel.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.cps.ca/">Canadian Pediatric
            Society</a> has cautioned against routine circumcision
            for the past <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/cps1975/">25
            years</a>, but that has not drastically affected the
            rate of circumcision in Saskatchewan where 27.6% of
            newborn males were circumcised in 2000/01.</p>

            <p>Even though circumcision became a non-insured
            service in 1996, the rate dropped only moderately over
            the past five years, said the memo.</p>

            <p>In contrast, Nova Scotia's rate is 1.5% of male
            infants and Newfoundland/Labrador's rate has dropped to
            0.6%.</p>

            <p>The fact the rate of circumcision remained high
            despite the evidence "generally means the indications
            of optimal surgery are very unclear," said Dr.
            Kendel.</p>

            <p>The college will implement an education program to
            reduce the high rate of circumcisions in the province,
            beginning with Dr. Kendel's memo. It reminds physicians
            they have a duty to inform parents of the risk and lack
            of benefits of the procedure and that they may refuse
            to perform the procedure just as they would other
            requested medical acts they regard to be
            inappropriate.</p>

            <p>"They aren't obligated to carry out a procedure
            simply because parents want it done," said Dr.
            Kendel.</p>

            <p>If religious beliefs are stated as the reason for
            wanting the surgery performed, the physician should
            obtain a parental signature on a consent document
            "which clearly stipulates the circumcision in question
            is not medically indicated and is being performed in
            accordance with parental religious practices. In such
            cases, physicians would be prudent to consult with and
            seek advice from the <a
            href="http://www.cmpa.org/">Canadian Medical Protective
            Association</a> before proceeding," said Dr. Kendel's
            memo.</p>
