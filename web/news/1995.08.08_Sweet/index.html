        <h1>$10,000 REWARD</h1>

        <h3>FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO THE RECOVERY OF THE
        PROVIDENCE HOSPITAL MEDICAL RECORDS OF JACOB SWEET OR
        INFORMATION LEADING TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE PERSON OR
        PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOSS OR DESTRUCTION OF JACOB'S
        RECORDS</h3>
      </center>

      <p>Jacob Sweet was born at PROVIDENCE HOSPITAL in Anchorage
      on January 16, 1986. He was a healthy and normal baby boy. On
      January 17, 1986, Jacob was circumcised by JAMES NESBITT,
      M.D., of THE CHILDREN'S CLINIC. On Saturday, January 25,
      Jacob's parents, Gary and Beverly Sweet, brought Jacob back
      to the emergency room at PROVIDENCE because he was vomiting
      and was fussy and the circumcision side was red and swollen.
      They were met by DANIEL TULIP, M.D., also of THE CHILDREN'S
      CLINIC. DR. TULIP admitted Jacob to the hospital. Late in the
      evening of January 26, Jacob suffered a prolonged seizure or
      "crash" and was transferred to the hospital's neonatal
      intensive care unit at 2:15 a.m. on Monday, January 27.</p>

      <p>Today, Jacob is nine years old and is severely brain
      damaged. He cannot walk, talk or care for himself in any
      respect.</p>

      <p>SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT PORTIONS OF JACOB'S PROVIDENCE
      HOSPITAL MEDICAL RECORDS FOR THE 26-HOUR PERIOD FROM THE TIME
      HE WAS ADMITTED UNTIL THE "CRASH" ARE MISSING.</p>

      <p>The attorneys for the Sweets, listed below, believe that
      there are persons with knowledge of how records may have
      become "lost" and would like to speak to anyone with any
      knowledge regarding Jacob or his "lost" records...</p>

      <p>We understand that you may feel pressured not to come
      forward. All we ask is your complete honesty and your
      assistance in a matter of extreme importance, not only for
      Jacob and his family, but also for the medical care of future
      patients... Payment of all or a portion of the reward is in
      the good faith discretion of Jacob's attorneys who assure you
      that you will be treated fairly.</p>
