            <h2>Monsey rabbi investigated</h2>

            <p>By STEVE LIEBERMAN<br />
             THE JOURNAL NEWS</p>

            <p>(Original publication: February 3, 2005)</p>

            <p>A lawyer for the Monsey Hasidic rabbi suspected of
            transmitting a fatal case of herpes to a baby boy
            during a circumcision said yesterday that the practice
            of suctioning blood orally is thousands of years old
            and integral to the religion.</p>

            <p>But one local scholar said such unsanitized rituals
            actually violated Jewish law. Another rabbi saw the
            case as outsiders frowning on Hasidic traditions.</p>

            <p>Rabbi Yitzchok Fischer is being investigated by New
            York City health officials after a baby died of herpes,
            and two others contracted the disease.</p>

            <p>Fischer, a mohel in Rockland, the metropolitan area
            and Israel, uses his mouth to suck the blood from the
            wound caused by cutting the baby's foreskin. The
            centuries-old ritual, called "metzizah bi peh," is used
            predominantly by Hasidic Jews, who consider the
            practice mandatory for newborns.</p>

            <p>Most other Jewish mohels wear surgical gloves and
            use sterilized instruments. Many other mohels who do
            that part of the ritual use a medical tube to suction
            the blood, several rabbis said yesterday.</p>

            <p>Ritual circumcision, or bris, dates to the prophet
            Abraham and is said to symbolize God's covenant with
            the Jewish people.</p>

            <p>Fischer is not accused of violating any criminal
            laws. The New York City Department of Health and Mental
            Hygiene took civil action under its legal powers to
            protect the health and safety of the children and
            investigate outbreaks of communicable diseases.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/nydailynews02-02-05/"
            target="_blank">After a child died of herpes and two
            others were infected</a>, the city's health
            commissioner ordered Fischer to undergo blood tests for
            herpes and stop using the mouth suction method without
            a tube until the issue was resolved. He continued to
            use the mouth suction method, so court orders were
            sought in December, the city's lawyers wrote in court
            papers.</p>

            <p>Fischer's lawyer, Mark J. Kurzmann, said yesterday
            that the rabbi was cooperating with the city's
            investigation. Kurzmann, whose son, Hillel, also is
            working on the case, declined to say whether the rabbi
            would submit to a blood test, citing medical privacy
            reasons.</p>

            <p>"The source of the children's herpes has not been
            confirmed, and it may have been an unfortunate
            coincidence," Kurzmann said.</p>

            <p>"This is an integral part of the religious practice
            for thousands of years," Kurzmann said. "There have
            been hundreds of thousands of babies who have undergone
            this ritual, and the incidence of herpes is virtually
            nil."</p>

            <p>Fischer, 66, could not be reached for comment at his
            home. Kurzmann said he would speak for the rabbi, who
            was trained in circumcisions by the British Milah
            Society.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">The city health department took
            action after being notified in November that a newborn
            less than three weeks old had died Oct. 26 of herpes
            simplex virus type 1.</span> The infant's twin brother
            tested positive for the infection. Fischer performed
            the double bris on Oct. 16, the city's court papers
            state.</p>

            <p>City health department officials later learned that
            a Staten Island baby also tested positive for herpes
            after being circumcised by the rabbi in late 2003,
            according to the court papers.</p>

            <p>Herpes is far more dangerous to infants than adults
            because of their fragile immune systems. An outbreak of
            a disease is defined in the city's health code as one
            that has been reported in three or more instances.</p>

            <p>"The <a
            href="http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/doh/home.html"
            target="_blank">New York City Department Health and
            Mental Hygiene</a> is concerned that the possible
            transmission of herpes simplex in infants is continuing
            as a result of the ... practice of Metzizah bi peh,"
            city lawyers wrote in court papers dated Dec. 22.</p>

            <p>The mouth-suction ritual during a circumcision is
            not mandated by Jewish law, said <a
            href="http://comsyn.org/rabbi" target="_blank">Rabbi
            Moses Tendler</a>, a professor of ethical medical
            practices and Talmudic law at <a
            href="http://www.yu.edu/" target="_blank">Yeshiva
            University</a>. Tendler, the rabbi of <a
            href="http://comsyn.org/" target="_blank">Community
            Synagogue</a> of Monsey, also serves on the <a
            href="http://www.rabbis.org/"
            target="_blank">Rabbinical Council of America</a>, an
            Orthodox Jewish group.</p>

            <p>Tendler said the unsanitized ritual performed by
            Fischer violated Jewish law. Tendler said the Talmud
            refers to sucking the blood from the wound, but doesn't
            specifically indicate using one's mouth.</p>

            <p>"I protested his use of oral suction as violating
            good medical practices, which he is required to do
            under Jewish law," Tendler said. "Jewish law has
            recognized there has been an increase in knowledge of
            hygiene and medical advances over the centuries. It is
            not a lack of respect for the traditions or Jewish law
            to use a tube."</p>

            <p>Monsey Rabbi David Eidensohn, 62, said the spreading
            of disease is rare through the oral suction method. He
            said his five sons and numerous grandsons, as well as
            hundreds of thousands of newborn boys, had undergone
            the procedure. Fischer, he said, is a respected mohel
            across the region and in Israel.</p>

            <p>"This represents people frowning on our traditions,"
            Eidensohn said. "If this happened regularly or even
            occasionally, we would be the first to stop the
            practice ourselves. We don't want to kill our children.
            This is a tragedy for the families."</p>

            <p>Stanley J. Kogan, chief of pediatric urology at <a
            href="http://montekids.org/" target="_blank">Children's
            Hospital</a> at <a href="http://www.montefiore.org/"
            target="_blank">Montefiore Medical Center</a> in the
            Bronx, has been performing in-hospital circumcisions
            for three decades.</p>

            <p>"In my 30 years of doing circumcisions, I have never
            had a patient develop an infection with genital herpes
            afterward," said Kogan, who has a private practice in
            White Plains and is on staff at <a
            href="http://www.nyackhospital.org/default.htm"
            target="_blank">Nyack Hospital</a>. "<a
            href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/114/2/e259"
             target="_blank">That speaks to just how unusual it
            is</a>."</p>

            <p>Physicians performing circumcisions are careful to
            clean the patient's skin before the incision is made.
            All instruments are sterile, and special care is taken
            to make sure that the tissue is treated gently to
            prevent trauma, he said.</p>

            <p>But occasionally, babies develop complications from
            circumcision, he said.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">"Even in the cleanest operating
            room under the best circumstances, you can get an
            infection," Kogan said. "There is never no risk with
            any surgical procedure."</span></p>
