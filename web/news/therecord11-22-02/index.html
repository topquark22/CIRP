            <p><b>Scots medic jailed for killing two children in
            Africa faces fight to keep working in UK</b></p>

            <p>TWO healthy children died hours after a Scots
            anaesthetist injected them with excessive doses of
            morphine, the <a href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/"
            target="_blank">GMC</a> heard yesterday.</p>

            <p>Richard McGown was jailed in Zimbabwe for the
            culpable homicide of the youngsters.</p>

            <p>But the Edinburgh-educated doctor's return to
            Britain has led to a hearing to stop him practising in
            the UK.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, the GMC was told that McGown's decision
            to discharge a 19-month-old boy 75 minutes after his
            circumcision operation was "wholly indefensible".</p>

            <p>He had also allegedly failed in the post-operative
            care of a nine-year- old girl, when he injected her
            with morphine after her appendix was removed.</p>

            <p>Joanna Glynn, for the GMC, said: "Neither of these
            two healthy children should have died. Both deaths were
            preventable. This was caused by culpable failures."</p>

            <p>McGown was jailed in January 1995 for the culpable
            homicide of the two children, after a court ruled he
            had negligently administered morphine.</p>

            <p>The case sparked racial tensions among Zimbabwe's
            100,000 whites and 10million blacks.</p>

            <p>The doctor, who pleaded not guilty, received a
            12-month jail term, of which six months were suspended.
            He was acquitted of three other deaths.</p>

            <p>McGown, who worked for 20 years in Harare, served
            four months in prison before returning to the UK.
            Yesterday's hearing came after demands from leading
            medical and political figures in Zimbabwe.</p>

            <p>Both youngsters died following surgery at the <a
            href="http://www.avclin.co.zw/" target="_blank">Avenues
            Clinic</a> in Harare, where the Scot was working as a
            consultant anaesthetist. He was also a respected author
            of research on administering morphine to young
            children.</p>

            <p><span>In July 1988, the baby boy, known as Patient
            A, died after being given morphine.</span></p>

            <p>The infant had undergone a <span>circumcision</span>
            to cure his urinary problems and was injected by McGown
            to ensure he was free of pain.</p>

            <p>The boy's father, who flew over from Harare, told
            the committee that after the operation McGown handed
            him his son saying: "Here is your child, I've brought
            him back from the dead."</p>

            <p>He said he was not told his son had been given
            morphine and was told to take him home just 75 minutes
            after the procedure.</p>

            <p>The youngster fell into a deep sleep, then vomited a
            "yellow water". <span>He was raced back to hospital but
            died that evening.</span></p>

            <p>In August 1990, McGown injected a high dose of
            opiate into the spine of nine- year-old Lavender
            Khminwe. <span>The young girl died that evening from
            the effects of the morphine.</span></p>

            <p>Her father Charles, a Kenyan lawyer, has vowed to
            fight on for justice for his daughter.</p>

            <p>The anaesthetist admits mistakes in post-operative
            care but he denies the morphine doses were excessive.
            The hearing continues.</p>
