            <h2>Activists Up Efforts To Cut Circumcision Out of
            Bris Ritual</h2>

            <p>by Jacob Victor | Wed. July 18, 2007.</p>

            <p>A few months before his son was born, Thomas Wolfe
            of Wheeling, W.Va., consulted the rabbi of his Reform
            congregation to discuss plans for the baby&rsquo;s
            circumcision. &ldquo;I had the perception that a
            circumcision was just an innocuous procedure, with no
            risk,&rdquo; he later told the Forward. After the rabbi
            had recommended that Wolfe find a ritual circumciser,
            or mohel, to perform the newborn&rsquo;s bris, Wolfe
            did a little Internet research. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t
            really until that time that I became aware of all the
            controversies,&rdquo; he said.<br />
            <br />
             While the United States is one of the few
            industrialized countries in which a majority of newborn
            boys are circumcised, recent surveys show that the
            American circumcision rate, which was close to 90% in
            the 1960s, is now at only 57%. But even though the
            national rate has declined, circumcision remains the
            norm in all major Jewish denominations; most newborn
            Jewish boys have either a tradition brit milah or have
            the procedure performed at a hospital. Nevertheless, a
            small but vocal minority of Jewish activists have begun
            to question the importance, and even the morality, of
            circumcision. Some have even begun using alternative
            &ldquo;bris-less&rdquo; brisses to welcome their sons
            into the world.<br />
            <br />
             The Internet is full of Web sites sponsored by
            circumcision opponents, who often call themselves
            proponents of &ldquo;genital integrity&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;intactivism.&rdquo; After conducting his
            research, Wolfe decided to forgo circumcising his son.
            Instead, he arranged a so-called brit shalom ceremony,
            a newly created ritual that celebrates birth while
            omitting circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             His own son&rsquo;s case behind him, Wolfe is now
            pressing for broader change. This past May, he began
            circulating a petition calling on Reform rabbis and
            congregations to reconsider a 1982 rabbinic edict
            affirming the centrality of circumcision in Reform
            Judaism. As of now, the petition has drawn about 70
            signatories. But despite - or perhaps because of -
            their small numbers, Jewish anti-circumcision activists
            remain vocal in demanding that Jews change the way they
            view circumcision. Mark Reiss, a retired diagnostic
            radiologist, is executive vice president of <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a> and a
            strong advocate of the brit shalom ceremony. Reiss, who
            is a member of a Conservative congregation in San
            Francisco, believes that the time has come for Jews to
            abandon the practice. &ldquo;A lot of scholars feel
            that circumcision was an atavistic cultural remnant
            from the days when pagans sacrificed their boys to the
            gods,&rdquo; he told the <i>Forward</i>. Reiss has been
            active in creating a database of rabbis and laypeople
            who will officiate at brit shalom ceremonies. There are
            no restrictions on the content of the ceremony,
            according to Reiss. Some parents simply use it as a
            naming ceremony, some celebrate the
            &ldquo;intactness&rdquo; of their child and some design
            versions all their own.<br />
            <br />
             Moshe Rothenberg of Brooklyn officiates at around six
            or seven brit shalom ceremonies a year. He preserves
            many of the traditional aspects of the bris, including
            a blessing over wine, a festive meal and a sandak (a
            person close the family designated to hold the newborn
            during the ceremony). Instead of a circumcision,
            however, Rothenberg incorporates unconventional
            rituals. &ldquo;One time we gathered stones and cast
            them into water to remember all the living people in
            the child&rsquo;s life in one bowl and all the people
            who aren&rsquo;t there in another bowl,&rdquo;
            Rothenberg told the <i>Forward</i>. &ldquo;Sometimes we
            do a ritual involving nature, often consecrating a
            plant or tree on behalf of the baby.&rdquo; At the brit
            shalom of his own son, Rothenberg retold the biblical
            story of Abraham and Sarah welcoming angels disguised
            as travelers into their home. It was these angels who
            told Sarah she would give birth to Isaac. After the
            story was told, the baby&rsquo;s feet were washed. This
            symbolically linked him to Abraham and Sarah, who
            washed their guests&rsquo; feet as a sign of
            hospitality and respect.<br />
            <br />
             Many brit shalom proponents have based their stance on
            medical grounds. Reiss and other anti-circumcision
            activists claim that there are several medical reasons
            to abandon the practice. These include the possible
            pain experienced by a child during the procedure, the
            risk of infection and the theory that the foreskin
            provides sexual sensation that circumcised men can
            never experience. Reiss also argues that many of the
            perceived benefits of circumcision are in fact
            spurious. &ldquo;Circumcision has always been related
            to whatever the disease of the decade was,&rdquo; he
            said.<br />
            <br />
             For some doctors, however, recent studies showing that
            circumcised heterosexual African men are around half as
            likely as their uncircumcised counterparts to contract
            HIV simply back up what they have claimed all along:
            that circumcision is not only harmless but also
            beneficial. Edgar Schoen, a pediatric endocrinologist
            who was the chair of the 1989 American Academy of
            Pediatrics&rsquo; Task Force on Circumcision, claims
            that there at least 10 known medical benefits provided
            by circumcision. For example, there is some evidence
            that circumcision decreases the risk of infant kidney
            infection early in life and helps prevent the spread of
            sexually transmitted diseases.<br />
            <br />
             Still, the <a
            href="/library/statements/aap1999/">official
            position</a> of the 1999 American Academy of
            Pediatrics&rsquo; Task Force on Circumcision is
            equivocal: &ldquo;Existing scientific evidence
            demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male
            circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to
            recommend routine neonatal circumcision.&rdquo; Schoen
            argues that this decision was reached because of the
            influence of what he calls &ldquo;anti-circ&rdquo;
            activists. &ldquo;These people are very good with the
            sound bites, and they get on all the talk shows and all
            over the Internet,&rdquo; he said, adding that such
            activists are especially effective in convincing young
            liberal Jews not to circumcise their sons. &ldquo;For
            young, trendy Jewish parents, everything has to be
            natural and organic. &lsquo;Why would the foreskin be
            there if it wasn&rsquo;t good?&rsquo; That resonates
            with a lot of young Jewish parents.&rdquo;<br />
            <br />
             Jewish critics of circumcision have not limited their
            arguments to the medical realm, with some contending
            that the central issue is one of volition. Eli
            Ungar-Sargon, a Chicago-based filmmaker, recently
            released the documentary &ldquo;Cut,&rdquo; an
            exploration of circumcision from religious, scientific
            and ethical perspectives. Ungar-Sargon, who was raised
            Orthodox but no longer identifies with a specific
            denomination, told the <i>Forward</i> that he views
            circumcision &ldquo;as gross violation of human
            rights.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I think the real central
            ethical issue here is one of autonomy. Do we have the
            right to permanently alter another person&rsquo;s body
            without their permission?&rdquo;<br />
            <br />
             At the end of the day, every couple has to make its
            own decision, said Rabbi Donni Aaron, head of program
            designed to train Reform mohels. But, she added, most
            of the parents she has encountered eventually choose to
            circumcise their sons, and that trend is unlikely to
            change any time soon. &ldquo;If for thousands of years
            it was clear that the practice was harmful,&rdquo; she
            said, &ldquo;it would have gone away a while
            ago.&rdquo;</p>
