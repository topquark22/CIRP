            <h2>Initiation deaths: new fears over missing boy</h2>

            <p>June 30 2002 at 11:57PM</p>

            <p>Another boy is feared dead at a traditional
            initiation school near Heidelberg on the East Rand,
            with police expected to launch a search for the child
            on Monday.</p>

            <p>Police spokesperson Annaline Prinsloo said a
            17-year-old boy who escaped from the initiation school
            on Monday discovered that the boy sleeping next to him
            was dead.</p>

            <p>She said the police and emergency services officials
            then visited the school to investigate.</p>

            <p>While no body was found, Prinsloo said two of the 16
            children had septic circumcision wounds and several
            others had pneumonia. The children were treated on the
            scene.</p>

            <p><b>Denied the police permission to remove the sick
            children</b></p>

            <p>The "teachers" denied the police permission to
            remove the sick children from the school, while some of
            the children refused to leave.</p>

            <p>Health authorities were then informed and Prinsloo
            said the school would be closed down on Monday and the
            children sent home.</p>

            <p>She said the 17-year-old who escaped from the
            initiation camp was taken to Heidelberg Hospital and
            treated for injuries before being sent home to
            Vereeniging.</p>

            <p>The imminent closure of the school comes a week
            after five boys died at traditional initiation schools
            in the Heidelberg area after allegedly being severely
            beaten and exposed to adverse weather.</p>
