            <h3>Five-week-old infant died after he was circumcised
            at Penticton hospital</h3>

            <p><b>Jason Proctor</b><br />
            The Province</p>

            <p>Thursday, August 29, 2002.</p>

            <p>The Kamloops coroner is investigating the case of an
            infant who died last week from complications following
            his circumcision at Penticton Regional Hospital.</p>

            <p>The five-week-old child was released after the
            procedure last Tuesday morning, but his parents went
            back to talk to the doctor later that day with concerns
            about bleeding. They returned home, but the situation
            worsened overnight, forcing them to rush the child back
            to hospital early Wednesday.</p>

            <p>The infant was flown by air ambulance to Vancouver,
            where he died last Thursday in <a
            href="http://www.cw.bc.ca/index.asp"
            target="_blank">B.C. Children's Hospital</a>.</p>

            <p>"It certainly seems to be unusual," coroner Ian
            McKichan said yesterday. "It's definitely something
            that warrants an investigation, because it's a totally
            unexpected sort of death."</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/1993.06.21_death/">Deaths
            following circumcision are almost unheard of</a>, but
            like any operation, bleeding and infection are the
            greatest dangers.</p>

            <p>The case raises questions about an increasingly rare
            operation which stirs controversy in some circles.</p>

            <p>"The bottom line is that circumcision is becoming a
            less-common procedure," said Dr. Morris Van Andel,
            registrar of the <a href="http://www.cpsbc.bc.ca/"
            target="_blank">College of Physicians and Surgeons of
            B.C.</a> "It's no longer an insured service -- it's
            considered an option. That makes it all the more
            distressing when you hear about something like
            this."</p>

            <p>According to Penticton hospital officials, the
            operation to remove the foreskin from the child's penis
            was conducted by a physician with 16 years' practice in
            British Columbia.</p>

            <p>The coroner's office is now awaiting the results of
            an autopsy being performed in Vancouver. McKichan said
            the investigation could take up to three months.</p>

            <p>The college will likely also investigate the case
            after the coroner's inquiry is finished, to determine
            whether the death is the result of medical
            complications or malpractice.</p>

            <p>Decades ago, nearly all Canadian boys were
            circumcised shortly after birth, but the <a
            href="http://www.cps.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian
            Paediatric Society</a> no longer recommends the
            procedure. It is now done mainly on religious grounds
            -- primarily by Jews and Muslims.</p>

            <p>Because of the <a
            href="/library/statistics/Canada/BC/">drop in
            popularity</a> and increasing medical cost-cutting,
            children are usually circumcised at a doctor's office
            or as hospital out-patients.</p>

            <p>Doctors generally observe a child for about an hour,
            and then instruct parents to watch for trouble.</p>

            <p>"Instead of being observed by professional staff,
            the parents are left on their own," said Dr. Shelley
            Ross, a Burnaby family doctor. "If a person wants to
            get it done, should they be pushed into not having
            professional observation because of the cost?"</p>

            <p>Doctors say the best time to perform a circumcision
            is in the first few weeks after birth.</p>

            <p>The operation should take 10 to 15 minutes under a
            local anesthetic, performed with a clamp designed to
            seal the blood-vessels.</p>

            <p>"The amount of blood you should see with this type
            of procedure, should be no more than a [bit] on the
            diaper," said Ross.</p>

            <p>"You need experienced hands. You need to to know
            what you're doing."</p>
