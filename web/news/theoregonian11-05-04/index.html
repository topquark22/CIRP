            <p>VANCOUVER -- A Ridgefield man accused of trying to
            circumcise his 8-year-old son in the bathtub is
            competent to stand trial.</p>

            <p>Edwin B. Baxter, 33, was found competent after a
            mental health evaluation requested in late September by
            his attorney, Anthony J. Lowe.</p>

            <p>Baxter was arrested Sept. 3 and faces an accusation
            of second-degree assault of a child/domestic violence.
            His bail is set at $50,000.</p>

            <p>In a hearing Thursday, Clark County Superior Court
            <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/courts/superior/judges.html"
            target="_blank">Judge James E. Rulli</a> read portions
            of a report that said Baxter had low self-esteem and
            low impulse control but that he had no mental
            defect.</p>

            <p>Baxter understands the charge against him and will
            be able to assist his attorney in his defense, the
            report said.</p>

            <p>Lowe told the court he is considering whether to
            pursue a defense of diminished capacity.</p>

            <p>Rulli will set a trial date on Monday. Baxter's
            trial had been scheduled to start Monday but was
            postponed to allow for the mental evaluation.</p>
