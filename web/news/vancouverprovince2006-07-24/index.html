            <h2>Coquitlam man's circumcision reversed</h2>

            <h4>Procedure originally done by priests as
            punishment</h4>

            <p>Yumimi Pang; With a file from David Carrigg, <i>The
            Province</i><br />
             Published: Monday, July 24, 2006</p>

            <p>A Coquitlam man who suffered for decades because of
            a botched circumcision has had his foreskin restored,
            thanks to B.C. taxpayers.</p>

            <p>Paul Tinari said that, since his surgery in May,
            he's out of pain and enjoying sex in ways he never
            could before. "It worked out really, really well," he
            said. "It's totally functional. It works better."</p>

            <p>Tinari, 48, is one of the first men in Canada to
            have the government pick up the tab for this surgery.
            The <a
            href="http://www.gov.bc.ca/bvprd/bc/channel.do?action=ministry&amp;channelID=-8387&amp;navId=NAV_ID_province"
             target="_blank">B.C. Health Ministry</a> paid for 90
            per cent of his $12,000 bill and Tinari hopes it will
            set a precedent for other men.</p>

            <p>"I really wanted them to cover [my surgery] and it
            would be preferable if they would cover other people,
            as well," he said.</p>

            <p>Foreskin reconstruction had been a lifelong quest
            for Tinari, who told <i>The Province</i> he was
            circumcised at age eight by priests at a Montreal
            boarding school as punishment for masturbating.</p>

            <p>In Victorian times, some physicians believed
            amputation of the foreskin was a way to prevent the
            "ills of masturbation."</p>

            <p>"It was on a desk," said Tinari, describing how he
            was held down to perform the procedure without pain
            medication.</p>

            <p>"They removed so much skin, there was not enough to
            accommodate an erection," said Tinari, who has since
            become an advocate for banning non-consensual
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>As a kid, he thought erections were meant to be
            painful "as a punishment from God."</p>

            <p>Tinari also suffered chronic skin infections and
            said intercourse was painful at times.</p>

            <p>Tinari, who is an avid runner, would even get salt
            burns on his penis as a result of sweat.</p>

            <p>"Every single day, I was in pain and this was
            totally unnecessary," he said, adding that other men he
            talked to had similar problems.</p>

            <p>Tinari, who holds a PhD in engineering, decided to
            become an expert. He researched circumcision for 30
            years and considered foreskin restoration, but the cost
            stood in his way.</p>

            <p>Then Tinari found the backing of health
            professionals. His psychologist said he would benefit
            and his urologist called his circumcision "one of the
            worst" he'd ever seen.</p>

            <p>Tinari discovered Toronto plastic surgeon <a
            href="http://www.psurg.com/DR.htm" target="_blank">Dr.
            Robert Stubbs</a>, whose work on genitalia is widely
            recognized.</p>

            <p>"There is no specific fee code in the [Medical
            Services Plan] billing system for this type of
            procedure," said a Health Ministry official. "In rare
            and extenuating circumstances, the ministry may provide
            coverage."</p>

            <p>Tinari's surgery was a two-part procedure and he
            spent about four weeks recovering.</p>

            <p>He said that surgery has improved his sex life, he
            is no longer irritated by his clothing and running is
            more comfortable.</p>

            <p>"I heartily encourage other men who are unhappy with
            their circumcisions to go ahead and do this the way I
            did," said Tinari.</p>
