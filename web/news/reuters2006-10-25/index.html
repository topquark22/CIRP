            <h2>Judge rules 9-year-old need not get
            circumcised</h2>

            <p>CHICAGO (Reuters) - In a decision cheered by foes of
            routine circumcision for boys, a judge ruled on Tuesday
            that a 9-year-old need not be circumcised as his mother
            wanted.</p>

            <p>A dispute between the boy's divorced parents about
            whether to circumcise him escalated into a court case,
            and Cook County Judge Jordan Kaplan declared in his
            ruling that it was unclear if the boy would benefit
            medically from having the procedure done.</p>

            <p>Witnesses for the boy's mother argued he had
            suffered infections underneath his foreskin. The
            father's expert witnesses said the mother had wrongly
            retracted his foreskin in order to clean his penis and
            had irritated the area.</p>

            <p>In granting the boy's father an injunction blocking
            the procedure, the judge said the boy could decide for
            himself whether to be circumcised when he turns 18.</p>

            <p>The case is sure to fuel arguments for and against
            male circumcision.</p>

            <p>The <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org"
            target="_blank">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> has
            said it does not recommend routine circumcision, though
            it does have some potential medical benefits.</p>

            <p>In a <a href="http://www.icgi.org/"
            target="_blank">statement</a>, the <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a> said
            the judge's ruling protected "the boy's legal right to
            bodily integrity."</p>

            <p>"Male circumcision in an irreversible amputation of
            functional tissue," it added.</p>

            <p>"The ruling opens a very interesting question," said
            the group's John Geisheker. "If the benefits of
            circumcision are not available to a 9-year-old, what
            does that say about infants?"</p>

            <p>At least one study has shown infants that have been
            circumcised later show a greater sensitivity to pain,
            "an infant analog to post-traumatic stress disorder,"
            Geisheker said.</p>

            <p>On the opposing side, studies have shown men who are
            uncircumcised are more prone to becoming infected with
            HIV, as well as other sexually transmitted
            diseases.</p>

            <p>The practice of circumcising infant males is rare in
            Europe, while it is declining but remains common in the
            United States.</p>
