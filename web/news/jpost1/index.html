      <h2>Baby recovers from 'brit mila' amputation</h2>
      By Judy Siegel 

      <p>AFULA (August 14) - A baby whose penis was accidentally
      amputated below the corona by the mohel (ritual circumciser)
      and reattached by microsurgery a month ago was declared fully
      recovered yesterday at Ha'emek Hospital in Afula.</p>

      <p>Hospital spokesman Danny Brenner said the baby is now able
      to urinate normally, and the penile blood vessels and nerves
      are fully functioning. The hospital reported the highly
      unusual incident to the Health Ministry, but Ha'emek still
      doesn't know the identify of the mohel, as the family refused
      to give his name and have not yet filed a complaint.</p>

      <p>The parents rushed the baby to the hospital four weeks ago
      carrying a plastic bag with the glans penis kept in ice. Dr.
      Ya'acov Rosenman, deputy head of the urology department, and
      Dr. Boris Lachman performed the painstaking operation, which
      took more than eight hours.</p>

      <p>Rabbi Yosef Weisberg, the ministry's national supervisor
      of ritual circumcisers, had not yet been informed of the
      case. "If asked, our committee will investigate. Such a thing
      is extremely rare, but I have heard of one or two other cases
      here over the year. Any mohel who does such a thing must be
      blind, have taken a drink, or been pushed while performing
      the brit mila," he said.</p>

      <p>The fact that there is no circumcision law, "due to
      pressure from American Conservative, Reform, and female
      circumcisers who are afraid they'll be left out," means there
      are unlicensed mohelim, Weisberg said, but he could not
      estimate how many there were out of the total of several
      hundred practicing mohelim in the country.</p>

      <p>Brenner said that it was possible the family would
      complain to the police or sue the mohel for damages now that
      the child had recovered, "or maybe they received payment from
      the circumciser to keep quiet about the incident."</p>

      <p>Although amputation of the penis is rare in children, said
      Brenner, the world's top medical experts in reconnecting
      adult penises are in Thailand, as nearly every day,
      disgruntled wives cut off their husband's organs in a fit of
      anger or jealousy.</p>
