            misconduct</h2>

            <p>A former King County woman and her 8-year-old son
            have sued local gynecologist Charles Momah and his twin
            brother, Dennis Momah, saying that both men engaged in
            improper sexual behavior toward her.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/kcsc/"
            target="_blank">King County Superior Court</a> civil
            suit, filed late last week, contends that Dennis Momah,
            a general practitioner, posed as his brother during
            some of the visits from Darla Harper <span
            class="yellow">-- and one visit from her son, during
            which he allegedly mutilated the boy's genitals during
            a botched circumcision.</span> Harper has recently
            moved to California, according to her attorney, Seattle
            lawyer <a href="http://www.hbharti.com/"
            target="_blank">Harish Bharti</a>.</p>

            <p>In February, Bharti filed suit against both men on
            behalf of seven other women making similar claims of
            sexual harassment and assault. He has filed more than
            50 suits against Charles Momah since September
            2003.</p>

            <p>In September, Charles Momah, who ran gynecological
            clinics in Burien and Federal Way, pleaded not guilty
            to charges of rape, indecent liberties and insurance
            fraud.</p>

            <p>Neither of the Momahs' attorneys could be reached
            for comment yesterday.</p>
