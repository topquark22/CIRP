            being circumcised</h2>

            <h4>'Descriptive understanding' is painstaking
            work</h4>

            <p><b>Anne Marie Owens</b><br />
             National Post</p>

            <p><i>December 30, 2003</i></p>

            <p>For hours on end, the small group of British
            Columbia researchers sat in a darkened room, repeatedly
            watching videotapes of the circumcisions of 10 baby
            boys.</p>

            <p>As they observed the three video screens before
            them, the researchers systematically noted and itemized
            the behaviour they witnessed, assigning each head
            twitch, each leg kick, each eye squeezing, one of more
            than 230 designated codes on a scale meant to
            scientifically classify the infants' distress-related
            behaviour.</p>

            <p>For lead researcher <a
            href="http://www.school.nursing.ubc.ca/faculty/memberbio.asp?c=69.1013748054263&amp;t=1">
            Fay Warnock</a>, a professor at the <a
            href="http://www.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">University of
            British Columbia</a>'s <a
            href="http://www.school.nursing.ubc.ca/">School of
            Nursing</a>, this kind of detailed data collection
            meant exhaustive and successive viewing of each of
            these 90-minute tapes on a second-by-second basis.</p>

            <p>Dr. Warnock says her work "is very basic in that it
            is focused on detailing normally occurring newborn
            pain-related distress behaviours.... Its usefulness is
            conceptual and, hopefully, will result in a deeper and
            more comprehensive descriptive understanding of newborn
            pain expression."</p>

            <p>She says the <a
            href="/library/pain/warnock1/">study</a> focused on
            circumcision because it is "an intense form of newborn
            acute pain," but stressed that further research in this
            area requires ongoing descriptions of other kinds of
            acute pain.</p>

            <p>While impassioned debates about the pros and cons of
            circumcision continue unabated in living rooms and
            medical offices across the country, Dr. Warnock and her
            researchers stared at the loop of images for days on
            end, intently scrutinizing the most minute
            responses.</p>

            <p>For the purposes of the study, each of the baby's
            anatomical regions (head, upper torso, upper
            extremities, etc.) was viewed in successive order and
            the videotape was run at fast-forward speed to identify
            further changes and any natural clustering in
            behaviours. Speeding up the tape and playing up to
            three videotapes concurrently also made it easier to
            identify when, and under what circumstances, certain
            behaviours occurred together and in all babies.</p>

            <p>The equipment allowed the researchers to monitor the
            screens at a pace of 30 frames per second, but the
            observation process actually meant it took a skilled
            rater about 2 1/2 hours to code a single minute of
            videotaped data.</p>

            <p>In the end, all of these minute observations were
            compiled to create an exhaustive behavioural scientific
            listing, or ethogram, of neonatal distress behaviour in
            response to acute pain.</p>

            <p>The completed ethogram, outlined this year in a
            paper in the journal <i>Infant Behaviour &amp;
            Development</i>, is an eight-page roster of various
            motor movements, positionings, respirations and
            vocalizations. In this format, the quality of each
            baby's body movement fits one of seven categories,
            ranging from nil to frantic to tremulous, jerky and
            unco-ordinated; respiration is further classified in
            one of 15 ways, including grunt, gasp, gag, hiccup,
            catching and rapid inspiration.</p>

            <p>Dr. Warnock says this preliminary ethogram showed a
            wide range of distress behaviours that can be easily
            and reliably identified, including some responses
            previously unidentified by researchers, such as:
            gasping and breath-holding; exaggerated shift-like
            movements of the upper torso; strained downward
            movements of the shoulders; and flailing, frantic
            movements of the upper and lower extremities.</p>

            <p>She is quick to say this research, though
            fascinating, has no immediate or direct practical
            benefit because it represents descriptive, conceptual
            information about a single instance of pain --
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>"Because my work is basic, it cannot be interpreted
            at this stage to be clinically applicable.... The aim
            was to add to pain behaviour knowledge simply by
            describing behaviours about which we know little."</p>
