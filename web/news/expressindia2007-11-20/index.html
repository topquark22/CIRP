            <h2>Unjha doctors strike work</h2>

            <p><b>Ahmedabad, November 19</b> Doctors in the north
            Gujarat town of Unjha stayed off their clinics and
            hospitals on Monday, refusing to take up even emergency
            cases, which they diverted to the Government hospital.
            The strike was in protest against the attack on a
            hospital by relatives of a patient on Sunday. The
            hospital was vandalised, vehicles gutted and two
            doctors were manhandled on Sunday.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">According to Dr Anil Patel,
            vice-president of Unjha Medical Association, trouble
            started after Kuldeep Kumar Vishnubhai Patel (10), who
            had undergone a minor surgery for circumcision at Anand
            Hospital on Sunday morning, died about two hours later.
            Dr Patel, who is an anaesthetist, was present during
            the operation which was performed by Dr P K Patel. "The
            surgery was successful but due to the carelessness
            shown by the relatives, the boy died in a couple of
            hours. The death enraged them and they attacked the
            hospital.</span> We could save our lives only by
            bolting the doors from inside until police came. They
            had to control the situation by bursting teargas
            shells," said Dr P K Patel. He said that the boy was
            brought from nearby Unava town for circumcision on
            medical grounds.</p>

            <p>Cross complaints were lodged and police had provided
            protection to the doctors following threat to their
            lives. "We have already got the post-mortem examination
            done to ascertain the reason of death and are awaiting
            the report," he further said.</p>

            <p>Till reports last came in, a meeting of local NGOs and
            prominent people was to be held on Monday evening to
            express support for the doctors. All the 33 doctors in
            Unjha and another 30 in surrounding areas remained on
            strike. Asked if people would suffer because of denial
            of emergency treatment, Dr Anil Patel said there were
            not many patients because of the festive season.</p>

            <p>Dr Bipin Patel, honorary general secretary of state
            branch of <a href="http://www.imanational.com/"
            target="_blank">Indian Medical Association</a>, said
            that the Government should take strict action against
            those responsible for the attack on doctors. According
            to Unjha police, they have registered cross complaints
            in this case and inspector C R Parmar is investigating
            the case.</p>
