            <h3>Circumcision Is Botched, Repair Never
            Recommended</h3>

            <p><b>$1.26 Million Settlement</b></p>

            <p>On Sept. 3, 1994, two days after the birth of a
            healthy, African-American baby boy, the defendant
            pediatrician visited the child's parents and offered to
            perform an elective circumcision. While the mother was
            initially reluctant, she claimed that she was
            ultimately persuaded by the defendant that circumcision
            was medically advisable.</p>

            <p>The plaintiff alleged that the defendant never
            mentioned or noted any pre-existing condition or
            anomaly that added any additional risk to the
            circumcision procedure. The defendant reportedly
            assured the parents that he had successfully performed
            numerous circumcisions in the past without
            incident.</p>

            <p>On Sept. 3, 1994, the defendant performed an
            elective neonatal circumcision on the minor using a <a
            href="/library/procedure/mogen/">Mogen clamp</a>.</p>

            <p>During the procedure, the defendant inadvertently
            amputated a portion of the minor's glans penis. The
            defendant attempted to repair the damage by closing a
            portion of the glans with three 5-0 chromic sutures. As
            a result, the minor sustained a loss of tissue on his
            glans penis, measuring 5 by 4 millimeters.</p>

            <p>The plaintiff alleged that the defendant did not
            request or otherwise recommend surgical repair by a
            pediatric surgeon, which, the plaintiff's expert was
            prepared to testify, would likely have improved the
            cosmetic result and reduced the degree of resulting
            hypospadias.</p>

            <p>Type of action: Medical Malpractice<br />
            Injuries alleged: Partial amputation of tip of glans
            penis<br />
            Name of case: Withheld<br />
            Court/case #: U.S. District Court (case no. withheld)
            Tried before judge or jury: N/A (settled)<br />
            Name of judge: Michael A. Ponsor<br />
            Amount of settlement: <span class="yellow">$1.26
            million structured settlement (present day value of
            $550,000 cash)</span><br />
