             THE SALT LAKE TRIBUNE</p>

            <p>Circumcisions or hearing aids?</p>

            <p>It may come down to that choice in Utah's <a
            href="http://le.utah.gov/"
            target="_blank">Legislature</a> this year, with the
            state facing the worst economic downturn in more than a
            decade.</p>

            <p>Thursday, an advocate for low-income residents
            suggested sacrificing <a
            href="http://www.health.utah.gov/html/utah_medicaid.html"
            target="_blank">Medicaid</a> coverage for
            circumcisions may be the only way to restore audiology
            services, which were cut last year.</p>

            <p>Squirming House Republicans giggled during a caucus
            when Judi Hilman, of <a
            href="http://www.xmission.com/~ui/"
            target="_blank">Utah Issues</a>, said, "While we're not
            entirely comfortable with cutting circumcisions. . . .
            "</p>

            <p>But Hilman was deadly serious -- and so is the
            financial crisis facing Medicaid, the federally
            subsidized, state-run health care insurance that serves
            260,000 low-income Utahns.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Circumcision, while a
            long-standing cultural custom for newborn males, "is
            not medically necessary," she noted.</span> "Audiology
            is, especially if that person is to live and work in
            the community."</p>

            <p>The value judgment isn't an easy one for Hilman, who
            is Jewish and thus steeped in the religious requirement
            of circumcision. "I feel very ambivalent about it."</p>

            <p>But it's the kind of tough decision that lawmakers
            are being forced to face this year.</p>

            <p>Advocates say the state needs to come up with $50
            million just to shore up and restore Medicaid to its
            basic service level. It's a life-and-death issue for
            many, they warn.</p>

            <p>But lawmakers say they will be lucky to come up with
            a little more than half that.</p>

            <p>"We're hoping to get $30 million," said Vernal
            Republican Rep. Jack Seitz, House chairman of the
            Health and Human Services budget committee. "It costs
            $20 million just to cover increased utilization and
            replace one-time funding" used last year to temporarily
            plug shortfalls.</p>

            <p>The makeshift financing wasn't enough to keep the
            program intact. Along with cutting audiology services,
            Medicaid overseers have in recent months cut dental and
            vision care, physical therapy and some services for HIV
            and tuberculosis patients.</p>

            <p>Effective next month, more than 5,000 Medicaid
            patients will be booted off, said Hilman, as
            eligibility requirements are tightened.</p>

            <p>Instead of covering everyone up to the federal
            poverty threshold, the state will accept only those at
            75 percent of poverty-level income.</p>

            <p>The runaway price hikes on prescription drugs and
            health care, combined with the swelling ranks of poor
            are fueling huge Medicaid increases in Utah, just as in
            most states.</p>

            <p>"Eventually," said Seitz, "it's going to catch up
            and break us."</p>
