      <h1>Child awarded damages</h1>
      <br />

      <p class="text">SEATTLE (AP) &mdash; A three-year-old child
      who is undergoing sex change operations because he was badly
      burned during a routine circumcision has been awarded
      $750,000.</p>

      <p class="text">U.S. District Judge Walter McGovern also
      awarded $100,000 to the child's parents and ordered
      compensation for the family's medical bills which exceeded
      $30,000.</p>

      <p class="text">Witnesses during the two-day malpractice
      trial testified that a military doctor, performing a routine
      circumcision when the boy was five months old, burned the
      baby's genital area so badly that physicians eventually
      advised changing the child's sex to female.</p>

      <p class="text">"The parent-child relationship is affected,"
      Judge McGovern said. "In future years they will look at
      certain of her activities and wonder if she is beginning to
      revert to male."</p>

      <p class="text">The greatest danger, doctors said is of deep
      psychological trauma if the child learns that she was born a
      male.</p>

      <p class="text">The child has undergone eight operations and
      faces several more.</p>

      <p class="text">Doctors testified that lifetime treatment
      with hormones will develop and maintain a feminine body,
      though she never will be able to have children and will have
      a 50 per cent chance of sexual response.</p>
