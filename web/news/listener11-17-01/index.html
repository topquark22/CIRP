      <h1>The First Cut</h1>

      <p><b>As circumcision rates drop, several generations of Kiwi
      males now look slightly different to their dads. But will we
      follow some countries and legislate?</b></p>

      <p>BY ALISTAIR BONE</p>

      <p><span>O</span>n June 1, <a href="/news/bbc10-01-01/">the
      Swedish parliament passed a groundbreaking new law</a>. The
      legislation was aimed at Sweden's burgeoning Muslim
      population, to whom the practice of circumcision is a holy
      writ, and too many of whom were presenting their mutilated
      infants at hospital emergency wards after botched backyard
      operations. Now circumcision in Sweden can only be carried
      out on boys under the age two months, and a registered nurse
      or doctor must give local anaesthesia. Male who have reached
      the age of consent can also decide to have it done. The
      reaction was immediate and vocal. The loudest response came
      from the Jewish community, for whom the practice is also part
      of a holy covenant with God. "People have compared the
      regulation to those of Nazi Germany implemented against the
      Jews," complained the chairwoman of Stockholm's Jewish
      community. "I think the backlash will be tremendous around
      the world said Stockholm's Rabbi. It is indicative of the
      heat of the debate that such comments are made about a simple
      medical safeguard for a minor operation. Circumcision, a
      process widely derided by many surgeons and GPs as of no
      benefit and of negative effect, yet fiercely defended as a
      vital part of cultural and religious identity by others, is
      the anachronism that refuses to die.</p>

      <p><span>H</span>ard figures are difficult to come by on the
      local circumcision scene. The <a
      href="http://www.nzma.org.nz/">New Zealand Medical
      Association</a>'s best guess is that around 10% of baby boys
      are circumcised. Other research indicates a wide cultural and
      racial split, with only about 1% of caucasian boys, but
      nearly 100% of Tongan, Samoan, and Jewish boys, currently
      having the operation done. Australia has similar figures to
      us, but in the US nearly 63% of babies are circumcised and in
      the UK somewhat less than 4%. It is relatively unknown in
      continental Europe, South America and non-Muslim Asia.</p>

      <p class="2">The origins of the practice are older than all
      major religions and recorded history. No one can remember why
      we do it. Outside of the wishes of a deity, or as rite of
      passage, there have been a number of medical justifications
      put forward, including- a cure to masturbation, epilepsy,
      eczema, idiocy, and headaches. Recently, it has been touted
      as preventing urinary tract infections, penile cancer and
      Aids. "Rubbish," says senior lecturer in pathology at <a
      href="http://www.aut.ac.nz/">Auckland University of
      Technology</a> and anti-circumcision campaigner Ken McGrath.
      "The urinary tract justification is one of the worse studies
      I have seen in terms of bad design bias, incompetence in
      structuring the study and iatrogenic effects [investigators
      causing the infections]. They have been rubbished and never
      duplicated. I don't think anyone with any scientific
      discrimination would accept them.</p>

      <p class="2">Similarly, the penile cancer myth "That has been
      debunked since it came out, again it has never been
      replicated and there have been consistent reports of cancer
      in the circumcised male. There are four times more incidence
      of breast cancer in males than penile cancer anyway, but no
      one is suggesting you cut off men's nipples, even though you
      would do four times as much good if you did that to every boy
      rather than mucking about with their penis." And Aids? "That
      study really is silly - it has a truck driven through it. It
      has a serious set of statistical biases. Also, it suggests
      that the foreskin is at risk because it contains Langerhans
      cells. The cells are found in all skin. I predict that Aids
      will disappear as a reason, too, within five years they will
      have to find another reason for justifying circumcision -
      apart from money and cultural imperialism."</p>

      <p class="2">Money is certainly a factor. <a
      href="http://www.southerncross.co.nz/">Southern Cross
      Healthcare</a>'s median payment for the operation was $1445
      in 1999. A limited US study found that the the median charge
      was $US121. Circumcision opponents in that country estimate
      the total cost at up to $US2billion a year (McGrath says
      $US200million is more believable), and at least one US doctor
      dines out on the line that "Every American boy is born with a
      $100 bill under his foreskin. All you have to do to get it is
      take it off."</p>

      <p class="2">Reduced sexual pleasure is another cost in the
      circumcised male. Sixty percent of the skin of the foreskin
      is removed during circumcision and with it goes most of the
      penis' epicritical sensory system - complex transducers with
      very high resolution in sensitivity equivalent in sensitivity
      to the fingertip. What is left on the glans itself are the
      protopathic pathways, a very simple system of free nerve
      endings equivalent to in sensitivity to the heel of the
      foot.</p>

      <p class="2">Some research suggests disruption of
      circulation, bad hygiene and even neurological damage are a
      possibility, even after a successful operation. Curvature of
      the penis is also present in about 70 percent of circumcised
      males, and almost non-existent among the uncircumcised, but
      most medical complications stem from a botched procedure.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.noharmm.org/nodculture.htm">Dr Percy
      Pease</a> has been a consulting paediatric surgeon with a
      specialty in pediatric urology for 27 years. He sees about
      one botched circumcision a month. "It is usually when too
      much skin has been taken off, generally people from the
      Pacific Island community." He has noted a drop in the number
      of people having the procedure done. "Even some European and
      New Zealand Jewish people are not having their kids
      circumcised. People question what the validity of it is when
      it is botched and have a hard time dealing with the guilt.
      I'll do them if people insist, only because I can do them
      properly." Currently the New Zealand Medical Association
      recognizes no preventative medical health benefits from
      circumcision. The <a href="/library/statements/bma/">British
      Medical Association</a> considers it a radical invasive
      procedure and states that unless conservative treatments are
      tried first a therapeutic circumcision would be
      unethical.</p>

      <p class="inset">"Even some European and New Zealand Jewish
      people are not having their kids circumcised. People question
      the validity of it when it is botched and have a hard time
      dealing with the guilt."<br />
      --DR PERCY PEASE</p>

      <p><span>I</span>n New Zealand, the debate is just getting
      under way and seems likely to focus on human rights. As a
      signatory to the binding <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">International Covenant
      on the Rights of the Child</a>, we have agreed to "...take
      all effective and appropriate measures with a view to
      abolishing traditional procedures prejudicial to the health
      of children". Which some see as a warrant to ban the practice
      of ritual male circumcision. "The religious and cultural
      thing can be solved by letting the 16-year-old make his own
      decision," says McGrath.</p>

      <p class="2">The heat in the local argument indeed lies with
      those who seek to outlaw the process rather than those who
      seek to maintain the status quo. Orthodox Jewish Rabbi Jeremy
      Lawrence is relaxed about the new Swedish law. "There is
      every legitimate right for a government to make sure
      religious practice can be done within suitable medical
      paradigms," he says, but adds that a spiritual dimension may
      be lost by interfering with the ministrations of the Mohel,
      the person in Jewish culture who traditionally performs the
      circumcision.</p>

      <p class="2">Rabbi Lawrence objects to delaying the process
      until the child is of an age where he can legally consent.
      "Certainly it is much harder for someone who is older or
      sexually active to contemplate having that procedure.
      Deferring consent until it becomes more informed means you
      are creating a psychological barrier to changing who you are.
      If you say that a person is more able to weigh up the pros
      and cons when they are older, that may be true, if that is
      your sole value and criterion. If you say a child has a right
      to be brought up with a its heritage [another part of the
      International Covenant], to bring up a child alienated from
      what God has set out for them is a fundamental breach of the
      human right to spiritual and national identity."</p>

      <p class="2"><span>S</span>imilar views exist with in Pacific
      Island society. Traditional Pacific Island Circumcision
      practice is different for European, a "dorsal slit" or
      supercision is usually performed on boys between nine and 15.
      This practice is not as damaging to the foreskin, although it
      also has the effect of toughening the glans and making it
      less sensitive.</p>

      <p class="2">Dr Sitaleki Finau is a senior lecturer at
      Auckland Medical School and Professor of Public Health at the
      Fiji School of Medicine. He dismisses anti-circumcision views
      on penile cancer and Aids. "Those who argue are those who
      don't understand the literature," he says. The practice was
      well established in the islands even before Christianity
      endorsed it. "If you're not circumcised, you are not a man,
      you haven't gone through the rites of passage and you are
      considered dirty." There are three Pacific-run clinics in
      Auckland that perform the operation for a break-even fee of
      $150. The clinics provide a check-up service as part of that
      fee. "We find hepatitis B, anemia, worms, that type of thing
      and treat them, too, and some of these kids haven't seen a
      doctor for a long while. About 280 kids have been done in the
      last couple of years and the practice of backyard
      circumcisions is starting to disappear." And the question of
      rights? "To whom does the child belong?" says Finau. "My
      stance is that if parents are responsible for children, they
      should be responsible for the decision made on behalf of
      children. Why is the penis different from the ear or ear
      piercing? It is less dangerous than liposuction or a facelift
      or any of those other things people do for fun."</p>

      <p class="2">The Swedish model would be a particularly good
      thing but is not applicable in the current hostile climate.
      "If circumcision was accepted in New Zealand we could develop
      a guideline, but there isn't one. If the medical profession
      doesn't accept it and it's becoming a lost skill."</p>

      <p class="2">The <a
      href="http://www.occ.org.nz/aboutus/">Commissioner for
      Children</a>, Roger McClay, will be in the thick of the
      emerging debate. "If I was a newborn baby tonight and I could
      speak, I would say, 'Can you hold off a bit until I can make
      up my own mind.' But, by the same token, would a child want
      to grow up in a culture or with a religious belief of its
      parents and be different from everybody else?" The difficulty
      is in deciding it. But we should be talking about it." It is
      a very hard one. I would like to see a debate. It would be
      worth raising and it needs to be.</p>
