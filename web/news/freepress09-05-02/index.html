            <h2>The return of the foreskin</h2>

            <p><b>Catherine Mitchell</b></p>

            <p>What would you say to a doctor who stood at your
            hospital bedside, a day after you gave birth and said:
            "Congratulations. Now give me your newborn son. We want
            to do a quick surgical procedure; just a few quick
            cuts. It's not medically necessary -- heck, it's not
            even medically advised -- but it will give him a look
            some people prefer."</p>

            <p>Most would report that doctor. Yet, that description
            (of the procedure, not the process) pretty accurately
            applies to elective circumcision for newborns and
            thousands of parents still request that their days-old
            sons get circumcised. Odd, to say the least, given that
            circumcision is not supported by numerous medical
            societies in Canada, indeed the world.</p>

            <p>Manitoba is the only province that pays for routine
            circumcision of newborns. It pays a petty $19.50 to the
            physician. It takes all of few minutes.</p>

            <p>Manitoba and Saskatchewan are said to have the
            highest rates of circumcision in Canada, at 26 per cent
            and 27 per cent respectively. (Newfoundland is said to
            be lowest, at 0.6 per cent.) But Saskatchewan delisted
            circumcision as an insured procedure long ago and the
            <a href="http://www.quadrant.net/cpss/"
            target="_blank">College of Physicians and Surgeons</a>
            there has <a
            href="http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/167/5/532-a"
            target="_blank">aggressively pursued the issue</a> with
            physicians, <a
            href="/library/statements/sask2002/">challenging them
            to do the medically appropriate thing and tell parents
            that the risks outweigh the benefits</a>.</p>

            <p>And so the question is, why?</p>

            <p>Why subject a newborn baby boy to the pain and
            suffering -- the operation itself is done with pain
            control but drugs wear off -- and the risk of an
            unnecessary medical procedure?</p>

            <p>This is not about the <a
            href="/news/thewestern08-31-02/">British Columbia
            baby</a> who, at five weeks, died last month following
            circumcision. The cause of the death is unknown, but in
            any case, medical literature indicates that <a
            href="/library/general/baker1/">death is a very rare
            outcome</a>. Yet there are risks in any medical
            procedure and in circumcision they run from minor
            bleeding to severe, indeed.</p>

            <p>This is about the seemingly cavalier attitude some
            doctors and parents have about subjecting a days-old
            infant to a surgery the very thought of which can turn
            grown men's legs to jelly. Some physicians refuse to do
            elective circumcisions, but clearly not all feel this
            strongly.</p>

            <p>In Manitoba, <a
            href="http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/167/6/629-a"
            target="_blank">1,802 newborns were circumcised last
            year</a>. That's 26 per cent of the boys born that
            year, compared to 35 per cent circumcised in 1992.</p>

            <p>That it has not dropped further may be due to a
            passive attitude about a surgical procedure that 30
            years ago was recommended and believed to be
            beneficial.</p>

            <p>But there is also ample argument supporting each end
            of the debate and people who come to the issue with
            bias can choose accordingly. As far as medical evidence
            is concerned, however, it is almost overwhelmingly
            against lopping off the foreskin without compelling
            medical reason.</p>

            <p>I say almost because from Manitoba research springs
            evidence that circumcision has protective value against
            HIV.</p>

            <p>For years, internal medicine specialists and
            microbiologists undertaking AIDS research in Africa
            have been documenting a powerful association that shows
            uncircumcised men at much higher risk for contracting
            HIV through heterosexual sex. The risk is as much as
            three times greater for uncircumcised men as it is for
            circumcised men. It was first noted as a "tentative
            observation" by scientists from the University of
            Manitoba in 1987 and has gathered steam with a cascade
            of similar observational studies by many others.</p>

            <p>To underscore those studies, Dr. Stephen Moses and
            colleagues from the United States and Kenya are
            conducting clinical trials with a particular group of
            Kenyan men. Imagine that; grown men signing up for an
            experiment involving circumcision. Must be mighty
            powerful motivation.</p>

            <p>And there is -- in Kenya, where rates of HIV
            infection run from an astounding 14 per cent to 30 per
            cent. In Canada, 4,000 people test positive for HIV
            each year and there are 50,000 -- less than one per
            cent of the Canadian population -- living with HIV
            today. Circumcision appears good medicine in Africa,
            but is it relevant to Canada? I suspect that if you ask
            your doctor, he or she would say no.</p>

            <p>Yet it's the closest you'll get to a rational reason
            for routinely circumcising babies in Canada. Most
            parents request it out of what's referred to as
            "social" factors -- because dad's been circumcised or
            to follow religious dogma.</p>

            <p>We rage at the thought that female circumcision
            (more accurately described as genital mutilation) takes
            place in Canada. We've even outlawed it. But few
            parents could medically defend circumcising their
            children.</p>

            <p>It seems to me that if you can look at your newborn
            and decide then that he is likely to be among a
            high-risk population, like those in Africa, then you
            have your answer as to whether it is appropriate to
            circumcise.</p>

            <p>Otherwise, let him decide for himself when he hits
            the age of reason.</p>
