            <h2>Dad appeals teen son's circumcision to U.S. Supreme
            Court</h2>

            <p>A divorced father who wants to circumcise his
            13-year-old son against the wishes of the boy's mother
            is trying to take his case to the <a
            href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/"
            target="_blank">U.S. Supreme Court</a><br />
            <br />
             <a href="http://www.familylawattorney1.com/"
            target="_blank">James Boldt</a>, who converted to
            Judaism, argues that preventing him from circumcising
            his son violates his constitutional right to practice
            his religion.<br />
            <br />
             The U.S. Supreme Court accepts a small fraction of the
            appeals it receives. A decision on whether it will take
            the case is not expected until the fall.<br />
            <br />
             Earlier this year, the <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/index.htm"
             target="_blank">Oregon Supreme Court</a> <a
            href="http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/S054714.htm"
             target="_blank">ruled</a> that the trial judge should
            determine what the boy wants.<br />
            <br />
             Boldt's ex-wife, Lia, a member of the <a
            href="http://russianorthodox.org/"
            target="_blank">Russian Orthodox Church</a>, says her
            son doesn't want the procedure but is afraid to tell
            his father.<br />
            <br />
             Lia Boldt also argued that circumcision was dangerous,
            a move that drew the attention of national Jewish
            organizations and an <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org"
            target="_blank">anti-circumcision group</a> based in
            Seattle.<br />
            <br />
             James Boldt now lives near <a href=""
            target="_blank">Olympia</a>. Lia Boldt lives in <a
            href="http://www.el.com/to/jacksonville/"
            target="_blank">Jacksonville</a>.<br />
            <br />
             James Boldt has custody of the boy, which he says
            gives him the right to make religious and medical
            decisions for his son.<br />
            <br />
             The couple married in the early 1990s and lived in <a
            href="http://www.ci.grants-pass.or.us/"
            target="_blank">Grants Pass</a>. She filed for divorce
            in 1998. The child initially lived with his mother, but
            his father later won custody.<br />
            <br />
             The father started studying Judaism in 1999 and later
            converted. He said he gradually introduced the boy to
            <a
            href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaism.html"
             target="_blank">Judaism</a>. By 2004, the child wanted
            to convert, which meant getting <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/taylor/"
            target="_blank">circumcised</a>.<br />
            <br />
             The boy had recently turned 9 when his father
            scheduled the procedure.<br />
            <br />
             The mother went to court. The judge ruled in favor of
            the father, but ordered him not to circumcise his son
            until the mother had finished her appeals.</p>
