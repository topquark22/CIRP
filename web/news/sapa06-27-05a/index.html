            27/06/2005 11:55 - (SA) 

            <p>Johannesburg - Fifteen boys have been admitted to
            Tshilidzini Hospital in Limpopo after botched
            circumcisions, the <a
            href="http://new.hst.org.za/links/index.php/270/"
            target="_blank">Limpopo health department</a> said on
            Monday.</p>

            <p>Department spokesperson Phuti Seloba said the boys
            were admitted after they were found in a serious
            condition at an illegal private clinic at Ha-Ramukhuba
            in the Vuwani district near Thohoyandou on Sunday
            afternoon.</p>

            <p>"The department got a tip-off about an illegal
            circumcision school and went to investigate. That's
            when they found the boys," said Seloba.</p>

            <p>"They are now in a critical but stable condition and
            we believe that they will be out of danger soon."</p>

            <p>Sebola called on parents to act responsibly and take
            their children to properly registered circumcision
            schools.</p>

            <p>"The department is tired of this kind of
            irresponsible behaviour from parents. There are
            registered, fully functioning circumcision schools in
            the province and parents are aware of them," said
            Seloba.</p>

            <p>"Workshops were conducted in the province to educate
            parents about the schools, but it seems they prefer
            backdoor circumcisions, which are very dangerous and
            painful."</p>

            <p>Seloba said the department was investigating
            possible ways to deal with people operating illegal
            circumcision schools.</p>
