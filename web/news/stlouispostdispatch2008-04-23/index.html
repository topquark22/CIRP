            <h2>More parents opt not to circumcise their sons</h2>
            By Blythe Bernhard<br />
             ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH 04/23/2008 

            <p>When Michelle Timke's son was born 12 years ago, she
            had the baby circumcised because "that's just what you
            did."<br />
            <br />
             Ten years later, when pregnant with her second son,
            Banyan, who is now 21 months, she researched the topic
            with her husband. They decided against it, believing
            circumcision is only a cosmetic surgery.<br />
            <br />
             Timke expected the medical staff to frown on the
            decision. But instead, Timke recalled, a delivery nurse
            at <a href="http://www.stlukes-stl.com/"
            target="_blank">St. Luke's Hospital</a> in Chesterfield
            said she didn't understand why so many people go ahead
            with it.<br />
            <br />
             Circumcision isn't the automatic procedure it used to
            be. In the 1960s, circumcision rates peaked at 85
            percent. Now, only about half of all baby boys are
            circumcised, according to the <a
            href="http://www.ahrq.gov/" target="_blank">Agency for
            Healthcare Research and Quality</a>.<br />
            <br />
             Rates vary widely by region and are lowest on the West
            Coast, where only one out of three baby boys gets the
            procedure.<br />
            <br />
             In St. Louis, local hospitals report circumcision
            rates of 75 percent to 90 percent. But there are signs
            that the trend is making its way here. Doctors say
            parents are asking more questions about the procedure
            and thinking more critically about the decision.<br />
            <br />
             Part of the national trend can be attributed to
            immigration from Latin American and Asian countries,
            where the procedure is less common. But there's also a
            growing number of parents who are deciding against it
            because they see it as an unnecessary or unnatural
            intervention.<br />
            <br />
             Circumcision, or removal of the foreskin surrounding
            the tip of the penis, involves pulling and clamping the
            skin to cut off blood flow before making the incision.
            The procedure typically takes 10 minutes and is usually
            done before the baby leaves the hospital. Doctors
            routinely use anesthesia to reduce pain, and
            complications from the surgery are rare.<br />
            <br />
             Some religions, including Judaism and Islam, consider
            circumcision a holy ritual and a connection to previous
            and future generations. Circumcision as a medical
            procedure is primarily an American custom, starting
            with Victorian-era beliefs about cleanliness and
            chastity, according to historians. The procedure became
            routine in hospitals in the early 1900s, and continued
            as the accepted practice for parents and doctors.<br />
            <br />
             The medical reasons for circumcising are less clear.
            The <a href="http://www.aap.org"
            target="_blank">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>
            leaves the decision to parents and their doctors,
            saying the pros and cons are not significant enough to
            make a recommendation either way.<br />
            <br />
             <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/"
            target="_blank">Complications from the procedure</a>,
            including inflammation or excessive bleeding, are rare.
            Circumcised boys develop fewer urinary tract infections
            in their first year (about 1 in 1,000) compared to
            uncircumcised boys (1 in 100). The risk of penile
            cancer is reduced in circumcised men, although the
            overall risk of the disease remains very low.<br />
            <br />
             Conflicting research doesn't give a clear answer on
            whether circumcision reduces the risk of sexually
            transmitted diseases or affects sexual sensitivity.
            Recent studies out of Africa suggest circumcised men
            are less likely to acquire HIV from an infected woman.
            But circumcision is not considered an effective defense
            against the virus.<br />
            <br />
             "I tell people there's not a real medical reason for
            them to have a circumcision," said Dr. Jack Klein,
            chief of obstetrics at <a
            href="http://www.missouribaptist.org/"
            target="_blank">Missouri Baptist Medical Center</a>,
            where 1,873 of the 2,144 boys born in 2007 were
            circumcised. "I will tell you the majority reason that
            people get circumcised is because they want their kid
            to look like other kids."<br />
            <br />
             That <a href="/library/legal/USA/waldeck1/">social
            conformity</a> is reason enough, say some parents
            concerned about future locker room comparisons and
            sexual relationships.<br />
            <br />
             "I really didn't want to be faced with a teenage boy
            asking me why I didn't do this and not have a really
            good reason for him," St. Louis resident Amy Zimmerman
            said of her 2-year-old son John.<br />
            <br />
             Tricia Hagan of Des Peres and her husband spent five
            minutes discussing the issue.<br />
            <br />
             "We didn't ever really consider not doing it," she
            said. "Certainly as they become older and have
            girlfriends, it's just something to think about
            long-term."<br />
            <br />
             Some mothers said watching a video of a circumcision
            was enough to turn them against it.<br />
            <br />
             <span class="yellow">"I was sobbing by the end of it,"
            said Valerie Hickman of St. Louis, whose son Benjamin
            is 7 months old. "I find it a bit cruel to cut my
            newborn child for what I feel is a cosmetic
            preference."</span><br />
            <br />
             Other parents choose to leave the decision to their
            sons when they get older. But circumcisions on older
            boys and adults can be more complicated and
            expensive.<br />
            <br />
             Ultimately, it's a personal decision, said Dr. Joseph
            Kahn, chief of pediatrics at <a
            href="http://www.stjohnsmercy.org/" target="_blank">St.
            John's Mercy Medical Center</a>.<br />
            <br />
             "Like every decision for every surgery on every
            child," he said, "it really needs to be something
            that's discussed with the parents."</p>
