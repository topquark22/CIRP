            <p><b>N.C. will no longer help pay for routine infant
            procedure through Medicaid program</b></p>

            <p><b>MIKE STOBBE</b><br />
            Staff Writer</p>

            <p>North Carolina is eliminating Medicaid funding for
            routine infant circumcisions, a controversial decision
            that has a minute impact on the state budget but
            significant implications for some new parents.</p>

            <p>The N.C. <a
            href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/homePage.pl"
            target="_blank">General Assembly</a> dropped the
            funding from the budget it approved this week.</p>

            <p>"I think folks were tired of arguing about it. And I
            think there was extremely strong sentiment to take it
            out," said state Sen. Fountain Odom, D-Mecklenburg.</p>

            <p>Assuming Gov. Mike Easley signs the budget, most
            Medicaid-funded circumcisions should come to an end by
            November, said a spokeswoman for the N.C. <a
            href="http://www.dhhs.state.nc.us/"
            target="_blank">Department of Health and Human
            Services</a>.</p>

            <p>Medicaid is the government program that pays medical
            bills for the poor and disabled.</p>

            <p>Circumcision is a surgical procedure to remove the
            foreskin from a young boy's penis, usually performed in
            under 10 minutes.</p>

            <p>Each year, about 52 percent of N.C. Medicaid male
            newborns are circumcised. In South Carolina, it's 71
            percent.</p>

            <p>N.C. legislators say they eliminated the
            circumcision part of Medicaid for two reasons:
            Increasingly, doctors' groups have said the procedure
            is not medically necessary. And because of a budget
            crunch, necessary services had to be prioritized.</p>

            <p>Nine state Medicaid programs do not fund routine
            infant circumcisions. Three, including North Carolina,
            stopped this year.</p>

            <p>In North Carolina, the budget cut amounts to
            $400,000, or less than 0.003 percent of the $14.3
            billion total budget.</p>

            <p>The Medicaid program is funded by state tax dollars
            with an almost 200 percent federal match, so the
            $400,000 in state funding for Medicaid circumcisions
            translates to about $1.25 million overall.</p>

            <p>The state will continue to pay for circumcision in
            cases in which doctors agree circumcision is a medical
            necessity, said Lois Nilsen, spokeswoman for the state
            Medicaid program.</p>
