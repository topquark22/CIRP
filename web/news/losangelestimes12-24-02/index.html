            Disfiguration of Patients Is Alleged</p>

            <p>By Andrew Blankstein, Times Staff Writer</p>

            <p>A Santa Clarita man who allegedly performed female
            circumcisions and other illegal body alterations at his
            home was arrested on suspicion of practicing medicine
            without a license, state regulators said Monday.</p>

            <p>Todd Cameron Bertrang, 40, was
            arrested Thursday on suspicion of performing several
            dozen illegal and disfiguring medical procedures since
            1997, including clitoridectomies and penile piercings,
            according to investigators with the <a
            href="http://www.medbd.ca.gov/" target="_blank">Medical
            Board of California</a>. The agency is responsible for
            licensing and regulating physicians.</p>

            <p>"Your typical piercing doesn't rise to the level of
            practicing medicine, which requires a license," said
            John Hirai, supervising investigator for the
            agency.</p>

            <p>"In this case, Bertrang did procedures on people
            that altered their body beyond a typical piercing."</p>

            <p>The victims, who were mostly in their 20s, were
            evenly split between men and women, who sought out
            Bertrang to perform a variety of "body modifications,"
            Harai said. Bertrang detailed those practices on a Web
            site.</p>

            <p>Earlier this year, the site caught the attention of
            a doctor who reported to the medical board that
            Bertrang was performing clitoridectomies on women in
            Southern California. The agency launched an
            investigation under a unit known as Operation Safe
            Medicine.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/homepage.htm"
            target="_blank">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>,
            which had also received a complaint about Bertrang, had
            opened its own probe about the same time.</p>

            <p>"I've been with the medical board a long time, and I
            can't remember a case like this," said agency spokesman
            David Thorton. "It's unusual."</p>

            <p>Bertrang's arrest is the 10th this year through
            Operation Safe Medicine, which investigates dangerous
            or unlicensed medical practitioners.</p>

            <p>Anyone with information about other alleged victims
            of Bertrang, or any other possible criminal activity
            connected to him, are asked to contact the state
            medical board at (562) 860-2819. To confirm whether
            someone is licensed medical practitioner, call the
            board's information line at (916) 263-2382.</p>
