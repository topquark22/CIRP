            <h2>Wilson Signs Legislation Forbidding Genital
            Mutilation of Girls<br />
             The practice has appeared among recent immigrants</h2>
            <i>Robert B. Gunnison, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau</i> 

            <p><b>Sacramento</b></p>
            <br />

            <p>Governor Pete Wilson yesterday signed a bill to
            outlaw female genital mutilation, routinely practiced
            in 41 nations in the Middle East and Africa and most
            recently appearing in California among new
            immigrants.</p>

            <p>The bill by Assemblywoman Liz Figueroa, D-Hayward,
            was introduced after a newspaper reported five cases of
            genital mutilation were discovered among pregnant women
            in the San Jose area since 1980.</p>

            <p>``This legislation will help protect young girls
            from a mutilating procedure that can cause lifelong
            physical and psychological damage,'' Wilson said in a
            statement. ``Abolishing this cruel practice is vitally
            important for the health and welfare of these young
            girls.''</p>

            <p>The new law will add one year to the prison sentence
            of anyone who violates an existing statute that forbids
            unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering. The
            maximum term is currently six years in prison.</p>

            <p>The law also requires the state to conduct an
            education program about the health risks and emotional
            trauma of genital mutilation, which is usually
            administered to girls about age 13. Practiced by
            Muslims, Christians and other religions, the ritual is
            thought to keep girls virginal and wives faithful.</p>

            <p>The procedure can range from cutting the hood of the
            clitoris to the removal of the clitoris and tissue at
            the entrance to the vagina. It is often performed with
            unsterilized knives, razor blades or pieces of glass
            and done without anesthesia, causing pain and possible
            infertility, painful intercourse, chronic infections,
            incontinence, increased risk in childbirth and
            death.</p>

            <p>With a week left to dispose of dozens of measures
            sent to him by the Legislature last month, Wilson also
            signed a bill that will exempt food and cosmetic
            containers from a state law that required 25 percent of
            the package to be made of recycled materials.</p>

            <p>The industry contended that the rule, scheduled to
            take effect in January, would result in packages that
            contained a ``potential risk of contaminants,'' said
            Gene Livingston, lobbyist for the Soap and Detergent
            Association.</p>

            <p>``We're very pleased and relieved as well,''
            Livingston said. ``The previous law put us in a very
            difficult position. We couldn't comply with the law
            without compromising the safety of our packaging.''</p>

            <p>Opposing the bill were environmentalists, including
            Californians Against Waste, whose lobbyist Luke Breit,
            said that the technology existed to insure the purity
            of the containers. ``Plastics are the largest volume of
            materials going into landfills,'' he said.</p>

            <p>Also signed by Wilson was a bill by Assemblyman
            Richard Rainey, R-Walnut Creek, that only benefits a
            company in his district that converts methane gas from
            landfills into methanol.</p>

            <p>Rainey carried the legislation on behalf of TeraMeth
            Industries Inc., of Walnut Creek, the sole creator of a
            technology that converts landfill gases into
            alternative fuels.</p>

            <p>The bill requires the State Air Resources Board and
            local air quality districts to report on
            ``noncombustion landfill gas control technology''
            options.</p>

            <p>Right now, the only such option on the market is
            TeraMeth's product, which captures the methane gas
            generated from decomposing organic materials in
            landfills, refines it and creates methanol, which can
            be used in making clean-burning vehicle fuels.</p>

            <p>Rainey has said he hopes to give TeraMeth a chance
            to compete against other methods of disposing methane
            emissions from landfills by having the state list
            TeraMeth's technology as an option landfill owners can
            use.</p>

            <p>Vetoed by Wilson was a bill by Senator Quentin Kopp,
            independent-San Francisco, that would have required the
            state to transfer its rail cars and locomotives for
            local operation to the Peninsula Rail Transit District
            for service between San Jose and San Francisco.</p>

            <p>Wilson said the bill&mdash;which had only one
            dissenting vote in the Legislature&mdash;would ``alter
            the existing agreement negotiated between the
            Department (of Transportation) and the district as
            originally directed by the Legislature.''</p>

            <p>Transfer of the equipment was directed by the
            Legislature in 1988, but has been delayed by
            negotiations over such issues as liability for costs of
            toxic cleanup at stations.</p>
