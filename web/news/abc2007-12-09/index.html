            <h2>Doctors back call for circumcision ban</h2>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.amatas.com.au/"
            target="_blank">Australian Medical Association</a> has
            backed a call for laws banning the non-essential
            circumcision of infant boys.</p>

            <p>The Tasmanian Children's <a
            href="http://www.amatas.com.au/"
            target="_blank">Commissioner</a>, <a
            href="http://www.childcomm.tas.gov.au/cms/aboutus/whoisthecommissioner.php"
             target="_blank">Paul Mason</a>, says non-medical
            circumcision is a breach of human rights.</p>

            <p>The AMA's Tasmanian President, Haydn Walters, says
            they would support a ban on the practice, except where
            there are medical or religious reasons.</p>

            <p>He says there is only rarely a medical need to carry
            out the procedure.</p>

            <p>"There were quite a lot of folk myths around the
            advantages of circumcision. They've almost all been
            debunked," Prof Walters said.</p>

            <p>"There are some minimal advantages in some
            circumstances, particularly in some infectious
            diseases, but they're overwhelmingly balanced by
            disadvantages in other areas," he said.</p>
