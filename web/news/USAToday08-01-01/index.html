      <h2>Circumcision rate increases in Midwest</h2>
      <b>By Rita Rubin</b>,<br />
      USA TODAY 

      <p>In the "who knew?" department comes this tidbit from the
      National Center for Health Statistics:</p>

      <p>Newborn boys in the Midwest are more than twice as likely
      to be circumcised as newborn boys in the West. In 1999, the
      most recent year for which information is available, the
      Midwest led the country in circumcisions, with 81.4% of baby
      boys undergoing the procedure, in which the foreskin is
      removed from the penis.</p>

      <p>But only 36.7% of baby boys born that year in the West
      were circumcised, says a new report from the health
      statistics center, or <a
      href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/">NCHS</a>, part of the <a
      href="http://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention</a>.</p>

      <p>The NCHS has been collecting circumcision data since 1979,
      but this is the first time it has published the breakdown by
      region and race, says statistician Abigail Moss, who wrote
      the new report.</p>

      <p>From 1979 to 1999, the proportion of circumcised newborns
      nationwide and in the Northeast held steady at around 65%,
      according to the new report. But the percentages rose in the
      Midwest and the South and declined in the West.</p>

      <p>The South's rise, to 64.1% from 55.8%, probably is due to
      circumcision becoming more common among black Americans, Moss
      says. During the 1980s, white infants were about 13% more
      likely to be circumcised than black infants, according to her
      report. By 1999, though, the rates were nearly equal.</p>

      <p>As for the West's decline, she says, "I think the primary
      reason is the higher immigrant population and the increase in
      Hispanic births in the West."</p>

      <p>George Kaplan, a pediatric urologist in San Diego who
      served on the American Academy of Pediatrics task force on
      circumcision, notes that Hispanics and Asian immigrants don't
      routinely practice circumcision. Still, Kaplan says, he
      thinks even though the proportion of baby boys circumcised in
      the West has declined over the years, it's not quite as low
      as this new report indicates.</p>

      <p>Kaplan's task force concluded that there are no compelling
      health benefits or risks for circumcision. So the pediatrics
      academy recommends that parents consult their pediatrician
      and take into account religious, cultural and ethnic
      traditions.</p>

      <p>Newborns are circumcised for a variety of reasons, from
      health benefits&mdash;such as a reduced risk of the rare
      cancer of the penis&mdash;to Jewish and Muslim religious
      beliefs to fathers wanting their sons to look like them.</p>

      <p>Anti-circumcision groups, such as the National
      Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers, or
      <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/">NOCIRC</a>, argue that the
      procedure causes unnecessary pain in newborns and adversely
      affects men's sexual sensations.</p>

      <p>Dan Bollinger, founder of the Indiana chapter of NOCIRC,
      says the percentage of newborn boys who are circumcised in
      the USA actually has declined, thanks to the efforts of
      groups such as his.</p>

      <p>Citing a 1980 book, Circumcision: An American Health
      Fallacy by Edward Wallerstein, Bollinger says the U.S. rate
      was 85% in 1979. By his own <a
      href="/library/statistics/bollinger2003/">calculations</a>,
      he says, the rate had fallen to 59% in 1999.</p>
