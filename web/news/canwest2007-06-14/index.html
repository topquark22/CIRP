            <h4>Mark Brennae<br />

            Published: Thursday, June 14, 2007 

            <p>OTTAWA&mdash;A one-week-old Ontario infant died from
            complications after undergoing a circumcision in a
            provincial hospital.</p>

            <p>Information about the case was published in the
            April edition of Paediatric Child Health.</p>

            <p>The baby, whose name has been withheld by the
            parents, passed away after his bladder became enlarged
            to seven times their normal size.</p>

            <p>The child was born at an unidentified Ontario
            hospital "sometime in the last three years," said Dr.
            Jim Cairns, Ontario's deputy chief coroner. "The family
            wants to keep this anonymous."</p>

            <p>No charges were ever laid and no legal action was
            ever taken in the case.</p>

            <p>According to the Paediatric Child Health article,
            the boy was "bottlefed and was reported to be doing
            well when he was circumsized."</p>

            <p>Five hours later, the parents returned to their
            family doctor with the infant, who had become
            "irritable and had blue discoloration" below the belly
            button.</p>

            <p>Doctors noticed the discoloration and slight
            swelling of the penis, but sent the child home.</p>

            <p>Fourteen hours after the circumcision, according to
            Cairns, the child was brought to another hospital where
            doctors noted he was extremely irritable with marked
            swelling of the penis and bruising to the scrotum.</p>

            <p>The child was then transferred to a paediatric
            centre, where his bladder was diagnosed, Cairns said,
            to "seven or eight times its normal size."</p>

            <p>The PlastiBell ring, which is used to hold back the
            foreskin after circumcision, was removed and drained
            and the child went into shock.</p>

            <p>"If the PlastiBell had been taken off five hours
            after he got there, he would be alive," said
            Cairns.</p>

            <p>The child's death was attributed to septic
            shock&mdash;"an overwhelming infection, leading to
            multi-organ failure," Cairns said.</p>

            <p>"Death is rare after circumcision," said Cairns.
            "But complications can happen."</p>

            <p>The case was brought to Cairns's attention because
            the circumstances of every death of an Ontario child
            under five years of age must be reviewed by the
            provincial coroner's office.</p>
