            <p>Cape Town - An Eastern Cape boy has died after
            complications following a botched circumcision in Port
            St Johns, bringing the death toll to seven since the
            start of the initiation season two weeks ago.</p>

            <p>Eastern Cape health department spokesperson, Sizwe
            Kupelo, said the boy died on Monday due to
            complications after the procedure.</p>

            <p>Another boy, from Ngqeleni near Mthatha, faces
            possible amputation.</p>

            <p>"These boys are dying but are not supposed to die,"
            said Kupelo, urging the community not to wait until the
            eleventh hour before reporting suspicious
            practices.</p>

            <p>He said seven illegal surgeons have been arrested.
            Two were released due to a technicality, but could
            possibly be recharged.</p>

            <p>One of the two was being sought in connection with
            the death of the Port St Johns boy, said Kupelo.</p>
