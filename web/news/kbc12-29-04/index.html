            <h2>Circumciser Arrested</h2>

            <p>By <u>KBC Reporter</u> (<i>Wednesday, December 29,
            2004</i>)</p>

            <p>Police in Meru Central district have arrested a
            traditional circumciser who allegedly circumcised two
            men who had already undergone the cut.</p>

            <p>The suspect, Geoffrey Kiambi, went into hiding soon
            after realizing he was being sought together with some
            youth who forcefully circumcised Paul Mutwiri, 60, and
            Patrick Gatobu, 31, in Mikumbune sub-location yesterday
            morning.</p>

            <p>About 200 drunkard youths participated in the act
            and forcefully circumcised for the second time the two,
            after learning they had been circumcised in the
            hospital. The youths who were chanting traditional
            circumcision songs stormed their homes early in the
            morning and dragged them into a nearby river.</p>

            <p>They claimed that the two did not warrant to be
            called real men since they had undergone the cut in a
            hospital instead of the Ameru traditional circumcision.
            Area OCPD John Nyota said the suspect would be charged
            with causing grievous harm to the two victims.</p>

            <p>The victims are undergoing treatment at Nkubu Sub
            District Hospital.</p>
