            <p><b>SASKATOON -</b> Circumcisions in Canada are on
            the way out.</p>

            <p>Fewer than 14 per cent of Canadian infant boys were
            circumcised in 2003, a drop of nearly 36 per cent since
            1973, says the <a href="http://www.courtchallenge.com"
            target="_blank">Association for Genital
            Integrity</a>.</p>

            <p>According to data gathered from provincial health
            departments and Statistics Canada, the association says
            <a
            href="http://www.courtchallenge.com/refs/yr99p-e.html"
            target="_blank">male infant circumcision rates</a> are
            as high as 29.5 per cent in P.E.I. and as low as 1.1
            percent in Nova Scotia.</p>

            <p>Robin Walker, former president of the <a
            href="http://www.cps.ca" target="_blank">Canadian
            Paediatric Society</a>, said culture is often the
            biggest influence in choosing whether to remove the
            skin covering the head of the penis. So, too, is
            whether the father went under the knife, he said.</p>

            <p>The pediatric society says there is no medical need
            for circumcision. Walker said the only proven benefit
            is a reduced chance of urinary tract infection,
            &ldquo;and that is not, in the view of the CPS, a
            reason for inflicting it on a baby.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Risks include minor bleeding in about five percent
            of cases, and in rare instances, life-threatening
            infections or hemorrhage.</p>

            <p>Studies citing long-term benefits of circumcision
            &ndash; are &ldquo;questionable and unproven,&rdquo;
            Walker added.</p>

            <p>In most of Canada, parents must also pay for the
            surgical procedure, because it &lsquo;s deemed
            &ldquo;cosmetic.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Only Manitoba still covers circumcisions under
            medicare.</p>
