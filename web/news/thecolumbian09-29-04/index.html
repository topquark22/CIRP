            circumcision</h2>

            <p>Wednesday, September 29, 2004<br />
             <b>By KEN OLSEN, Columbian staff writer</b></p>

            <p>The mother of an 8-year-old Ridgefield boy must
            speak to investigators about her husband's botched
            attempt to circumcise their son, Clark County Superior
            Court Judge <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/courts/superior/judges.html"
             target="_blank">James Rulli</a> ruled Tuesday.</p>

            <p>The victim also must give a deposition Oct. 12, the
            judge ordered.</p>

            <p>Tammy Baxter and her nine children disappeared Sept.
            3, after Edwin B. Baxter tried to circumcise his son
            with a knife in the bathroom of the family home.
            Baxter, 33, tried to perform the operation after
            reading about it in the Old Testament, investigators
            said.</p>

            <p>He faces a charge of second-degree assault and is
            being held in the <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/sheriff/custody/Index.html"
             target="_blank">Clark County Jail</a> on $50,000
            bail.</p>

            <p>Senior deputy prosecutor <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/pa/criminal/childabuse.html"
             target="_blank">Kim Farr</a> asked for the
            court-ordered depositions because investigators have
            been unable to locate the wife and alleged victim, who
            are considered key witnesses in the case.</p>

            <p>Baxter's father, Bruce Baxter of Vancouver, spoke
            with Farr for nearly an hour after Tuesday's court
            hearing and promised to try to find Tammy Baxter and
            encourage her and her son to meet with investigators.
            But she is "fearful of being arrested herself or Child
            Protective Services taking her children," Farr
            said.</p>

            <p>"We're attempting to assist her in coming forward,"
            Farr added. "We're trying to convince her that hiding
            her children is bad for her husband's criminal case and
            bad for her interaction with <a
            href="http://www1.dshs.wa.gov/basicneeds/an2cps.html"
            target="_blank">Child Protective Services</a>," which
            also is interested in the family's well-being.</p>

            <p>Baxter's father had contacted Farr earlier to
            arrange a meeting with the mother and 8-year-old boy
            after hearing about the prosecutor's problems
            contacting the family. They didn't show up. And
            Baxter's father later called to say he'd been unable to
            locate the family, Farr said.</p>

            <p>Defense attorney Tony Lowe objected to the
            depositions on the grounds that investigators may be
            trying to build a criminal case against the mother.
            Investigators also have not attempted to contact Tammy
            Baxter when she attended her husband's earlier court
            appearances, Lowe said.</p>

            <p>"It's an abuse of process this is not an
            investigative tool," Lowe said.</p>

            <p>The judge disagreed.</p>

            <p>The judge did, however, agree to appoint a
            psychiatrist to examine Baxter to determine if he is
            competent to stand trial.</p>

            <p>When the judge pressed for reasons for the
            psychiatric examination, defense attorney Lowe alluded
            to a head injury Baxter received as a teenager. If the
            psychiatrist finds Baxter mentally incompetent to stand
            trial, prosecutors can ask that he be examined by
            experts at <a
            href="http://www1.dshs.wa.gov/mentalhealth/wsh.shtml"
            target="_blank">Western State Hospital</a>.</p>

            <p>Judge Rulli also denied Baxter's request for a new
            defense attorney.</p>

            <p>"I lack confidence in Mr. Lowe, sir," Baxter said
            when Rulli asked him to explain his dissatisfaction
            with Lowe. But Rulli said personality conflicts and the
            fact that an attorney can't spend unlimited time with a
            defendant aren't grounds for granting such a
            request.</p>

            <p>"I need proof he's not doing anything on your
            behalf," Rulli said.</p>

            <p>Update</p>

            <p>Previously: Investigators have been unable to
            interview the family of a man who allegedly attempted
            to circumcise his 8-year-old son.</p>

            <p>What's new: A Clark County Superior Court judge
            ordered 33-year-old Edwin B. Baxter's wife and son to
            give depositions to investigators in two weeks.</p>

            <p>What's next: Investigators will attempt to locate
            the family, missing since Sept. 3, and serve them with
            the court order.</p>
