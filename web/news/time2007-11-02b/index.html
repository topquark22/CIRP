            <h2>The Great Uncircumcision Debate</h2>
            Friday, Nov. 02, 2007<br />
             By JENINNE LEE-ST. JOHN 

            <p>In his early 30s, Sabin Prince's libido was waning
            and he wasn't enjoying sex as much as he once had. His
            urologist checked him out and told him that everything
            was normal, that he was perfectly healthy and that his
            problems were probably part hormonal and part
            psychological. Don't worry about it so much, the doctor
            said, you're psyching yourself out. Prince took the
            advice, tried to relax, and eventually started enjoying
            sex a little more. But he never fully regained his
            appetite &mdash; "I would go for four or five days
            longing to feel sexual," he says &mdash; and, so,
            earlier this year he started looking for answers
            online.<br />
            <br />
             After doing a few Web searches and trolling men's
            health chat rooms, Prince, an actor in Los Angeles,
            decided that his problem had less to do with a mental
            trap he was in than a physical flap he was missing: his
            foreskin. That is, he felt that the routine
            circumcision he had undergone as a baby had left him,
            now at age 47, desensitized from the years of exposure.
            The solution: for the past five months, he's been
            growing his foreskin back using a device he bought
            online called the TLC Tugger. "The changes!" he says,
            going on to describe his improved pleasure in expansive
            terms. Suffice it to say, "It's 100% more
            sensitive."<br />
            <br />
             As the number of newborn American boys who get
            circumcised <a href="/news/time2007-11-02/">appears to
            be declining</a>, the number of men uncircumcising
            themselves seems to be rising. Ron Low, who makes the
            conical silicone TLC Tugger, has sold about 9,000
            Tuggers since 2003. Stephen Kwan, sales manager of
            4restore.com, which makes a competing product, says
            sales of his stainless steel apparatus increase by
            about 15% each year. Many men, like Prince, restore
            their foreskins to improve sex; circumcision, after
            all, removes some of the most sensitive cells in the
            body. Others do it because they feel dry and
            uncomfortable. Some feel abnormal &mdash; though
            circumcision is customary in the U.S., it is uncommon
            in most of the rest of the world. Finally, since so
            many new parents are choosing to leave their baby boys
            intact, Low says, "I even hear from men that they want
            to look more like their son."<br />
            <br />
             Lucky for these men, they have an array of devices to
            choose from. That wasn't the case 20 years ago, when R.
            Wayne Griffiths, a construction inspector whom some
            consider the granddaddy of foreskin restoration,
            jury-rigged a system out of two ball bearings, which he
            taped to his penis to regrow the skin in a year and a
            half. That was the prototype for Foreballs, which he
            now sells for $130 a pop. Griffiths' invention has been
            joined over the years by about a dozen competitors,
            which use tape, tension, suction, weights and straps to
            gently coax the skin to expand over time. Among the
            options are the Tug Ahoy, T-Tape, VacuTrac and, of
            course, the 4restore and TLC Tugger &mdash; which Low,
            an industrial engineer, invented in his Northbrook,
            Ill., basement when he lost sensitivity in his mid-30s.
            "It certainly doesn't make any sense to me that nature
            would produce a part that is harmful," says Low.
            "Foreskin feels really good."<br />
            <br />
             So good, in fact, that many restorers have also become
            "intactivists" who say involuntary circumcision of
            newborn males is cosmetic surgery and a civil rights
            violation. When Prince realized his sensitivity loss
            was a result of being cut, he says, "I could feel so
            much anger building up in me because I didn't have a
            choice." Griffiths, who co-founded San
            Francisco&ndash;based NORM, or <a
            href="http://www.norm.org" target="_blank">National
            Organization of Restoring Men</a>, says, "I felt that I
            had been mutilated and denied the pleasures of a
            foreskin. I never felt comfortable in clothes because
            my glans was always being abraded." NORM now has
            outposts in Canada, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.
            But its message doesn't persuade everyone. "My
            daughters went and circumcised their boys even though I
            talked to them about it," Griffiths says. "I
            cried."<br />
            <br />
             But tradition is hard to break. And restoration isn't
            for everyone. Only a small minority of circumcised men
            report sensitivity loss and dryness. In fact, the
            National Health and Social Life survey by the
            University of Chicago found that sexual dysfunction is
            slightly more common in intact men. Still, for those
            cut men uncomfortable with their circumcisions but even
            more squeamish about tugging on or weighing down their
            penises, Canadian inventor Randy Tymkin has developed a
            foreskin substitute &mdash; a silky sheath that
            protects the penis and keeps it soft. It's called
            ManHood.</p>
