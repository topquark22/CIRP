             Court's decision appalls medical staff</h2>
            By Houcine Ait Mhand | Morocco TIMES 7/30/2006 

            <p><b><span class="yellow">The court of First Instance
            of Fez sentenced a medical staff involved in
            circumcision death of the Ivorian to one year'
            imprisonment each.</span></b></p>

            <p>Mohammed Raiss, a surgeon; Ahmed Oudghiri, an
            anaesthetist; Hassan Cheikh, a nurse; as well as three
            other medical employees were held responsible for the
            death of the 22-year-old Ivorian on the medical staff
            of Raiss clinic in Fez for their negligence, which led
            to the <span class="yellow">death of Bogui Nimba Josue
            Arthur Privat</span>, son of ex-secretary general of
            the Ivorian Ministry of Education.</p>

            <p>The Ivorian man, who wanted to convert to Islam, was
            required to be circumcised, in conformity with the
            Islamic teachings. But he died due to the surgery
            complications.</p>

            <p>All medical staff, mainly from Fez, were astonished
            at the court's decision.</p>

            <table width="290" align="right" summary="">
              <tr>

                  surgeon in cancerology and digestive and visceral
                  diseases. Ph: Archives</p>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Mohammed Kohen, a specialist surgeon in cancerology
            and digestive and visceral diseases, declared that
            without a technical proof that a surgeon has committed
            a medical error, he is free from guilt.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Any surgical operation is studied,
            well-thought, and then decided. The surgeon values the
            importance of his action and thinks of that before,
            during, and after the operation. He carries with him
            all the anxiety, along with a feeling of satisfaction:
            being at the service of his patients,&rdquo; a surgeon
            from Fez told <i>Morocco Times</i>.</p>

            <p>Asked about the possible complications of adult
            circumcision, Dr. Kohen, who is also president of the
            Moroccan Association for visceral surgery and chairman
            of the &ldquo;Chirurgie Action&rdquo; Association, said
            that <span class="yellow">the surgery becomes very
            risky when it comes to a patient of Privat's age. After
            the circumcision, the involuntary erection of the adult
            can result in a suture detachment and consequently a
            haemorrhage, he clarified.</span></p>
