    <h1>Tissue engineers grow penis - with feeling</h1>

    <p><b>NewScientist.com news service</b></p>

    <p>Tissue engineers who recently demonstrated penis replacement
    in animals have now added a vital missing component - nerve
    cells.</p>

    <p>"The nerve cells are very important - they are responsible
    for all the sensory function," says Anthony Atala, at Boston
    Children's Hospital. "In order to do complete [penile]
    replacements we need to make sure all of the parts are there,
    including the nerves."</p>

    <p>In September 2002, Atala and his colleagues replaced missing
    chunks of penis in live rabbits with tissues grown in the lab.
    But the replacement penile tissues consisted only of muscle and
    endothelial cells, which were inserted alongside intact nerve
    cells. Their new work is the first time that penile nerve
    tissue has been regenerated.</p>

    <p>"This is exciting and extends their work logically in
    several directions," says reconstructive surgeon Hunter
    Wessells of the University of Washington School of Medicine in
    Seattle.</p>

    <p>The regeneration of nerves is an important step towards one
    day creating engineered replacement penile tissue for men who
    have lost parts of the penis following prostate cancer surgery
    or an accident, or to enhance the genitals of children born
    with abnormalities.</p>

    <p><b>Mimicking nature</b></p>

    <p>The secret to regrowing the nerve cells is mimicking nature,
    explains Atala. His team began by building millimetre-wide
    collagen channels. These replicate the sheaths that, like the
    insulation around a bundle of electrical wires, surround nerves
    in the body.</p>

    <p>The team then cut away the nerve cells in the penises of
    live rats and sewed the collagen channels to the severed nerve
    stumps. After three months, functional nerve cells one
    centimetre long had grown inside the channels.</p>

    <p>The physical support from the collagen appeared to be all
    that was needed to coax the nerve cells into growing. The
    collagen-supported cells grew just as well as nerves that were
    grafted on in experiments conducted for comparison.</p>

    <p>The next challenge will be encouraging them to grow to even
    greater lengths without losing their functionality, says
    Atala.</p>

    <p><b>Splice and connect</b></p>

    <p>In the next few years, Wessels envisions using the technique
    to solve the "challenging problem" of returning feeling, or
    just the ability to have an erection, to men with intact
    penises who have lost nerve function.</p>

    <p>Growing nerves in situ could replace the technique of nerve
    grafts, which requires the removal of valuable tissue from
    another part of the body. Nerve grafts were first used in
    penises in 2000.</p>

    <p>But he says it will be closer to 10 years before a
    fully-functional tissue engineered penis is grown in the lab
    and attached to a man or child. That will require overcoming
    the challenge of splicing and connecting nerves in the
    lab-grown penis to the central nervous system, he warns.</p>

    <p>The new research was presented by Atala at the annual
    meeting of the American Urological Association in Chicago on
    Tuesday.</p>
