            <p>June 25 2002 at 06:49PM</p>

            <p>Five boys aged between 13 and 18 were believed to
            have been murdered during a traditional initiation
            process near Heidelberg, Gauteng's East Rand police
            said on Tuesday.</p>

            <p>Spokesperson Annaline Prinsloo said four teachers at
            the initiation school were taken in for questioning on
            Tuesday afternoon.</p>

            <p>Another 18 boys were admitted to hospital after
            suffering from complications as a result of botched
            circumcisions. They had also been beaten up.</p>

            <p>Prinsloo said two of the boys were in serious
            conditions while the others were stable.</p>

            <p><b>'These children are in severe shock'</b></p>

            <p>"These children are in severe shock, their genital
            areas are infected, they have bruises all over their
            bodies and have been out in the cold without any
            clothes," Prinsloo said.</p>

            <p>The first boy, found in the mountainous Ratanda area
            on Monday evening, died on his way to hospital. On
            Tuesday morning, local residents informed the police of
            four more bodies in the area.</p>

            <p>A police helicopter collected the bodies and it was
            established that about 20 more boys who participated in
            the ceremony had gone missing. They later found the 18
            boys hiding in the area.</p>

            <p>The group of Sotho boys were from Orange Grove,
            north-eastern Johannesburg, and had been in Ratanda
            since the beginning of June.</p>

            <p>Post mortems would be conducted to establish the
            cause of death of the five boys. The results are
            expected to be available before Friday.</p>

            <p>Asked whether the police were still investigating
            the possibility that the children had been murdered,
            Prinsloo said: "Definitely."</p>

            <p>She said health authorities indicated that the
            initiation school would be closed down. - Sapa</p>
