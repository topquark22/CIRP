            <h2>The Whale Hunt</h2>

            <h4>Circumcision later in childhood common Korean
            practice</h4>

            <p>Now that the winter vacation is over, elementary
            schools are once again filled with the excited chatter
            and laughter of children. Many of the children talk
            about ski trips and vacations with their parents, but
            not all of them are chattering about the joys of
            youth.<br />
            <br />
             Many of the boy students have returned to school as
            veterans of the "whale hunt," and in somewhat excited
            voices relate their experience to their fellow male
            classmates and juniors. Most of them are probably
            unaware of the controversy that has existed over the
            "whale hunt." It has been argued by some that the
            "whale hunt" is not needed, nor is it a rite of
            passage, but is a somewhat risky custom that has been
            introduced into Korea by the West in the last half
            century.<br />
            <br />
             
            <!--The end : TODAY'S TOP STORIES & FROM THE SECTION -->What
            is the "whale hunt"? The word "whale hunt" in Korean is
            the same word for foreskin, and it has become a clever
            way for young Korean males to express
            circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             Circumcision is relatively new to Korea; its
            introduction is attributed to the American military
            during the late 1940s and following the Korean War. And
            while it may have been extremely rare prior to the
            1940s, we do know that in 1885, Dr. Horace Allen, the
            first Western doctor in Korea, treated seven cases of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phimosis"
            target="_blank">phimosis</a>, probably by
            circumcision.[1]<br />
            <br />
             According to several studies, the vast majority of
            Korean men are circumcised. "Today, at least 95 percent
            of South Korean boys entering middle school have had
            been circumcised. For the other five percent, the
            question is not whether they should give up their
            foreskin, but when they should be
            circumcised."[2]<br />
            <br />
             "More than 90% of South Korean high school boys are
            now circumcised..."[3]<br />
            <br />
             Perhaps a better and more accurate reflection of the
            numbers is given in the study done by Dr. Ku Ja-hyeon
            of the Korean Military Manpower Administration. In 2001
            he examined 1674 young males (20-years-old) and found
            that 78 percent of them were circumcised and an
            additional 11 percent who weren't desired to do so
            soon.[4]<br />
            <br />
             I did my own survey amongst my Korean friends, and I
            must admit some embarrassment on my part, and shock and
            disbelief on my friends' part, when I asked them their
            circumcision status. In hindsight I should have taken
            the advice of one of the editors and gone to the local
            public bath and did my own surreptitious "study."<br />
            <br />
             Of the people I asked, I found all but one was
            circumcised, and the one that wasn't was extremely
            embarrassed that he was uncircumcised. Most had been
            circumcised while in middle school or just prior to
            entering the military.<br />
            <br />
             In the United States, Canada, and parts of Europe,
            circumcision is/was routinely done at birth, but in
            Korea, circumcision is generally done between the ages
            of 9-14. Why do Koreans do it so late, and why in the
            winter? According to a report done by Robert T.
            Francoeur and Yi Hu-so:</p>

            <blockquote>
              "In the 1960s, Korean doctors and advice columnists
              launched a campaign in newspapers and magazines
              urging parents to have their adolescent sons
              circumcised during the long winter break before a boy
              enters middle school. Infections, the Korean doctors
              say, are much less likely if circumcision is done in
              the winter rather than in the summer." [5]
            </blockquote>

            <p>Many African cultures perform circumcision as a rite
            of manhood, and while it may not be, per se, a rite of
            manhood in Korea, 40.6 percent of respondents in Dr.
            Ku's study felt that it was. From personal observations
            and eavesdropping, I have noted that many of these
            young boys who have taken part in the "whale hunt" do
            think of themselves as more manly than their peers who
            have not undergone the knife.<br />
            <br />
             However, there may be another reason. In Ku's study he
            found that more than 80 percent of the men believed
            that it was important for boys to be able to make their
            own choice in the matter, instead of routinely being
            circumcised at birth.<br />
            <br />
             Korea is an extremely socially oriented country --
            everyone must fit in. Those who are different or do not
            fit society's norms are often made into pariahs, and
            thus it is not unreasonable to understand the group
            mentality in being circumcised (young boys often go
            with their friends as a small group to be circumcised)
            and the embarrassment of those who are
            uncircumcised.<br />
            <br />
             A couple of Westerners who are married to Korean women
            that I spoke with also expressed some uncertainty on
            whether or not to have their sons circumcised. Some
            wished to leave their sons uncircumcised but worried
            about the additional stigma that their bi-racial sons
            might suffer from their peers at school.<br />
            <br />
             Many Koreans feel that circumcision is more hygienic,
            "advanced and modern," and cite only the positive
            effects of circumcision. Ironically, many Westerners no
            longer feel that circumcision is needed for proper
            hygienic care.<br />
            <br />
             Even in Korea, where most reports on circumcision are
            positive, there has been at least one study that has
            pointed out a perceived negative aspect of
            circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             A recent <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/sex_function/kim2006/">
            study</a> done by Seoul National University professor
            Kim Dae-sik and JoongAng University professor Bang
            Myeong-geol found that 20 percent of circumcised males
            "felt less sensation during orgasm .... than when they
            had been uncircumcised."[6]<br />
            <br />
             Of course this report was overshadowed by the recent
            U.S. National Institutes of Health study that found
            circumcision may reduce a man's risk of contracting HIV
            through heterosexual sex by half.[7]<br />
            <br />
             It will be interesting to see which study captures the
            attention of Korean men more -- the possible loss of
            sexual satisfaction or the possible increase of sexual
            security.<br />
