            circumcision</h2>

            <p>By MARS W. MOSQUEDA JR.</p>

            <p>CEBU CITY - A 50-year-old man was charged before the
            court here after he allegedly "threatened" to
            circumcise a four-year-old boy.</p>

            <p>Bernardo Ong was charged with child abuse after he
            allegedly instilled fears in the child for his constant
            joking of circumcising him each time he saw the latter,
            said Assistant City Prosecutor Gilberto Batayola.</p>

            <p>The accused is allowed to post a R20,000 bail for
            his temporary liberty.</p>

            <p>Batayola said Ong's constant teasing has
            psychologically affected the child who cries every time
            he sees a pair of scissors in their house because the
            accuse would always show him a pair of scissors
            whenever he makes the teasing.</p>

            <p>The boy's mother had asked Ong many times to stop
            threatening her son with circumcision, but the
            respondent continued with his jokes.</p>

            <p>Batayola said Ong could be held liable under <a
            href="http://www.trafficking.org.ph/resources/phil/downloads/ra7610.htm"
             target="_blank">Republic Act 7610</a>, the law that
            provides special protection for children.</p>

            <p>A psychologist, who was consulted by the boy's
            parents, said the child has been suffering from stress
            due to the threats of the respondent.</p>
