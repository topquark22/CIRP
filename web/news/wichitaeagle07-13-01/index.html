        <h2>Wichitans fight over their son's circumcision</h2>

        <p><b>By Alex Branch</b><br />

      <p>Allowing a doctor to circumcise his newborn son, in Rodney
      Grisham's mind, is the same as letting someone sexually
      assault him.</p>

      <p>But to his wife, Sheila Grisham, not allowing the
      procedure is an assault on her religious beliefs.</p>

      <p>The dispute over whether to circumcise their 9-day-old
      baby could take the two Wichita parents to court next
      week.</p>

      <p>It has already contributed to their separation. And Rodney
      Grisham has gone so far as to file a protection-from-abuse
      order in his son's name in Sedgwick County District Court to
      prevent the procedure. A hearing is set for Thursday. "I
      believe every child has a right to have their genitals left
      alone," said Rodney Grisham, 25.</p>

      <p>His son, Asher Nathanal Grisham, is staying with his
      22-year-old wife, who says her reasons for the circumcision
      are strictly religious.</p>

      <p>"I've talked it over with my pastor and decided that's
      what I want to do," she said.</p>

      <p>Her pastor, <a
      href="http://www.fpcwichita.org/church_staff.htm"
      target="_blank">Marrell Cornwell</a> of <a
      href="http://www.fpcwichita.org/" target="_blank">First
      Pentecostal Church</a> in Wichita, is baffled by the dispute,
      calling it the first he's heard of between parents in his
      congregation.</p>

      <p>He has had several conversations about circumcision with
      Rodney Grisham, he said, but could not sway him.</p>

      <p>Although Cornwell doesn't think circumcision is necessary
      for salvation, he said, it is still important. "It's a part
      of our Judaic-Christian heritage," Cornwell said. "And it's a
      very strong part."</p>

      <p>In circumcision, an anesthetic usually is applied to the
      penis, and the foreskin is cut away.</p>

      <p>A <a href="/library/statements/aap1999/">statement</a>
      released two years ago by the <a href="http://www.aap.org/"
      target="_blank">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>, which had
      been neutral on the subject for years, declared that
      circumcision carries few medical benefits and is generally
      unnecessary.</p>

      <p>However, the academy suggested families continue to follow
      their personal preferences, including religious
      traditions.</p>

      <p>Rodney Grisham doesn't see how personal preference can
      outweigh the pain that such a procedure must cause an
      infant.</p>

      <p>And he can't stand the idea of standing by and watching
      someone inflict that kind of pain on his son.</p>

      <p>If, when his son is 12, 13 or 14 years old, he decides for
      himself that he wants to be circumcised, then that's fine,
      Rodney Grisham said.</p>

      <p>He was circumcised as a child. But that's no reason for
      his son to go through the same thing, he said. "I think it
      could really traumatize a baby," he said. "And I can't go
      through with that."</p>
