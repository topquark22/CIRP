            <h2>Sex Life Not Good? Sue!<br />
             Lawyer David Llewellyn Is the Johnnie Cochran of the
            Circumcised</h2>
            By Gersh Kuntzman<br />
             NEWSWEEK WEB EXCLUSIVE 

            <p><b>Feb. 26 - William Stowell enjoys sex. But he
            doesn't enjoy it as much as he thinks he should. So
            he's doing what any red-blooded American male would do
            when dissatisfied with his sex life: He's suing the
            hospital where he was born.</b></p>

            <p>A COUPLE OF months ago, Stowell filed a civil suit
            claiming that <a
            href="http://goodsamaritan.chsli.org/index.html">Good
            Samaritan Hospital</a> in West Islip, N.Y., permanently
            deprived him and his future bedmates of "the pleasure
            of natural, normal sexual intercourse" thanks to an
            "excruciating" 10-minute procedure it conducted on him
            moments after birth. You may have heard of this
            procedure. It's called circumcision. Now, a lot of
            lawsuits come across my desk, but this one caught my
            eye (among other organs). I mean, here was a
            circumcised guy complaining that he was unable to
            satisfy his female partners because he lacked his
            foreskin. Well, I lack foreskin, too. And, come to
            think of it, I've always secretly suspected that my
            sexual partners were just being nice when they told me
            I was the "greatest" "lover" they ever "had." Could
            this circumcision thing be the excuse I've sought for
            years? In a word, yes!</p>
            <hr size="1" color="black" />

            <p><b><i>"I'm being deprived of my birthright. Studies
            show that I would be enjoying it more and my partners
            would be enjoying it more. Every time I have sex,
            that's in the back of my head."</i><br />
             - WILLIAM STOWELL</b></p>
            <hr size="1" color="black" />

            <p>"I'm being deprived of my birthright," Stowell told
            me. "Studies show that I would be enjoying it more and
            my partners would be enjoying it more. Every time I
            have sex, that's in the back of my head." (Thanks a
            lot, William; now it's in the backs of the heads of all
            my circumcised readers.) Stowell is just a test case
            for a new niche of personal-injury caselaw being carved
            out by Atlanta lawyer <a
            href="http://firms.findlaw.com/llewellynlaw/practices.htm">
            David Llewel[l]yn</a>, who has become to the
            anti-circumcision camp what Johnnie Cochran is for
            celebrities accused of horrendous, made-for-TV crimes.
            More than a decade since the first "wrongful
            circumcision" case, Llewel[l]yn has been increasingly
            successful at winning settlements ($65,000 in a 1995
            case, for example) and blocking unwanted
            circumcisions.</p>

            <p>In the current case, Llewel[l]yn will argue that
            Stowell's mother, Linda, was handed a consent form
            while she was still under the influence of post-
            caesarean painkillers. Linda Stowell told me that, as
            an Italian Catholic, she never would've agreed to
            having her son circumcised. It must have been the
            Demerol speaking.</p>

            <p>But Llewel[l]yn wants his pound of flesh. He's
            hoping that the Stowell case goes to trial so he can
            use it as a pulpit to spread the anti-circumcision
            gospel. For a circumcised guy like me, talking to
            Llewel[l]yn for even a few minutes was a remorseful
            trip through a sex life that might have been.</p>

            <p>For one thing, Llewel[l]yn cites evidence that
            circumcision-which he claims causes such pain in the
            infant that "heartbeat and cortisol levels [rise] to
            levels consistent with torture"-makes kids more
            susceptible to pain later in life. And, naturally, he
            has studies that indicate that uncircumcised men enjoy
            sex more than circumcised men do-and, more importantly,
            more than I do.</p>

            <p>But his most compelling evidence ("evidence" because
            it appeared in the very fancy <i>British Journal of
            Urology</i>, "compelling" because it directly relates
            to me) is the argument that women enjoy sex less when
            they're having it with a circumcised male.</p>

            <p>Foreskinologist Kristen O'Hara's <a
            href="/library/anatomy/ohara/">study</a> of 139
            women-all of whom had partaken of penises of both
            varieties-revealed that women were twice as likely to
            have an orgasm, half as likely to experience pain
            during sex and nearly twice as likely to enjoy the
            experience with an uncircumcised man.</p>

            <p>Oh, and by the way, the study also showed that
            circumcised men were more likely to prematurely
            ejaculate. (If you're circumcised, O'Hara's study is
            like getting a "Dear John" letter from a girlfriend
            doing a semester abroad in Spain. Ouch.)</p>

            <p>I could get very graphic here-O'Hara certainly does,
            which I like in a scientific paper-but the upshot is
            that there's a lot of physics, hydraulics, plate
            tectonics and basic animal biology that results in
            women's greater enjoyment of sex with unaltered
            men.</p>

            <p>She even cites the great Jewish philosopher <a
            href="/library/cultural/maimonides/">Moses
            Maimonides</a>, who wrote in the 12th century that
            "circumcision weakens the faculty of sexual excitement
            and.diminishes the pleasure"-a worthy goal, Maimonides
            wrote, lest everyone would be having sex all the
            time.</p>

            <p>"Clearly," O'Hara concluded, "the anatomically
            complete penis offers a more rewarding experience for
            the female partner." She even has a just-released book
            called "Sex As Nature Intended It" that is sure to do
            two things: 1) bring a great deal of attention to
            circumcision and, 2) make me feel worse than I already
            do.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Stowell said he's had trouble explaining
            his lawsuit to his circumcised Air Force buddies. "They
            think that as long as they can have an orgasm, they're
            fine," he said. "But there's more to sex than that."
            There is? Now he tells me.</p>
