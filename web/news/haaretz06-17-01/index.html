      <h2>'Circumcision is abuse'</h2>
      <i>By Nitzan Horowitz</i> 

      <p>Sweden has passed a new law, the first of its kind in the
      world: Circumcision will take place only in the presence of a
      doctor and only with the use of a "pain-killer" administered
      by the medical man. From New York, the <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.wjc.org.il/">World Jewish Congress</a> is
      accusing Sweden of placing the first legal restriction in
      Europe since the Nazi period on a Jewish religious
      practice.</p>

      <p>"The circumcision of children is a cruel and very painful
      operation," explains Professor Yngve Hofvander, formerly the
      head of <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.uu.se/Adresser/Directory/deps/X41.html">International
      Maternal and Child Health</a> at <a target="_blank"
      href="http://info.uu.se/presengl.nsf">Uppsala
      University</a>.</p>

      <p>The law was passed after two Muslim boys died after being
      circumcised. The circumcision of boys, writes Hofvander,
      "contravenes the UN <a
      href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">Convention on the
      Rights of Children</a> and should be called mutilation, just
      like female circumcision is now ... There has been a mindless
      fear about calling things by their correct name, due to the
      risk of offending religious groups. It took some years before
      one was able to call female circumcision, mutilation - but
      now this term is officially sanctioned."</p>

      <p>The <a href="/news/aftonbladet02-09-01/">case</a> that
      caused a storm in Stockholm was heard this year in court. A
      Muslim boy was circumcised by a private practitioner. He
      screamed with pain for several hours, and received an
      injection of a pain-killer, apparently in the wrong dosage.
      After some time, he stopped breathing and died.</p>

      <p>Hofvander says that circumcision is a medically pointless
      operation, as it removes healthy tissue from a healthy body
      part, and therefore no complications from this operation are
      acceptable. "And yet a child becomes a victim in a ritual
      that is characterized by demands made by adults." The child,
      he adds, has no way of defending himself apart from trying to
      escape and screaming.</p>

      <p>After the law was passed, the debate has been focused on
      its interpretation. Deputy Foreign Minister Michael Melchior,
      who has a rabbinical-Scandinavian background, gets to the
      heart of the matter: "The original proposal for the law was
      formulated in coordination with community, but it was changed
      and now it says that the painkiller must be given only by a
      doctor or a nurse. This would be acceptable to the community.
      But there are certain people who are interested in a strict
      interpretation who say that if only a doctor is allowed to
      administer the painkiller, this means a local intravenous
      anesthetic, because otherwise a ritual circumciser could
      apply an anesthetic ointment. If the intravenous
      interpretation prevails, a problem of Jewish law will
      develop, and medically, too, such anesthesia could be
      dangerous."</p>

      <p>The Swedes are aware of the fact that the circumcision of
      boys is not considered an unacceptable norm. However, they
      are going their own way as trailblazers, just as they have
      done in other social fields.</p>

      <p>Hofvander argues that even if millions of boys are
      circumcised every year, this does not mean that their parents
      are right. "Many millions of girls are sexually mutilated
      annually - are their parents right or wrong?" he writes.
      "Many millions of Chinese girls had their feet bound so that
      they did not develop - were their parents right or wrong? It
      was the custom to beat children (with support from
      authorities, including pronouncements in the Bible!) - were
      their parents right or wrong?" He notes that with the
      development of principles of justice, these practices are no
      longer tolerated. Now, he declares, "The time has come to
      seriously question male circumcision and mutilation."</p>

      <p>By October, the Swedish <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.sos.se/sos/nytt.htm">government</a> will
      have to publish regulations concerning the most controversial
      aspect of the implementation of the law: Does "painkiller"
      mean a local anesthetic? The Jewish organizations are
      worried. The Swedish foreign minister has promised Melchior
      that her government will make effort to coordinate the matter
      with the Jewish community.</p>

      <p>The World Jewish Congress expected that Israel would
      discuss this with the Swedish prime minister during his visit
      here last week. In Jerusalem they preferred to discuss other
      matters with Goran Persson, who currently holds the rotating
      presidency of the EU. Persson says he was not even asked
      about this in Israel, but remarked that had he been asked, he
      would have said that he too is opposed to the new law.</p>
