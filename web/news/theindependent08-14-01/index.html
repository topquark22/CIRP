      <h2>Circumcisions 'were botched by retired doctor'</h2>
      <b>By Lorna Duckworth</b><br />
       Social Affairs Correspondent<br />
      14 August 2001 

      <p>A GP pressurised two mothers into having their baby sons
      circumcised by a surgeon he knew, who botched the operations
      and caused them excruciating pain, a General Medical Council
      (<a href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/" target="_blank">GMC</a>)
      hearing was told yesterday.</p>

      <p>Dr Michael Harbinson gave the mothers no choice about who
      would perform the operation when he referred them to Peter
      Silverstone, a retired obstetrician and gynaecologist he had
      known for years, the GMC's professional conduct committee
      heard.</p>

      <p>Mr Silverstone, who was paid from Dr Harbinson's GP
      fund-holding budget, had done religious circumcisions but had
      "insufficient" medical experience. He failed to anaesthetise
      either boy properly, causing them both to scream
      uncontrollably. Later one of the boys bled for several hours
      after he was sent home and needed two stitches to his penis,
      the GMC committee was told.</p>

      <p>Dr Harbinson, a GP, of Rowlands Gill, Tyne and Wear, and
      Mr Silverstone, of Newcastle upon Tyne, both deny serious
      professional misconduct by providing sub-standard treatment
      to patients before, during and after operations.</p>

      <p>Zoe Johnson, counsel for the GMC, said Dr Harbinson
      encouraged the parents to have their six-month-old boys
      circumcised and did not explain alternative treatments.</p>

      <p>"He presented the case as a fait accompli. He didn't give
      the parents choices in procedure and choices in the type of
      surgeon when he referred them to Mr Silverstone.</p>

      <p>"It appears there was some sort of arrangement whereby Dr
      Harbinson paid Mr Silverstone out of his GP fund- holding
      budget. Mr Silverstone was insufficiently experienced in
      circumcision for medical purposes."</p>

      <p>The first mother, referred to as Mrs A, consulted Dr
      Harbinson at his surgery in Stanley, Co Durham, about cysts
      under her son's foreskin.</p>

      <p>The GP insisted on circumcision because the cysts could
      have led to infection, the GMC hearing was told.</p>

      <p>But during the operation in 1998, Mr Silverstone "failed
      to ensure the boy had appropriate analgesia", Miss Johnson
      said.</p>

      <p>"As she [Mrs A] waited she heard her son screaming as if
      in agony. The screaming went on for 20 to 25 minutes without
      interruption until Mrs A was invited into the treatment room
      and handed her son.</p>

      <p>"A was taken home but the screaming continued. He would
      eventually fall asleep but would wake up screaming."</p>

      <p>Every time the second mother, Mrs B, took her son to Dr
      Harbinson's surgery, he would try to persuade her to have him
      circumcised, Miss Johnson told the hearing.</p>

      <p>When the boy caught a urinary infection, Mrs B finally
      agreed to the operation, believing it was "her only
      choice".</p>

      <p>But Mr Silverstone "failed to provide adequate analgesia
      and allowed the boy to go home without stopping the
      bleeding", Miss Johnson said.</p>

      <p>The boy had screamed so much during the operation that he
      developed a purple rash from his chest to his forehead. Later
      that day Dr Harbinson and Mr Silverstone visited Mrs B, and
      applied two stitches to the baby's penis to stem the
      bleeding.</p>

      <p>Miss Johnson said that although Mr Silverstone was
      practised at performing religious circumcisions, he had no
      experience in such operations for medical purposes.</p>

      <p>Mr Silverstone also denies allegations that he failed in
      his treatment of two women on whom he performed
      hysterectomies, the details of which will be heard at a later
      date.</p>

      <p>The hearing into the treatment of the two boys, being held
      in London, is expected to last two weeks.</p>
