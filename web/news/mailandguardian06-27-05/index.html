            circumcisions</h2>
            Johannesburg<br />
             <i>27 June 2005 12:14</i> 

            <p>Fifteen boys have been admitted to the Tshilidzini
            hospital in Limpopo after botched circumcisions, the
            Limpopo Health Department said on Monday.</p>

            <p>Department spokesperson Phuti Seloba said the boys
            were admitted after they were found in a serious
            condition at an illegal private clinic at Ha-Ramukhuba
            in the Vuwani district near Thohoyandou on Sunday
            afternoon.</p>

            <p>"The department got a tip-off about an illegal
            circumcision school and went to investigate. That's
            when they found the boys," said Seloba.</p>

            <p>"They are now in a critical but stable condition and
            we believe that they will be out of danger soon."</p>

            <p>Sebola called on parents to act responsibly and take
            their children to properly registered circumcision
            schools.</p>

            <p>"The department is tired of this kind of
            irresponsible behaviour from parents.</p>

            <p>There are registered, fully functioning circumcision
            schools in the province and parents are aware of them,"
            he said.</p>

            <p>"Workshops were conducted in the province to educate
            parents about the schools, but it seems they prefer
            backdoor circumcisions which are very dangerous and
            painful."</p>

            <p>Seloba said the department was investigating
            possible ways to deal with people operating illegal
            circumcision schools. - Sapa</p>
