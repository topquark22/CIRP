            <h2>Row over `soft circumcision'</h2>
            22/01/2004 12:58 - (SA) 

            <p>Florence - A proposal by a hospital in Florence to
            offer its female patients from Africa a toned down
            version of genital mutilation has sparked a nationwide
            debate in Italy.</p>

            <p>Omar Abdulkadir, a Somalian gynaecologist who heads
            the <a href="http://www.ao-careggi.toscana.it/"
            target="_blank">Careggi hospital</a>'s centre for the
            prevention of female genital mutilation, has proposed
            substituting the traditional African rite of
            infibulation with a needle prick on a child's
            clitoris.</p>

            <p>"An anaesthetic ointment would be used and only a
            drop of blood would be spilled. In this way, the ritual
            would be preserved, but with no pain or damage,"
            Abdulkadir was quoted by <a
            href="http://www.repubblica.it/" target="_blank">La
            Repubblica</a> daily as saying.</p>

            <p>Local representatives from African countries say the
            proposal, which is being backed by Tuscany's regional
            government, seeks to accommodate African immigrants who
            refuse to give up the rite.</p>

            <p>"Simply being against infibulation is not enough,"
            local representatives wrote in a letter sent to
            Tuscany's health authorities.</p>

            <p><b>Useless and cruel</b></p>

            <p>"While some of us understand that this practice is
            useless, cruel and not prescribed by our religion,
            others are still too attached to their culture and see
            the rite as the best possible thing for their
            daughters," the authors said.</p>

            <p>The proposal, however, has been strongly criticised
            by <a
            href="http://www.culturadimpresa.org/chi/Profili/lussana.htm"
             target="_blank">Carolina Lussana</a>, a <a
            href="http://www.leganord.org/"
            target="_blank">Northern League</a> lawmaker who has
            drafted a bill seeking to outlaw what is sometimes
            referred to as "female circumcision".</p>

            <p>"Infibulation, however soft and painless, is still
            an act of unacceptable violence, both physical and
            moral, which damages defenceless children," she told
            the Ansa news agency.</p>

            <p>Lussana said female genital mutilation is "a
            barbarous practice" that must be eradicated rather than
            a "tradition to be respected".</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.who.int/en/"
            target="_blank">World Health Organisation</a>, which at
            1979 conference in Sudan condemned the mutilations as
            disastrous to women's health and as indefensible on
            medical as well as humane grounds, estimates that more
            than 120 million African women have been subjected to
            the practice. - Sapa-dpa</p>
