            <h4>Maine Times' view, written by its editor</h4>

            <h2>Just Like Dad</h2>

            <p>It's a puzzling phenomenon: despite a broad
            consensus among medical practitioners that circumcision
            is an unnecessary and probably undesirable procedure,
            its incidence in Maine, far from disappearing, is
            actually increasing. Even more puzzling: The rise is
            not occurring in what we often think of as the
            "culturally conservative" areas of Northern Maine,
            where it remains below 50 percent of newborns - but in
            the urban centers, with one of the steepest rises
            occurring at the state's largest hospital, Maine
            Medical Center in Portland.</p>

            <p>Something doesn't add up here. Almost all the family
            practitioners interviewed by Maine Times condemned the
            non-religious practice of infant circumcision, and few
            obstetricians defended it, except as a personal
            choice.</p>

            <p>Except that the person involved isn't making that
            choice. Instead, parents, apparently led by fathers who
            want their sons to look like them, are insisting on a
            surgery which has no demonstrated medical value and
            clearly imposes pain on the newborn and possible
            negative consequences afterwards. Bluntly put, this is
            narcissism at its worst.</p>

            <p>Doctors say they are neutral on the subject, but
            circumcision's rising rate in Maine, even as it is
            falling nationally, suggests they are doing little to
            inform patients about circumcision. They should do so,
            well in advance of the actual birth. Another change
            that might help: Medicaid should stop paying for the
            procedure; few private insurers do, classifying it,
            appropriately, as optional cosmetic surgery. No, it
            doesn't cost a lot, but Medicaid desperately needs
            funding for better preventative and pre-natal care.
            Every little bit helps, particularly if it comes from
            de-funding a procedure without measurable medical
            benefits.</p>

            <p>Perhaps everyone would benefit from more
            straightforward, unembarrassed talk about circumcision.
            Americans can be awfully squeamish about anything to do
            with sex, however tangentially - and thus remain
            ignorant. Men who desire circumcision can choose it
            themselves; imposing it on newborns is dubious at
            best.</p>
