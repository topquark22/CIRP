            <h2>CIRCUMCISION PERSISTS DESPITE DOCTORS'
            DISAPPROVAL</h2>

            <p>By Sharon Bass<br />
            Deputy Editor</p>

            <p>[See also: <a href="editorial.html">Editorial]</a></p>

            <p>The newborn boy is typically 24 hours old when he is
            brought into a hospital treatment room and placed on a
            molded, plastic table where his arms and legs are held
            down by Velcro straps. A doctor then tightens a clamp
            around the tip of the baby's penis, squeezing the
            foreskin up and over. Then with a scalpel, a one-inch
            high tubular piece of tissue is severed. The clamp is
            left on for five to six minutes afterwards to keep the
            arteries constricted and stop the bleeding. All the
            while, the baby cries, screams, turns red and his heart
            races.</p>

            <p>Because of the pain and trauma associated with this
            procedure, called circumcision, and the alleged health
            benefits have been found questionable, more and more
            physicians are reluctant to perform it. And some will
            not do it at all.</p>

            <p>"I think the history of it in itself is pretty
            appalling," said Burtt Richardson, a pediatrician in
            Winthrop, who did circumcisions during medical training
            but refuses to do them now. "Performing a painful
            procedure on a newborn is assaultive and inhumane."</p>

            <p>While many doctors today either share Richardson's
            attitude, or say that circumcision is not medically
            called for, the majority of parents in Maine and
            nationally still opt to have their sons snipped. The
            number one reason, according to both doctors and
            parents, is so son will look like father and his male
            peers.</p>

            <p>Bangor pediatrician John Farquhar tries to explain
            the ongoing popularity of circumcision by saying: "Old
            traditions die hard. If everybody cut off their left
            ear, then that's something that would probably
            continue," too - even though in this country, the only
            one where circumcision is routinely performed for
            non-religious reasons, the custom is barely two
            generations old.</p>

            <p>The last time Norridgewock family practitioner
            Kenneth Baker excised a newborn's - or anyone's -
            prepuce was 18 years ago. "In my mind, I knew this
            wasn't right; the pain I was causing. I was removing
            healthy tissue," he said. When Baker's son was born 11
            years ago, the foreskin was left intact.</p>

            <p>Bethany Hays, a Yarmouth obstetrician-gynecologist,
            who had done the surgery since 1974 but stopped last
            year, calls circumcision "the most common, unnecessary
            surgical procedure done in the United States. God put
            that skin there for a reason. Why the heck are we
            taking it off?"</p>

            <p>Hays and most other physicians are skeptical that
            there are any substantial health benefits. While there
            is evidence that uncircumcised males have a higher risk
            of urinary tract infections, those infections
            themselves are pretty rare and benign in men. And
            penile cancer, which does show some statistical
            correlation, is even rarer leading doctors to believe
            it's not worth the risk of circumcision.</p>

            <p>Baker said studies have shown that in Europe, where
            newborn circumcision is rarely performed, only one in
            1,000 adult males requires the procedure, often due to
            infection brought on by diabetes. The penile cancer
            rate is about one in 100,000 - lower than for male
            breast cancer.</p>

            <p>In the United States, amputating babies' foreskins
            became routine after World War II, after many
            prospective soldiers flunked physicals and interest in
            public health techniques grew. Both Jews and Muslims
            perform circumcision as part of religious beliefs. But
            in this country cosmetic reasons predominate.</p>

            <p>"Our feelings was," said Stephen Harris, of
            Cumberland, a father of a circumcised son, "we'd rather
            have him look like dad and the boys in the locker
            room." But he made that decision eight years ago.
            Today, Harris maintains, "If I knew then what I know
            now, I never would have done it. I mean, why don't we
            just remove their appendix?"</p>

            <p>Nationally, the growing consensus against the
            procedure has had some effect. As recently as the
            1980s, roughly 90 percent of baby boys were
            circumcised; by last year it dropped to 60 percent.
            Maine numbers seem to have risen slightly, from 64
            percent in 1985 to 69 percent last year, according to
            the Maine Health Care Finance Commission. The figures
            may be affected by a larger number of hospitals
            reporting. Still, no one questions that circumcision is
            more the rule than the exception in Maine.</p>

            <p>The Preference of parents for circumcision persists
            even though doctors rarely recommend it and the
            procedure is usually paid for out-of-pocket; few
            private health insurers cover it. Even doctors who
            continue to circumcise doubt its medical necessity.
            Portland obstetrician Tom Sunshine said that while
            penile cancer only occurs in uncircumcised men - some
            disagree - he also said, "I don't think we can make a
            strong case" for circumcision for health reasons.</p>

            photo]</i></p>

            <p>Francis Kleeman, a urologist in Biddeford who's been
            circumcising boys of all ages for 30 years, agrees. "A
            lot of it is personal choice. I don't feel strongly
            that every male [has] to be circumcised." The number
            one reason his patients choose to do so, he said, is to
            make son look like father.</p>

            <p>Ponee Roberts' son was circumcised when he was born
            last month, even though the Gorham mother said she was
            against it: "Why do it? I figured the foreskin was
            there for some reason. But the main reason [for not
            doing it] was the pain." However, Roberts lost out as
            her husband insisted on having it done.</p>

            <p>Since circumcision is classified as a cosmetic
            procedure, most insurers will not cover the $100-$150
            cost. In an interesting twist, however, Medicaid - the
            federal-state program for low-income Mainers - does pay
            at $88 per baby. Dr. Timothy Clifford, Medicaid's
            medical director, said "It's always been a
            controversial issue." But Medicaid has always
            reimbursed, despite growing doubts about the
            procedure's usefulness.</p>

            <p>When Greg Thompson, a Falmouth family practitioner,
            had his first son he had him circumcised. But then he
            said he developed some "social concerns" and withheld
            the scalpel with his next three sons. He's also
            withholding it in his practice; he last did the surgery
            in 1987 when he was an intern. "They're not medically
            necessary," he said. "Kids scream when you do it. I
            don't think it damages their psyches, but..."</p>

            <p>Others are more vehement. Falmouth obstetrician
            Bethany Hays subscribes to William Reich's theory,
            saying the "trauma stays in the body," and even goes so
            far as to equate the emotional effects of the penile
            surgery with the effects of childhood sexual abuse.
            Reich, an early follower of Freud who summered in the
            Rangely area, was an outspoken opponent of
            circumcision. Though many experts in psychology find
            Reich's theories of "orgone energy" half-baked, he
            continues to have followers.</p>

            <p>In addition to the lack of apparent health benefits,
            circumcision opponents argue that it sharply decreases
            sexual pleasure. Dr. Kenneth Baker says that
            circumcision removes nerve endings, and that the
            foreskin provides a gliding, "very pleasurable" action
            during intercourse. And he cites reports of males
            circumcised as adults indicating a "tremendous loss of
            pleasurable sensation."</p>

            <p><a href="mailto:nocircofmaine@aol.com">Suzanne
            Cook</a>, founder of the <a
            href="http://members.aol.com/nocircofmaine/"
            target="_blank">Maine chapter</a> of the <a
            href="http://www.nocirc.org/"
            target="_blank">Circumcision Information Resource
            Centers</a>, a national anti-circumcision group,
            agrees. The 24-year-old woman has two sons; neither are
            circumcised. "It's not just a little snip of skin,"
            said Cook. "Studies show that the baby is traumatized
            for 48 hours." She talks about men who go through
            primal therapy, where the unconscious is untapped, and
            say they recall the "terror" of their
            circumcisions.</p>

            <p>While doctors may not buy into the theory that
            circumcision leaves emotional scars, they agree that it
            hurts, contrary to earlier theories that newborns can't
            feel pain. Most physicians use an anesthetic. Portland
            pediatrician Steven Blumenthal said he suggests it to
            obstetricians who circumcise his prospective patients:
            "The babies seem less stressed when anesthetized."</p>

            <p>The anesthetic of choice is lidocain, similar to the
            dentist's Novacaine. It doesn't always work, however;
            the problem is in reaching all of the millions of nerve
            cells.</p>

            <p>Dr. John Farquhar of Bangor said that while he does
            perform circumcisions on request, he feels "there's no
            medical necessity" for them. "To me, the only valid,
            strong feeling for doing it is a religious one."
            Adverse reactions can include excessive bleeding and
            infection. Twice, in 25 years, he's had to put a newly
            circumcised baby on intravenous antibiotics.</p>

            <p>Complications, though rare, can be serious. The
            now-abandoned practice of using electro-cautery - an
            electrical instrument that stops bleeding during
            surgery - with circumcision resulted in a few cases
            where serious infections developed requiring amputation
            of the entire penis and a sex-change operation, said
            obstetrician Hays. "We forget," she said, "that every
            kind of surgical procedure has risks."</p>

            <p>Risks and pain coupled with what most agree is an
            unnecessary operation drove Kenneth Baker years ago to
            require parents to watch a circumcision, either
            videotaped or live, before he'd agree to perform one on
            their son. No one ever did. Baker, who has joined the
            advisory board of Cook's anti-circumcision group, said
            "That tells us something if they're not willing to
            watch."</p>
