    <h2>Circumcision not routinely recommended,<br />
    new policy says.</h2>

    <h4>Pediatricans say the procedure has benefits and
    risks,<br />
    and unbiased information should be given to parents.<br />
    Critics predict the procedure will become less common.</h4>

    <p><b>Washington</b> When the American Academy of Pediatrics
    issued its first statement on circumcision in 1971, the rate of
    infant boys in the United States getting the procedure was at
    an altime high: 85% to 90%. Since then the procedure has
    dropped to about 64%</p>

    <p>Thanks to the academy's newest statement - which says that
    the medical benefits are not sufficiently compelling to
    recommend circumcision as routine newborn procedure - Ronald
    Goldman, Ph. D, says he expects to see the rate decrease
    further. And nothing could make him happier.</p>

    <p>Dr. Goldman heads the Boston-based Circumcision Resource
    Center and is author of <i>Circumcision: The Hidden Trauma.</i>
    In recent years, he and an increasing number of others have
    mounted an increasing campaign propounding the benefits of the
    "intact" male and questioning the cultural and medical
    assumptions that lead, according to one critic, to the
    "equivalent of amputating a finger to avoid a hangnail."</p>

    <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics is well aware of the
    divisive nature of the procedure. Carole M. Lannon, MD, MPD,
    chair of the AAP's task force on circumcision, said this issue
    has drawn more response than any other the 55,000-member group
    has dealt with in recent years.</p>

    <p>So, in light of the debate over the procedures risks and
    benefits, she said, the academy decided to review the medical
    literature that was published on the topic since it issued its
    last statement in 1989.</p>

    <p>Though none of the five statements issued since 1971
    recommended routine circumcision, its pre-1989 ones stated that
    there was no absolute medical indication for it.</p>

    <p>Its 1989 statement, however, cited new research that
    suggested circumcised males have fewer urinary tract infections
    and were at less risk for sexually tranmitted diseases. It
    concluded that the procedure had potential benefits, as well as
    risks, and said parents should be told of both before informed
    consent was obtained.</p>

    <p>Studies show that during the first year of life,
    uncircumcised males have - at most - a one in 100 chance of
    developing a urinary tract infection, whereas circumcised males
    have about a one in 1,000 chance.</p>

    <p>Research also indicates that uncircumcised men are more than
    three times more likely to get penile cancer than circumcised
    men. But according to the AAP, the cancer is very rare, with
    only nine or 10 cases per 1 million men diagnosed per year.</p>

    <p>Research also indicates that circumcised males may be at
    reduced risk for STDs, the AAP, in its latest statement,
    concluded that "behavioral factors continue to be far more
    important in determining a person's risk of contracting
    sexually transmitted diseases than circumcision status."</p>

    <p>Circumcision critics, including medical broadcaster, Dean
    Edell, MD, point out that the United States is the only country
    that routinely circumcises newborn males. They note that
    Australian, British and Canadian medical societies discourage
    the practice and that about 85% of the rest of the world is
    uncircumcised.</p>

    <p>In addition, they say removal of the foreskin is unnecessary
    because it repairs no abnormality or removes no diseased tissue
    and is mutilating and because it robs the penis of its
    protective cover. Opponents say circumcision removes erogenous
    tissue and cite studies that claim uncircumcised men and their
    partners have more rewarding sexual experiences.</p>

    <p>The new statement stops short of advising against the
    procedure. In fact, it says, "it is legitimate for parents to
    take into account cultural, religious, and ethnic traditions,
    in addition to medical factors, when making this choice."</p>

    <h3>Pain relief "essential"</h3>

    <p>The statement also recommended - for the first time - that
    pain relief be provided. Studies show that infants are
    receiving analgesia less than half of the time, Dr. Lannon
    said.</p>

    <p>There is "considerable evidence," the report states, "that
    infants circumcised without analgesia experience pain and
    physiologic stress.</p>

    <p>The report will be reviewed by the American College of
    Obstetricians and Gynecologists, whose members do the most
    hospital-based circumcisions. Pediatricians and family
    physicians are the other common providers. And in the Jewish
    community, religious ritual circumcisions are frequently
    performed by mohelim.</p>

    <p>Critics are hoping insurers - most of whom, with the
    exception of Medicaid, cover the procedure - will stop paying
    for elective circumcisions.</p>

    <p>According to Daniel Gollagher, author of the
    soon-to-be-published book, <i>Circumcision: History of the
    World's Oldest Surgery</i>, when the procedure stopped being
    covered by Britain's National Health Service after World War
    II, the rate of circumcision dropped in the United Kingdom from
    about 50% to less than 5%.</p>

    <p>But U.S. insurers won't pull the plug on funding soon.</p>

    <p>Chris Martin of the Chicago-based Blue Cross Blue Shield
    Assn., which covers one out of every four Americans, said that
    most of the insurers' 52 independent plans routinely cover
    elective circumcisions. He said that some will look at the new
    AAP position and discuss it, but he didn't predict any
    immediate change in policy.</p>

    <p>Beverly Hayon of California-based Kaiser Permanente said the
    HMO routinely pays for the procedure and has no plans to drop
    the coverage.</p>

    <p>Peter D. Rappo, MD, a Brockton, Mass., pediatrician said he
    always offered unbiased information about the procedure. But in
    22 years of practice, "the breakdown has always been about 70%
    circumcised, 30% uncircumcised." He predicted the statement
    "may provoke more discussion but won't affect the numbers.
    "People don't come in waffling on this one."</p>

    <p>Where he does expect to see change is in the pain control
    arena. And he said it will be the parents who force the issue.
    Although studies show most physicians still don't anesthetize
    the infant prior to the procedure, Dr. Rappo said he suspects
    the report will push the issue forward.</p>

    <p>Though Dr. Rappo said he expects the numbers to stay about
    the same. Dr. Goldman predicted a decline. The AAP's earlier
    statements "didn't get the kind of front-page attention this
    statement is getting. This is ever getting on the late-night
    talk shows."</p>
