            <h2>Circumcision study lands into problems</h2>

            <p><b>By ARTHUR OKWEMBA</b></p>

            <p>The <a
            href="http://www.kenyattanationalhospital.org/"
            target="_blank">Kenyatta National Hospital</a> Ethical
            and Research board is uncomfortable with a study just
            months after it authorised a local researcher to
            circumcise adult males at Kisumu to establish whether
            there is a correlation between circumcision and HIV
            transmission.</p>

            <p>Sources say the researcher ran into trouble when the
            board began thinking he was betraying some of the
            agreed aspects of the research.</p>

            <p>It immediately - last October - named a committee to
            investigate. The team finished its work early the next
            month, according to board secretary Prof A.
            Quantai.</p>

            <p>But Prof Quantai would not reveal the findings,
            saying the board must first meet to discuss them.</p>

            <p>She said: "We are going to take a position on the
            matter by the second week of January. What people need
            to know is that corrective measures are being taken for
            the mistakes made."</p>

            <p>However, informed sources claimed the board's
            concern was that those involved in the research had
            altered an approved questionnaire without its
            knowledge.</p>

            <p>There is also some worry about the number of people
            already circumcised and about exporting volunteers'
            specimens abroad for further analysis.</p>

            <p>Although local scientists have been known to do such
            exportation in good faith, it is said their foreign
            counterparts take advantage of such specimen to carry
            out unauthorised research.</p>

            <p>And, in the event, they often make medical
            breakthroughs that benefit only their countries and,
            through patents, only themselves.</p>

            <p>Asked for comment, Prof Ndinya Achola, principal
            investigator in the study, says he cannot comment since
            the matter is confidential and under consideration by
            the board.</p>

            <p>Prof Achola says: "I have explained the science of
            the study clearly to the board and they were
            comfortable. For the ethics of the study is something
            we left to them to decide and I cannot comment on it
            when they are still looking into the matter."</p>

            <p>This revelation is the latest in a study that has
            generated a lot of interest and debate among
            researchers. Many have questioned its whole safety and
            ethics.</p>

            <p>What preoccupies some of them is that, if
            circumcision is not hygienic, it can cause
            complications, which have killed some men.</p>

            <p>Prof Achola has since argued that, in their study,
            they use doctors and clinical officers to carry out the
            circumcision. Besides, their activities are being
            supervised by Kenyan and American Data Safety
            Monitoring (DSM) experts.</p>

            <p>The study, which began six months ago, seeks to find
            out whether circumcised men are less likely than
            otherwise to be infected with the HIV.</p>

            <p>More than 300 young males have been circumcised
            since it began. The study requires them to be sexually
            active, aged between 18 and 25 and be HIV-negative.
            They will be monitored for two years immediately after
            being circumcised.</p>

            <p>More than 600 young men out of the expected 2,000
            have volunteered since the study began. Interest has
            been beyond the researchers' expectations.</p>

            <p>A number of scientists, however, claim that people
            are being given incentives to take part and being made
            to believe they are HIV-proof once circumcised.</p>

            <p>According to Prof Achola, although volunteers get
            free medical attention whenever ill, no incentives are
            given to lure them into participating.</p>

            <p>He insists the issue of the volunteers thinking they
            are insulated from HIV infection has been thoroughly
            tackled. He is aware, says he, that, after
            circumcision, some young men may engage in unsafe sex
            thinking they are safe.</p>

            <p>"Our approach is to educate them on HIV/Aids and we
            emphasise to them that no authoritative evidence has
            been produced to indicate circumcision reduces HIV
            infection, he stresses.</p>

            <p>The study, funded by America's <a
            href="http://www.nih.gov/" target="_blank">National
            Institutes of Health</a>, is said to be the first in
            the world that attempts to come up with hard data on
            correlations between HIV infections and
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>South Africa initiated its own a few weeks ago and
            Uganda plans to launch one soon. HIV experts think
            that, if the studies prove the hypothesis, then they
            will provide evidence for circumcision to be added to a
            list of public interventions in preventing
            HIV/Aids.</p>

            <p>A few weeks ago, in an interview, Prof Achola
            insisted that all he wants is to verify earlier
            studies, which just compare HIV infection rates between
            communities circumcising men and those that do not.</p>

            <p>He says: "We want to provide evidence based on
            practical results to justify or refute what other
            studies involving the comparison of untested phenomenon
            say."</p>

            <p>HIV experts have also demanded that studies be done
            to produce hard data showing a relationship between
            circumcision and HIV infection, especially in Africa,
            where three quarters of the world's victims are claimed
            to live.</p>

            <p>What has spurred interest in the whole issue are
            indications of circumcised males with low viral loads
            showing less likelihood of transmitting the virus to
            their female partners.</p>

            <p>However, the same scientists have been confronted
            with cost and ethical issues, raising a lot of
            reservations about the whole approach to managing
            HIV/Aids.</p>

            <p>James Ntozi, a <a href="http://www.makerere.ac.ug/"
            target="_blank">Makerere University</a> lecturer, has
            warned of money being diverted from other social needs
            to meet circumcision costs. Or, if the exercise is
            donor-dependent, then the programmes might not
            work.</p>

            <p>In one its issues, <i>The Horizons</i>, a research
            organ of the <a href="http://www.popcouncil.org/"
            target="_blank">Population Council</a>, has raised
            fears that, in that case, "men may use their
            circumcision status as a reason for not using condoms,
            while women may be less inclined to insist on condom
            use if their male partners are circumcised."</p>

            <p>"In this scenario," it adds, "women are in increased
            risk of contracting the virus and this may reduce the
            potential benefits of male circumcision on HIV
            transmission."</p>

            <p>Another fear is that the rate of female genital
            mutilation (FGM) in areas where the practice exists may
            shoot up if men's circumcision is linked to HIV
            prevention.</p>

            <p>Equally emotive arguments have raised ethical
            questions about the age at which a person needs to be
            circumcised for the practice to be effective.</p>

            <p>There are worries that older men may be left out in
            the strategy, since studies elsewhere in Africa show
            that circumcision, as a measure against HIV infection,
            is more effective if done before or soon after puberty
            begins.</p>

            <p>In a 1999 research on the age of male circumcision
            and HIV infection risk in rural Uganda, Kelly Kiwanuka
            found that males circumcised before puberty - between
            13 and 20 - had a much reduced risk compared with their
            uncircumcised counterparts.</p>
