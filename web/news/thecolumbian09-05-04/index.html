            hospital</h2>

            <p>Sunday, September 5, 2004<br />
             <b>KELLY ADAMS and JOHN BRANTON Columbian staff
            writers</b></p>

            <p>A Ridgefield man was arrested on suspicion of
            first-degree assault of a child after he allegedly
            attempted to circumcise his 8-year-old son.</p>

            <p>Clark County sheriff's Sgt. Tony Barnes said the
            man, whose name is being withheld to protect the
            victim's privacy, claimed reading the Bible led him to
            try to circumcise his child Friday night.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">The man, believed to be in his
            30s, took the boy into the bathroom and used a hunting
            knife for the procedure, Barnes said.</span></p>

            <p>"When he couldn't stop the bleeding, he called 911,"
            Barnes said.</p>

            <p>Firefighters arrived to begin treatment while
            deputies took the man into custody. He remained in the
            <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/sheriff/custody/Index.html"
             target="_blank">Clark County Jail</a> on Saturday
            night.</p>

            <p>The child was taken to <a href=""
            target="_blank">Southwest Washington Medical
            Center</a>, where he received several stitches. Barnes
            said the case will be referred to <a
            href="http://www1.dshs.wa.gov/basicneeds/an2cps.html"
            target="_blank">Child Protective Services</a>. CPS has
            been the family's home before to check on the nine
            children living there.</p>

            <p>The victim's mother was home at the time of the
            assault, Barnes said, but it was not clear if she knew
            what the father was doing. She rode with the boy to the
            hospital.</p>

            <p>"Just when you think you've seen everything," said
            Barnes, a 20-year law enforcement veteran. "This is
            just bizarre."</p>
