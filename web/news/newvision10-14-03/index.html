            <p><a

            target="_blank">President Yoweri Museveni</a> has
            threatened to stop the cultural practice of
            circumcision, which he said had <span
            class="yellow">endangered the lives of youths through
            the spread of HIV/AIDS.</span></p>

            <p>Museveni was on Sunday evening addressing youth
            leaders from the 10 eastern districts during a workshop
            on HIV/AIDS. "If necessary, we can stop circumcision. I
            do not care about losing votes. I cannot look for votes
            from people who may die tomorrow after getting infected
            during the circumcision rituals," Museveni said.</p>

            <p>The workshop, organised under the "Presidential
            Initiative on aids Strategy for Communicating with
            Young People, was held at Mbale secondary school.</p>

            <p>More than 1,000 youth leaders from Kaberamaido,
            Soroti, Katakwi, Kumi, Busia, Tororo, Kapchorwa,
            Pallisa, Mbale and Sironko attended the workshop
            organised by the youth desk in State House and the
            Uganda Aids Commission.</p>

            <p>Resource persons at the workshop included the former
            Big Brother Africa (BBA) housemate, Gaetano Kaggwa
            Juuko, and presidential advisers, Moses Byaruhanga and
            Dr. Jesse Kagimba, a senior presidential advisor on
            HIV/AIDS.</p>

            <p>Museveni said he could be prompted to organise
            medically qualified personnel to carry out public
            circumcision to protect interests of the community
            where it was practiced.</p>

            <p>He directed officials from the <a
            href="http://www.aidsuganda.org/"
            target="_blank">Uganda Aids Commission</a> and those
            from the Aids control Programme to attend the
            circumcision ceremonies to identify dangers that it
            posed.</p>

            <p>Museveni said circumcision in Bugisu and Sebei was a
            danger to the candidates since some 'surgeons' did not
            sterilise their knives in a medical manner.</p>

            <p>Museveni added that he might be forced to avail
            doctors to carry out the circumcision, provided it was
            done in a clinical manner.</p>
