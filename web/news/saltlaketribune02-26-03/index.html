            <h2>GOP Brass Cobbles Together Plan to Balance the
            Budget</h2>
            BY DAN HARRIE<br />
             THE SALT LAKE TRIBUNE 

            <p>Republican leaders of the Utah Legislature have come
            up with a budget-balancing plan that relies on a raft
            of spending cuts and selective tax increases.</p>

            <p>The new draft plan released Tuesday proposes
            eliminating sales tax breaks for newspapers, cable and
            satellite television services and roadside fruit
            stands. Those hikes would generate $10.2 million.</p>

            <p>Also being floated as part of the shortfall-plugging
            package are the $2.1 million in increased revenues from
            imposing a tax on the state's largest credit unions,
            $5.3 million from hiking taxes on hazardous and
            low-level radioactive waste, and $8 million from a plan
            to salvage the state inheritance tax even as the
            federal estate tax is phased out as part of the Bush
            tax cuts.</p>

            <p>"After 24 months of budget cuts, we've dealt with
            shortfalls of $630 million and we're really down into
            muscle now," said Senate Budget Chairman Leonard
            Blackham, R-Moroni.</p>

            <p>"Something has to give," said Blackham, adding the
            proposed tax increases and fee hikes are, taken as a
            whole, "pretty modest. If we don't do something,
            education is going to take a significant hit."</p>
            Blackham and House Budget Chairman Ron Bigelow, R-West
            Valley City, cautioned that the proposal is "a
            preliminary one." 

            <p>"When we say this is a draft we really mean it. It
            is changing already," said Bigelow.</p>

            <p>But the budget document is the clearest guide yet to
            how the Legislature will meet its constitutional
            mandate to bring the $7 billion-plus spending package
            into balance with revenues by midnight March 5.</p>

            <p>Under the outline, lawmakers would restore funding
            to some of the agencies and programs that had been
            targeted for 2 percent reductions in the latest round
            of committee hearings. Medicaid would get increased
            funding of around $32.8 million -- about what Gov. Mike
            Leavitt recommended, but $20 million short of what
            low-income advocates said was needed to take care of
            critical needs in the state-run health insurance
            program.</p>

            <p>If approved, the plan would cancel the proposed
            ouster of around 6,000 patients from the program slated
            next month by tightening the eligibility
            requirements.</p>

            <p>Lawmakers, though, are proposing to <span
            class="yellow">eliminate Medicaid benefits for infant
            male circumcisions</span> and chiropractic services.
            Also spared from the chopping block is the Department
            of Corrections Lone Peak facility, meaning there should
            be no early releases of prisoners.</p>

            <p>The Utah State Fair will not lose half its
            approximately $400,000 in state funding, as originally
            proposed. But lawmakers are proposing to cut by 2
            percent the operating budget of the Department of
            Alcoholic Beverage Control for a savings of $327,000.
            They also are proposing to siphon $5.5 million in
            tobacco settlement funds into the general fund in the
            current budget cycle.</p>

            <p>On the revenue side of the plan, legislators are
            proposing to raise fees for liquor licenses, and an
            array of professional licenses.</p>

            <p>The tax increases contemplated in the plan come from
            several bills already in the works.</p>

            <p>Proposed elimination of sales tax exemptions for
            newspapers, pay TV and fruit stands are attributed to a
            bill sponsored by Sen. Ed Mayne, D-West Valley
            City.</p>

            <p>But Mayne said the Republican leadership plan
            doesn't reflect his bill, which proposes doing away
            with a laundry list of special-interest tax breaks
            totalling $54 million. Mayne's bill would impose taxes
            on everything from ski resort power bills to prepaid
            telephone calling cards to vending machine sales to
            machinery and equipment for new or expanding
            manufacturing businesses.</p>

            <p>"If these special interest tax breaks aren't
            repealed the citizens are going to see tax increases or
            fees, and that's not fair," said Mayne.</p>
