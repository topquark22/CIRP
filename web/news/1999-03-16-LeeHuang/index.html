    <title>HIV-Killing Proteins Found in Tears</title>

    <h2>HIV-Killing Proteins Found in Tears</h2>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have found that tears, saliva
    and pregnant women's urine contain proteins that are powerful
    killers of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. 

    <p>[CIRP Note: <i>Lysosyme is also found in subpreputial
    moisture.</i>]</p>

    <p>In a <a
    href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/lee-huang/">study</a>
    published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
    Sciences, scientists found that a protein called lysozyme was
    able to kill the AIDS virus quickly in test-tube
    experiments.</p>

    <p>Sylvia Lee-Huang of New York University, lead researcher in
    the study, said the protein could become an important drug
    against HIV because it is a natural compound that the body
    routinely makes in tears and saliva.</p>

    <p>"It ought to be more tolerated and have fewer side effects
    than other HIV drugs," said Lee-Huang. "It possibly could be
    used in combination with other drugs."</p>

    <p>It's not known how lysozyme kills HIV, but Lee-Huang
    speculated that it could work by breaking down the outer
    membrane of the virus.</p>

    <p>The team also found that the urine of pregnant women
    contains another type of protein, called ribonucleases, that
    destroys the genetic material in the HIV virus.</p>

    <p>Nava Sarver, an AIDS researcher at the National Institute of
    Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the study was interesting
    but needs to be confirmed by other laboratories.</p>

    <p>"A lot of work needs to be done to simulate the (laboratory)
    findings in a more relevant situation," said Sarver. Her
    agency, NIAID, is part of the National Institutes of
    Health.</p>

    <p>The search for the anti-HIV protein was prompted, said
    Lee-Huang, when researchers realized the babies of women
    infected with HIV were somewhat protected from the virus.</p>

    <p>Researchers earlier suspected that human chorionic
    gonadotropin, or HCG, a hormone produced during pregnancy, was
    responsible for protecting against HIV and other viruses.</p>

    <p>Lee-Huang said she and her group purified HCG and found it
    had no effect on HIV. The researchers then spent two years
    isolating other proteins in urine and testing them against HIV.
    Eventually they found lysozyme and ribonucleases.</p>

    <p>The researcher speculated that pregnancy prompts a woman's
    body to make more virus-killing proteins to protect the
    developing baby from viruses and bacteria. That suggests
    "Mother Nature knows best how to protect the earliest stages of
    life," Lee-Huang said.</p>

    <p>The proteins also were found in mother's milk, white blood
    cells and chicken egg whites.</p>

    <p>The presence of lysozyme in saliva may be a factor in why
    HIV is not transmitted by casual kissing, said Lee-Huang.</p>

    <p>The team is trying to determine exactly how lysozyme attacks
    HIV. That is a critical step in developing a new HIV drug based
    on the protein, she said.</p>
