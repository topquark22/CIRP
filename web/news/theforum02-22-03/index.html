            <h2>Fight doesn't scare Baer: Circumcision battle
            latest for 'crusader of underdog'</h2>

            <p>By Jeff Baird<br />
             <a
            href="mailto:jbaird@forumcomm.com">jbaird@forumcomm.com</a></p>

            <p>The Forum - 02/22/2003</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a> spent 500 hours, or
            about $75,000 in billable time, working on the
            circumcision lawsuit against <a
            href="http://www.ci.fargo.nd.us/visitor.htm"
            target="_blank">Fargo</a>'s <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Hospital</a> and one of its
            doctors.</p>

            <p>And, as he prepares to ask for a retrial of the
            suit, which ended Feb. 14, it's a tab that is going to
            grow.</p>

            <p>So why circumcision? Why, of all the causes for Baer
            to take up, has he taken such a passionate interest in
            the most common medical procedure in the nation?</p>

            <p>Publicity? Money? A bad circumcision experience?</p>

            <p>None of the above, the <a
            href="http://www.hawley.govoffice.com/"
            target="_blank">Hawley</a>, Minn., attorney said.</p>

            <p>This issue is personal for Baer. He likens the
            struggle to stop infant circumcision to the civil
            rights battles of the 1960s, in that he is fighting
            against a mindset that is so engrained most people
            refuse to question its purpose.</p>

            <p>"If people want to criticize this as grandstanding
            or making my mark, they can," the 51-year-old said.
            "But I'm not going to apologize for looking out for the
            best interest of 1-day-old babies."</p>

            <p>People who know Baer best - know where he came from
            and where he has been - aren't at all surprised by his
            persistence.</p>

            <p>"He is not one to shy away from something because it
            may be a difficult obstacle to overcome," said Amon
            Baer, one of Zenas' 10 brothers. "He also enjoys the
            challenge of breaking new legal ground."</p>

            <p>Baer, who also has four sisters, spent the first
            seven years of his life in a <a
            href="http://www.hutterites.org/"
            target="_blank">Hutterite</a> community near <a
            href="http://www.grandforksgov.com/"
            target="_blank">Grand Forks</a>, N.D.</p>

            <p>In 1958, his parents moved to <a
            href="http://ns1.americus-online.com/"
            target="_blank">Americus</a>, Ga., to a commune that
            stressed racial integration.</p>

            <p>"Whites and blacks were encouraged to work together
            as equals," Baer said.</p>

            <p>It was a philosophy that wasn't widely embraced in
            the South at that time. The "colony" was shot at and
            firebombed in the year the family lived there.</p>

            <p>Americus was also Baer's first experience at a
            public school.</p>

            <p>He remembers riding on a bus with kids that didn't
            belong to the commune. He was bombarded with racial
            epithets.</p>

            <p>"As an 8 year old, I didn't know what was going on,"
            Baer said.</p>

            <p>The family moved to another commune in Pennsylvania
            in 1959, an experience Baer calls the most bizarre of
            his childhood.</p>

            <p>The group purported "following in the footsteps of
            Christ." The reality, however, was much different, Baer
            said.</p>

            <p>"The whole purpose was to make you a sheep of the
            community," he said.</p>

            <p>As their parents worked, the kids sat quietly in a
            large room with only molding clay to play with.</p>

            <p>An adult watched to ensure silence.</p>

            <p>The Baer's were kicked out of the commune for
            challenging the group's authority after his dad asked
            why the leaders weren't more involved in work
            chores.</p>

            <p>"Within a weeks the leaders came to him and said
            they didn't think the 'spirit of God' was moving him in
            the right direction," Baer said.</p>

            <p>The family of 15 was given $300, a station wagon and
            told to leave.</p>

            <p>The Baer's returned to Grand Forks, greatly shaken
            by their experience.</p>

            <p>"My mother and father never formally joined any
            church after Pennsylvania," Baer said.</p>

            <p>Baer's dad took odd jobs before he borrowed enough
            money to buy a farm near Hawley and eventually started
            a successful chicken egg farm.</p>

            <p>Baer graduated from Lake Park High School in 1969,
            as Vietnam raged.</p>

            <p>He was allowed to sit out the war as a conscientious
            objector, working instead for three years at a
            Minneapolis hospital.</p>

            <p>At night he went to school at the <a
            href="http://www1.umn.edu/systemwide/indexsys.shtml"
            target="_blank">University of Minnesota</a> where he
            graduated in 1976 with degrees in German literature and
            political science.</p>

            <p>He entered law school hoping to pursue a career in
            politics, but later determined he could do more good in
            law.</p>

            <p>In his 23 years as an attorney, Baer has never shied
            away from controversial court cases.</p>

            <p>He has sued cities, counties, two states and the
            U.S. government.</p>

            <p>He has been involved in murder trials, police
            brutality lawsuits and was recently hired by parents in
            the Barnesville School District to sue the <a
            href="http://www.barnesville.k12.mn.us/Graphic%20Page%20Only/School%20Board/schoolboard.htm"
             target="_blank">school board</a> for illegal
            meetings.</p>

            <p>His case selection has earned him a reputation as a
            crusader for the underdog, and at times has put him at
            odds with another of his clients - the <a
            href="http://www.hawley.govoffice.com/"
            target="_blank">City of Hawley</a>, longtime Hawley
            City Councilman John Young Jr., said.</p>

            <p>"Although there where times it wasn't always the
            most comfortable for us, we came to the understanding
            that was his niche," Young said.</p>

            <p>Baer became involved with circumcision in 1995.</p>

            <p>In the case a mother and father were divided on
            whether their son should be circumcised, Baer said. The
            doctor circumcised the child.</p>

            <p>At first, Baer, who is circumcised, thought "what's
            the big deal."</p>

            <p>Then he began researching infant circumcision and
            concluded it is a procedure in which the medical risks
            greatly outweigh the benefits and is only perpetuated
            by the medical field because it is profitable.</p>

            <p>At the same time, the North Dakota <a
            href="http://www.state.nd.us/lr/"
            target="_blank">Legislature</a> had just passed a law
            that made female circumcision illegal.</p>

            <p>"When I became a lawyer, I had to take an oath I
            will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United
            States of America and <a
            href="http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/cco/rules/mncon/preamble.htm"
             target="_blank">Minnesota</a> and <a
            href="http://ranch.state.nd.us/LR/cencode/Const.pdf"
            target="_blank">North Dakota</a>," Baer said. "I can't
            look the other way when I see constitutional violations
            just like those in the 1960s civil rights movement
            didn't. There were principled individuals who said this
            is wrong and society must change."</p>

            <p>Baer brought the case forward, but a federal judge
            ruled it had no standing.</p>

            <p>His latest circumcision lawsuit pitted <a
            href="http://www.zbaer.com/anita.htm"
            target="_blank">Anita Flatt</a> of <a
            href="http://www.hawley.govoffice.com/"
            target="_blank">Hawley</a> against Fargo-based <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Hospital</a> and <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734"
             target="_blank">Dr. Sunita Kantak</a>.</p>

            <p>Flatt, an attorney at Baer's <a
            href="http://www.zbaer.com/" target="_blank">law
            firm</a>, signed a circumcision consent form but
            claimed she and husband, James, weren't told complete
            and accurate information about removing the foreskin
            from their son's penis.</p>

            <p>It took a <a href="http://www.co.cass.nd.us/"
            target="_blank">Cass County</a> jury about two hours to
            wade through two weeks of testimony and find Kantak's
            care not negligent.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/COURT/DISTRICTS/EC.HTM"
             target="_blank">East Central District</a> Court Judge
            <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/Rothe-Seeger.htm"
             target="_blank">Cynthia Rothe-Seeger</a> dismissed
            MeritCare</p>

            <p>from the lawsuit.</p>

            <p>Baer said he will ask Rothe-Seeger for a retrial
            based on her decisions not to allow him to show the
            jury videos showing circumcision, tools used in the
            procedure and pictures of an uncircumcised penis.</p>

            <p>If the retrial is not allowed, Baer said he will
            appeal to the North Dakota <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/"
            target="_blank">Supreme Court</a>.</p>

            <p>He has the support of his family.</p>

            <p>"To me it is not quirky at all," said Baer's wife
            Julia. "It is something that I think is a very
            appropriate subject to bring up."</p>

            <p>She said if parents knew more about the procedure,
            fewer people would have their children circumcised.</p>

            <p>But hospitals aren't anxious to provide that
            information, said <a
            href="http://www.marshfieldclinic.org/provider/detail.asp?ID=32941"
             target="_blank">Dr. Christopher Cold</a>, one of two
            expert witnesses to testify for Baer in the Flatt
            lawsuit.</p>

            <p>"This is a $250 million a year industry," he said.
            "He is trying to expose that as a less than ethical
            endeavor."</p>
