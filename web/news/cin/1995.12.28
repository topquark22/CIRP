THE YEAR 1995 IN REVIEW
This year, so much progress has been made, and so many events have taken
place, that I have decided to approach this year's summary a little
differently.  Rather than choosing the top ten developments -- a difficult
task, indeed -- or trying to list them in chronological order, I will divide
them into categories.  I would say we've made much more progress this year
than ever before, but I'm afraid that I would sound like a broken record.  I
apologize in advance for any omissions.  -The Editor.

*Organizations formed:  Intact Men Against Circumcision (IMAC) is founded by
Ken Derifield.  Jewish Associates of CRC is founded by Ron Goldman.  12 June:
 The Nurses of St. Vincent announce their founding of Nurses for the Rights
of the Child at a press conference.  The Fall/winter issue of the NOCIRC
Newsletter announces Physicians for the Rights of the Child, founded by

restoration and our movement.  June:  Natural Health magazine finally gets it
right (for the most part), after having ignored the issue.  7 Sept.:  Rolling
Stone magazine helps get the word out about our movement.  November:  Cambio
16, "The Newsweek or Time of the Spanish speaking world," prints a lengthy
article about our cause.  Later, La Presse, the most widely read French
newspaper in Quebec, prints a lengthy, informative article about circumcision
and our movement.  

*Documentaries:  4 September:  "It's a Boy," a powerful, shocking documentary
on ritual circumcision is aired in England.  November:  NOHARMM's historical,
provocative and truthful documentary on circumcision, "Who's Body, Who's
Rights?" is completed.

*Successful lawsuits/settlements:  21 July:  A hospital in Alabama is
successfully prosecuted and fined for circumcision of a boy without parental
consent.  November:  A clinic in New York agrees to pay a $1.2 million
settlement to an 8-year old immigrant who's ritual circumcision at age three
was botched, leaving him severely mutilated.

*Known deaths/excessive mutilations:  18 July:  A 5-year-old boy dies of
circumcision in Texas.  Also in July:  One boy dies and 12 others are
hospitalized in South Africa as a result of ritual kidnapping and
circumcision.

*Demonstrations, marches, and other actions:  15 February:  Pro-circumcision
advocate Edgar Schoen is challenged at a conference at Kaiser Permanente
Hospital in Oakland, California, by educated anti-circumcision activists.  8
April:  Activists stage a protest, which gains international attention, at an
AAP convention in Philadelphia.  8 May:  Activists protest at Moscone Center
in San Francisco supporting Dr. Sorger's  resolution against routine
circumcision.  30 May - 4 July:  Activists participate in and protest at the
Child Health 2000 conference in British Columbia.  27-29 July:  Activists

circumcision.  The attendance of this action was the highest ever.  13-18
October:  Richard DeSeabra attends an AAP Conference in San Francisco,
raising important issues and finding support within the medical community.
 Meanwhile, activists demonstrated outside and passed out literature.

*Other events/developments:  In a truly historic moment, The Nurses of St.
Vincent Hospital of Santa Fe, New Mexico, are officially and legally
protected by contract from being forced to participate in circumcision.
 April:  Skin clones using infant foreskins (a project of Advanced Tissue
Sciences) are widely reported in the media.  10 April:  Nurses in British
Columbia at their annual conference agree to address circumcision, overcoming
last year's suppression of the issue.

*Bump in the road:  (As reported in Australian Pediatrics, 10 Oct.:):  The
Australian College of Paediatrics revises its policy on circumcision, taking
a softer, more ambiguous stance.

ARTICLES REQUESTED
Contributed by steven_svoboda@sfbayguardian.com (Steven Svoboda)
I'm an attorney and am in the process of researching in preparation to write
an article or possibly co-write a book on circumcision.  Anyone who knows of
any articles on the subject with relevance to human rights or legal issues,
please contact me.  I have found the easiest to find articles but believe
there are more out there.   Articles on female circumcision are much easier
to find; I've come across several dozen of them.  Thanks! 

SCREAM OF THE WEEK 
(Statements Documenting Infant Circumcision Pain)
Submitted by Johnny4444@aol.com

"[Circumcision] is a stressful and painful event ...with ...changes in heart
rate, respiratory rate, transcutaneous pO2, adrenal cortical hormone
secretions, sleep patterns, and behavioral patterns during and/or following
circumcision. Indeed, circumcision has been recommended as a model for
studying pain in the neonate, and its effects are suggested to be long
lasting."  (Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics, Vol. 5, No. 5, October
1984)
