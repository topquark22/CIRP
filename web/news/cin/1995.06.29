HOW THE PENIS LOSES SENSITIVITY WHEN CIRCUMCISED
Contributed by medical student Franc Garcia, franc@gun.com
Considerations:
In terms of sensitivity loss, infant circumcision results in greater overall
loss of sensitivity and sexual function than does adult circumcision. So even
though the testimonials of men circumcised in adulthood regarding loss of
sensation in the penis is compelling, let's remember that those circumcised
in infancy have lost even more.

The Triple Whammy:
The circumcised penis loses sensitivity in three ways:

1. Loss of the foreskin nerves themselves As has been demonstrated by studies
such as the one by Dr. Taylor and by the testimonials of the majority of
intact men, the inner foreskin possesses a greater density of nerve endings.
It is thought to be more erogenous than even the glans. The is no question
that the foreskin is a highly erogenous tissue. This tremendous amount of
sensitivity is lost completely when the forefold of the skin system is
amputated. In addition to this, the most sensitive part of the penis, the
frenulum of the foreskin, is either partially or totally removed in most
infant circumcisions. The frenulum is the continuation of the inner foreskin
which attaches to the underside (ventral part) of the glans. Thus, a
significant percentage, if not the majority, of erogenous nerve supply to the
penis is removed in circumcision at birth. 

2. Damage to the glans
The erogenous sensitivity that remains after circumcision is primarily in the
glans. This is further reduced by removal of the protective foreskin which
leaves the glans permanently exposed.  Unlike the shaft of the penis, and
most of the rest of the body, the head of the penis, does not posses its own
attached skin. This structure, like the eye ball and the gums of the mouth,
is a somewhat naked structure. Its surface is non-keratinized, like that of
the gums, the eye ball, and the clitoris in women. That means that it  does
not posses a protective thick covering like the keratinized skin of the outer
penile skin system. Like the gums and the eye ball, the glans of the intact
penis has a retractible skin covering. The skin covering of the glans IS the
foreskin. The eyelid is very similar in architecture to the foreskin. If the
eyelid were removed and the eyeball were to become keratinized, you'd have a
much harder time seeing. The same is true of the glans. It becomes
artificially keratinized (dry, hardened, discolored, and wrinkled) as a
result of permanent exposure, and thus less sensitive. Because most American
men are circumcised and have a glans of this nature, it is harder to notice
the abnormality. But just compare the glans of an intact man with that of a
circumcised man next to each other and you'll notice a big difference. Thus,
in addition to removing lots of erogenous nerve endings in the inner foreskin
and frenulum, circumcision further desensitizes the remaining sensitivity of
the glans by leaving it exposed.

3. Loss of skin mobility
The nerve endings in the glans are predominantly complex touch receptors also
known as mechanoreceptors. This is different from the light touch receptors
of the skin which detect surface friction. The mechanorecptors are best
stimulated by massage action rather than surface friction. Thus, the glans is
best stimulated to feel pleasure by a rolling massage action. With an ample
and highly mobile skin system that rolls over the glans with pressure from
the opposing surface, this optimal stimulation of the glans is achieved while
avoiding direct friction of the delicate glans surface. Direct friction tends
to fire off pain receptors causing irritation and also causes further
keratinization of the glans. With the skin system of the penis significantly
reduced by circumcision, the mobility is essentially gone and now the penis
is a static mass with no dynamic self stimulation mechanism. Now, it must be
rubbed. Direct friction is now the primary form of stimulation. So then
circumcision further reduces erogenous sensitivity in the penis by reducing
skin mobility and thus the ability to use the foreskin to massage the glans.
The combination of foreskin and glans in concert results in an even higher
level of stimulation which is unknown to the circumcised male.

CONCLUSION:  Circumcision of an infant male significantly reduces erogenous
pleasure potential in his penis when he becomes sexually active and continues
to be reduced as he ages until, in many cases, he is left with relatively
little sensation.

EXCERPTS FROM AN INTERVIEW WITH DR. DEAN EDELL
Question:
Why do you think [circumcision persists]?

Answer:
Many practices persist in societies that are not questioned, and the
essentially barbaric mutilation of infant boys has been one of them.  Because
I'm Jewish I have no compunction about taking on the whole issue.  If I
wasn't Jewish I'd be accused of being a Nazi because of my position.  But a
lot of the pro-circumcision urologists are also Jewish.  That's like talking
to the pope about birth control.  Those doctors ought to be up front that it
is their religion they feel is being threatened.
