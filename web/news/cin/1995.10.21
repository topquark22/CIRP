AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS GREETED IN SAN FRANCISCO
Contributed by W.H.
The demonstration against the AAP on Saturday 14 Oct at Moscone Center
took place as planned.  We had about 25 demonstrators and our sense of it
was that we were again successful.  We had the usual mix of reactions,
ranging from "right on!" to guilty looks and the occasional snicker, but
many more doctors said they supported our position than said the reverse. 
Also, we got a Bay Area "first" since we were picked up by KPFA Radio who
essentially read our "charges" against the AAP on the air. 

Richard DeSeabra is doing a fantastic job as a lobbyist on the inside.  He
has personally thrust documents into the hands of committee members,
personally talked to all of them (I believe), personally stood up to ask
embarrassing questions in question/answer periods. 

MED SCHOOL OPPRESSION
Contributed by med student Franc Garcia, franc@thoughtport.com
[Editor's note:  Here's one in time for Halloween.  Are there any other
experiences of readers to be shared?  Anonymity will be respected on
request.]

The indoctrination of doctors starts early.  In the first year of medical
school Gross Anatomy is taught.  I remember wondering why the clitoral
hood (foreskin) was discussed in detail but the male foreskin was
deliberately omitted.  In fact, the dissection manual for the laboratory
directed students to immediately cut away the foreskin of their cadaver if
it was present. Only then could the lesson on the anatomy of the penis
continue.  I was reprimanded for suggesting that this part of the body
should be covered in the course.  It was never mentioned.  This is the
only time that Anatomy is taught in detail. 

In histology, the study of tissues, the tissue of the glans (corpus
spongiosum) was discussed briefly.  Even though it was obvious to everyone
that the question of an epithelial covering of the glans remain
unexplained (because of course, that would be the foreskin), the subject
was avoided.  An important point made in histology is the few places in
the body where epithelial tissue abruptly changes from one type to
another, for example, the cervix and the gastroesophageal juncture.  Even
though the foreskin tip is the most visible and clearest examples of such
an epithelial juncture, it was ignored and the foreskin was never
mentioned. 

Still in the first year, the course on human sexuality showed and
explained the penis always as circumcised.  When I approached the
professor who taught the male sexual dysfunction section about why he was
not discussing lack of sensitivity and iatrogenic anomalies of the penis
due to poor circumcision he because hostile and said "the only mention
I'll be making of foreskin is to warn students that the video we will be
viewing shows an uncircumcised man. I'll mention it ahead of time for
those students who may be offended or disturbed by seeing a foreskin."  He
then prohibited me from asking any foreskin-related questions in the
subsequent lecture. 

On to second year:  This is the year when students learn about pathology
-- the study of disease.  Here, I was taught that penile cancer occurs
five times more often in intact men.  No mention of the actual incidence
of the cancer, or of injuries from circumcision, etc.  I was ignored when
I wrote a letter to the professor asking him to present a balanced view. 
By now, I was branded by the school as that pesky guy who keeps getting in
the way of our their promotion of circumcision. 

In epidemiology we were taught that AIDS is more likely to spread in
populations where men are uncircumcised.  This information was not given
as a theory or even as unproven, but as fact. 

On the national boards exam, students are asked about circumcision and
cancer of the penis.  And if you don't answer to the effect that
circumcision prevents it, you get that wrong -- something that is
absolutely not an option for any medical student. 

Third year:  Now, here is the typical medical students, deprived of any
accurate anatomical knowledge of the penis, told that circumcision
prevents caners and AIDS, and now they are asked to perform an infant
circumcision procedure.  Their training to do this?  Nothing more than
previous reading the night before on how to use a gomco clamp or
plastibell.  If the student objects, he/she will lose points, or may even
face disciplinary measures or even fail that rotation.  The procedure is
performed in front of other horrified students.  But they must grin and
bear it, and in the process they have completed their final step in
becoming a defender of circumcision or at least completely indifferent to
the practice. 

That's been my experience.  I'm sure that others may have a different
story. 

DONATIONS REQUESTED FOR FILM
A message for NOHARMM Founder Tim Hammond;
Contributed by Wayne Hampton
Dear NOHARMM Supporter:

I'd like to update you on the status of "Whose Body, Whose Rights?" (which
consistent feedback tells me is a more inviting title than "Men Began to
Scream"). 

Completion of this landmark video is anticipated by 15th November only if
we can count on you to help us raise in the next few weeks the $4000 we
need to bring this out of post-production and into the distribution phase. 
This is my last and most urgent appeal for a generous donation to help us
complete this vital project. 

A preview of this video was shown to a PBS affiliate in Northern
California and they were so impressed with the quality and content of
"Whose Body, Whose Rights?" that they are interested in airing it and
putting it out to PBS affiliates nationally.  The Casting Couch Theater in
San Francisco is also eagerly anticipating the video's completion so they
can promote a 4-day Northern California premiere.  Several universities
have also expressed interest in using the video in human sexuality, ethics
and sociology classes. 

Like all ambitious projects however, inevitable time delays and cost
overruns have caused the video budget to erode faster than anticipated, no
matter how much I've tried to "pinch pennies".  That's why I'm turning to
you as one of the Movement's most tireless supporters to ask for funds to
help push us past the finish line.  Of course any donation you make will
be put to excellent use, but as we approach the end of this project and
the end of the tax year, I am appealing for a minimum donation of $100
before November 15th (tax deductible when paid to NOCIRC). 

I guarantee you this will be one of the wisest investments you'll ever
make. It is an investment in the health, the safety, and the rights of
children. Please help us to raise a voice that wasn't there for us; a
voice to defend those too small to defend themselves. 

In Unity for the Children,
Tim Hammond
