The purpose of this weekly 1000-word bulletin is to educate the public about
and to protect children and other non-consenting persons from genital
mutilation.  Readers are encouraged to copy and redistribute it, and to
contribute written material.  --Rich Angell, Editor.

A MESSAGE FROM THE EDITOR
This will be the last issue of the CIN until further notice.  I will be in
Europe attending the Fourth International Symposium on Sexual Mutilations in
Lausanne, Switzerland (9-11 August), and visiting friends.  I leave 1 August
and return 15 September.  I will terminate my AOL account before I leave and
find another provider after my return.  

R.N. CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS TO INFANT CIRCUMCISION:  A MODEL FOR NURSE
EMPOWERMENT
An article by Betty Katz Sperlich, Mary Conant, and Frederick Hodges,
published in "REVOLUTION:  The Journal of Nurse Empowerment."
Part 4 of a 4-part series
Contributed by typist dyks96a@prodigy.com (George Hill)

Mediation was an exhausting process that threatened to break down on several
occasions.  Ultimately, however, St. Vincent's Hospital had the historical
distinction of becoming the first hospital in the world to officially
 recognize R. N. Conscientious Objectors to infant circumcision.

Nurses play a major role in patient care and are responsible, with
physicians, for the ethical treatment of patients.  While many physicians
oppose forced infant circumcision, nurses have taken the lead in initiating
the reform of medical practice and taking a firm stand in support of the
internationally recognized principles of medical ethics, patient advocacy,
and human rights.

We call upon all nurses to join us in our reformation of medical practice.
 Collective actions empower nurses to initiate change and empower the public
to uphold the basic human rights of body-ownership and self determination.

PROTECTING BOYS IN HOSPITALS
X-From: DYKS96A@prodigy.com (GEORGE HILL)

I am planning to draft some advices to parents who have decided against
circumcision and who wish to protect their newborn son against an inadvertant
or wrongful circumcision in hospital.  I would be grateful for any
suggestions of methods, devices, procedures, precautions, or whatever of
protecting an infant boy in a typical North American hospital.
