NEONATAL CIRCUMCISION DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINST CANCER

Editor, - Although Morten Frisch and colleagues have made a valuable
contribution to the study of penile cancer, they mistakenly repeat the myth
that neonatal circumcision renders the subject immune to penile cancer.[1]
 The reference given for this statement is not an epidemiological study but
an opinion article by the American circumcisionist Abraham L. Wolbarst in
1932.[2]  Wolbarst invented this myth and was directly responsible for its
proliferation; he based it on unverifiable anecdotes, ethnocentric
stereotypes, a faulty understanding of human anatomy and physiology, a
misunderstanding of the distinction between association and cause, and a
unbridled missionary zeal.  It was not based on valid scientific and
epidemiological research.

All subsequent repetions of this myth are traceable to Wolbarst's article,
though Wolbarst himself advocated universal neonatal circumcision principally
as a preventive for epilepsy, paralysis, and masturbation.  Circumcisionists
such as Wolbarst do not seem to have promoted this myth because they have a
genuine interest in reducing penile cancer; they used it instead as a scare
tactic to increase the rate of neonatal circumcision.  It is surprising that
sober scientists such as Frisk and colleagues could have relied on such a
reference in their research.

Edidemiological studies disproved Wolbarst's myth long ago.  In North America
the rate of penile cancer has been estimated to be 1 in 100,000[3] --
somewhat higher than the rate of 0.82 per 100,000 found by Frisch and
colleagues.  Maden et al reported penile cancer among a fifth of elderly
patients form rural areas who had been circumcised neonatally and had been
born at a time when the rate of neonatal circumcision was about 20% in rural
populations.[4]  Their study also shows that the rate of penile cancer among
men circumcised neonatally has risen in the United States relative to the
rise in the rate of neonatal circumcision.

Science must look beyond normal human anatomy to discover the true risk
factors for penile cancer.  Current investigations into risks posed by
infection with human papillomavirus (circumcised males have been shown to
have an increased rate of such infection) and use of tobacco have been
instructive.[5]  Frisch and his colleagues have otherwise injected a welcome
note of scientific rationalism into the debate over circumcision, which,
despite the active participation of medical staff, is in essence an issue not
of medical science but of human rights.

"THE FORESKIN IS NECESSARY"

Violation of Human Rights:
Before introducing the policy of routine infant circumcision after World War
II, circumcisers did not examine the human rights violation involved in the
policy of forcing or even allowing unconsenting individuals to undergo
surgery to amputate healthy penile tissue.  More than just physical harm,
circumcision causes political harm.  Even if circumcision were physically
harmless -- which it is not - it would still constitute a human rights
violation.  Furthermore, circumcisers have never shown that the stated public
health goals could not have ben achieved by a less coercive policy than by
foreskin amputation.  The failure of the policy of mass circumcision to
achieve the public health goals of reducing the rates of STDs, cancer, and
genital infections is made more tragic in light of the harm, sexual
dysfunction, morbidity, and risk of fatality unjustly inflicted on the past
few generations of American males.

Every male has the right to keep his birthright of an intact penis.  Children
have a right to expect parents or guardians to protect this right while they
are still unable to protect it themselves.  Parents and physicians have no
right to remove health body parts from non-consenting individuals.  In 1995,
the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics agreed.  According
to their recent statement,(23) only a competent patient can give patient
consent or informed consent.  An infant is developmentally incompetent to
consent to non-therapeutic surgery.  The concept of informed parental
permission does not apply to circumcision since the concept of informed
parental permission allows only for medical intervention in cases of clear
and immediate medical necessity, i. e., diseases, trauma or deformity; the
natural human penis satisfies none of these conditions.

Furthermore, since it is the infant and not the parent who must live with the
consequences of this 'treatment' the individuals legal right to refuse
treatment as well as the right to seek alternative treatment has been
violated.  Likewise the basic human right to autonomy, self-determination,
and the right to an intact body as outlined in Article 5.1 of the American
Convention on Human Rights(1969) and article 1.1 of the International
Convention of Human, Civil, and Political Rights(1966) are violated by the
performance of non-therapeutic circumcision.
