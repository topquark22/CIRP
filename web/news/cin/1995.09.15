OH, PRAY...NOT OPRAH!
On Thursday, 14 September 1995, Oprah Winfrey devoted the first two thirds of
her show to female genital mutilation (FGM).  For those unaware of the
practice, the show was shocking waker-upper, and served its purpose well.
 For those of us who are aware of both male and female genital mutilation, it
was an annoying reminder of just how ignorant, sexist, and ethnocentric
America is when it comes to genital mutilation.

The guests on the show were our friends Soraya Mire and Mimi Ramsey, both
survivors of FGM, and Dr. Nahid Toubia, also an activist.  Dr. Toubia is
aware of the male genital mutilation (MGM) issue, as she has been talked to
by our friend Dr. Anastasios Zavales of Ecumenics International, but she
hasn't taken a firm stand on the issue.  Both Soraya and Mimi have taken a
very firm stand against MGM ("mutilation is mutilation, cut is cut...") but
the viewer would have no way of knowing it by watching this show.

This morning, 15 Sept., I talked with Soraya.  She told me that she tried to
call attention to MGM as an equal rights issue and that she also addressed
non-traditional FGM right here in America (clitorectomies to curb
masturbation, surgical alterations to "correct" hermaphroditic anatomy,
hysterectomies and episiotomies), but her wisdom on the subjects was edited
out.

As for Oprah, she showed a wanton disregard for the rights of males.  In her
opening statement, she passionately proclaimed "What we think of as male
circumcision is nothing like [FGM].  This is really mutilation of the female
sex organs if you can imagine that.  And it's often done with no anesthesia,
and has devastating, long term health consequences."  This set the pace for
the entire show, which was loaded with facts and statements that could easily
be associated with MGM -- once sexism, ethnocentricity and ignorance are
stripped away.

NOCIRC and others have repeatedly sent Oprah information over the years.  

$10,000 REWARD
FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO THE RECOVERY OF THE PROVIDENCE HOSPITAL MEDICAL
RECORDS OF JACOB SWEET...OR INFORMATION LEADING TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE
PERSON OR PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOSS OR DESTRUCTION OF JACOB'S RECORDS
Thanks to typist DYKS96A@prodigy.com (MR GEORGE HILL)

Jacob Sweet was born at PROVIDENCE HOSPITAL in Anchorage on 16 January 1986.
 He was a healthy and normal baby boy.  On 17 January 1986 Jacob was
circumcised by JAMES NESBITT, M. D. of the CHILDREN'S CLINIC.  On Saturday,
25 January, Jacob's parents brought Jacob back to the emergency room at
PROVIDENCE because he was vomiting and was fussy and the circumcision site
was red and swollen.  They were met by Daniel Tulip, M. D. also of THE
CHILDREN'S CLINIC.  DR. TULIP admitted Jacob to the hospital.  Late in the
evening of 26 January, Jacob suffered a prolonged seizure or "crash" and was
transferred to the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit at 2:15 a. m. on
Monday 27 January.

Today, Jacob is nine years old and severely brain damaged.  He cannot walk,
talk or care for himself in any respect.

Note:  Significant and important portions of Jacob's records for the 26-hour
period from the time he was admitted until the crash are missing.

The attorneys for the Sweets listed below, believe that there are persons
with knowledge of how the records may have become "lost" and would like to
speak to anyone with knowledge of how records may have become "lost" and
would like to speak with anyone with any knowledge regarding Jacob and his
"lost" records.  We are particularly interested in speaking with former
employees and/or acquaintances of Providence Hospital and the Children's
Clinic and of Drs. Tulip and Nesbitt.

We understand that you may feel pressured not to come forward.  All we ask is
your complete honesty and your assistance in a manner of extreme importance,
not only for Jacob but also for the medical care of future patients in our
community.  Payment of all or a portion of the reward is in the good faith
discretion of Jacob's attorneys who assure you that you will be treated
fairly.

TWO GO TO LEAVENWORTH FOR TEN YEARS -- REFUSE TO SUBMIT TO OPERATION
The State, Columbia, South  Carolina, September 20, 1918 
Thanks to typist George Hill, dyks96a@prodigy.com.

"The general courtmartial at Camp Jackson yesterday made public the findings
in the trial of two soldiers refusing to submit to slight operations which
would have made them fit for military duty.

"Each got a sentence of ten years in the United States disciplinary barracks,
Leavenworth, Kan.  In addition to this each man is to forfeit all pay and
allowances due or to become due to him and at the expiration of his term of
servitude is to be dishonorably discharged from the army service.

"The soldiers were Private Charles Gregor, Thirty-eighth Company, One Hundred
and Fifty-sixth Depot Brigade and Private William A. Hammond, Thirty-third
Company, One Hundred and Fifty-sixth Depot Brigade.

"The sentences of both men were duly approved and will be executed."

Editor's note:  We of CIN suspect that the "slight" operation in question was
circumcision.  It appears that this was a horrific violation of human rights
and that the conviction should be overturned and the discharges be changed to
honorable.  We request that anyone with any knowledge of this case come
forward.
