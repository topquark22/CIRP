"THE FORESKIN IS NECESSARY"
An article by Paul M. Fleiss. MD, MPH, and Frederick Hodges
Townsend Letter for Doctors and Patients, April 1996.
Contributed by typist DYKS96A@prodigy.com ( GEORGE HILL)
Second of a multi-part series.

Functions of the Foreskin
Protection:
Analogous to the eyelid, the foreskin protects and preserves the sensitivity
of the glans by maintaining optimal levels of moisture, warmth, pH balance,
and cleanliness.  The glans itself contains no sebaceous glands and relies on
the sebaceous glands in the foreskin for production and distribution of sebum
to maintain proper epithelial lubrication.

Viral and Bacteriological Defenses:
Glands in the soft mucosa produce antiviral and antibacterial secretions such
as lysozyme.  The urinary meatus is an entry point into the body.  From
infancy to adulthood, the spincter at the end of the orifice insures optimum
protection of the glans and urinary meatus from contaminants of all kinds.

Preputial Erogenous Sensitivity:
The foreskin possesses a richer variety and a greater number of specialized
nerve receptors than any other part of the penis.(1) The glans is stimulated
by the mechanical rolling pressure of the foreskin and not by friction.  The
frenulum, the frenar band and the preputial orifice contain dense
concentrations of specialized erotogenic nerve receptors, such as Meissner
corpuscles, Merkel Discs, and Genital End-bulbs.(2)  These nerve rich
structures constitute the primary orgasmic triggers.  They are stimulated by
stretching the foreskin and by the movement of the glans within the foreskin.

Coital Mechanics:
The natural sexual functions and mechanics of the penis depend entirely upon
the foreskin.  The function of the foreskin in coitus is to permit
intercourse to take place under optimal conditions without friction between
the mucosal surfaces of the two participants.  The penile shaft slides within
its own skin which is held in place by the vaginal muscles.  Nature has
designed it so that the female partner is stimulated by pressure and not
friction.  The natural penis is self lubricating.  Vaginal secretions serve
only to ease the initial insertion of the penis.  Preputial secretions enable
the foreskin to evert and revert smoothly over the glans.

"I'LL VOUCH FOR THAT"
Contributed by cogadh@cris.com (PFB)
In my personal experience as a cut guy, I found that being able to go longer
was not a plus, my wife got tired of the pounding and it seemed so
impersonal.  When I got close I had to finish because if I stalled I seemed
to become desensitized. 

Now that I am restoring [reconstructing a foreskin by means of stretching
remaining penile skin], I find that I am able to take my time, control my
movements and both my wife and I enjoy the process much more than before.  I
am also less exhausted when we finish so that we can enjoy the afterglow much
more.  Being more sensitive means that I and my wife can enjoy the act more
since it is a more erotic sensual experience rather than a physical marathon.


ALL MUTILATION IS IMMORAL
Contributed by sami.aldeeb@isdc-dfjp.unil.ch (Sami Aldeeb)

You cannot be against female circumcision and in favor of male circumcision
at the same time unless you are willing to convince us that:

- your culture is better than others' cultures
- your religion is better than others' religions
- your holy book is better than others's holy books
- girls have to be protected but not boys.

There is one principle that you have to accept or to totally reject: the
right for physical integrity.  If you accept this principle, you have to
apply it for any person whatever be his religion, race, colour, sex or
culture.

As I accept the aforesaid principle, I consider both male circumcision and
female circumcisions as crimes that should be punished when practiced against
a non-consenting person without an effective and serious medical reason.

For this reason, I consider as immoral the western (and any other)
legislations which condemn female circumcision and accept male circumcision.

Remember here that this is the crime the most committed on the earth, daily,
without punishment, with the benediction of Jehovah, Allah, legislators and
charlatan physicians all over the world, in "civilised" countries as well as
in jungles.

I would like to know how many readers of this group accept the idea I present
here.  Could you please send me a direct e-mail to express your agreement or
disagreement?

Thank you in advance.
