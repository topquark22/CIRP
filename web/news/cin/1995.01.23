VAST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ADULT AND INFANT CIRCUMCISION
A Commentary from NOHARMM, the National Organization to Halt the Abuse and
Routine Mutilation of Males

For men circumcised as adults who might not understand why those circumcised
as infants are so vehemently opposed to this routine newborn surgery, it
helps to understand that infant circumcision is a vastly different procedure
from adult surgery.  

The infant foreskin is naturally non-retractable (to protect the sensitive
glans, or head, from urine, feces and abrasion).  The natural separation of
the foreskin and glans has not yet happened and infant circumcision, almost
always done without anesthesia, tears the adherent foreskin from the glans
and exposes the raw mucosal tissue of the glans.  It is an excruciatingly
painful procedure (during and after) that the infant cannot understand or
escape from.  While the average male circumcised in infancy may not
consciously remember the experience, the somatic trauma alters brain
chemistry, as well as interferes with normal penile development.  Those
circumcised as an adult suffer less trauma because the man has consented to
the surgery, the foreskin has already separated from the glans, anesthesia
and post-operative pain management are used, and any pain may be rationalized
as worth the price paid to accommodate his motivations.  Surgical mishap is
far more common in infancy than adulthood.
 
Also, when the foreskin is removed from an infant or an adult, the glans
keratinizes (forms extra layers of skin) to protect itself.  This is a
lifelong process resulting in progressive sensitivity loss.  In an infant,
this process begins immediately and those circumcised as infants are subject
to many more years of keratinization than those circumcised as adults.
Progressive sensitivity loss for the man circumcised in infancy becomes more
noticeable in his thirties and forties.  The average male circumcised as an
infant however, cannot imagine the extent of his deprivation.  [This is true
for females in some African cultures who have had their foreskin (clitoral
hood) removed in the "mild" form of mutilation known as Sunna.]  Combine this
ignorance with fear, embarrassment and homophobia and it's easy to see why
few men circumcised in infancy speak out.

A COMMENT FROM AUSTRALIA
The situation seems to be quite different as far as my experiences go. I have
three children (2 girls, 1 boy) and had never even considered having my son
circumcised. Having all three children in different hospitals (Mercy Hosp.
Melbourne; Woden Valley Hosp. Canberra and Queen Adelaide Hosp. Hobart), I
found that circumcision was strongly discouraged. I remember one mother in my
room who had the senior midwife and the surgical registrar both trying to
talk her OUT of having her son circumcised. This was during the mid 1980's.
BTW, I have 4 brothers, born in the 1960's and all of them were circumcised
as a matter of routine! interesting subject for a newsgroup! --An Australian
Reader

WHY INTACT IS CLEANER
This brings up some interesting thoughts...  In the dark ages, circumcision
was a necessity in the desert kingdoms like Judea. For lack of water, perhaps
removal of the foreskin kept the glans clean and not let smegma accumulate.
Today--especially in America--we have running water and have learnt to wash
and bathe regularly. Circumcision is a paradigm at best!  --An American
Reader

CIN:  Actually, circumcision was never necessary.  The following information
is from a nationally famous, distinguished pediatrician, Dr. Leonard J.
Marino of Plainview, LI, NY, and excerpted from a bulletin distributed by
Northport Circumcision Information Research Center of New York:

"An intact man who is in a war trench, desert, or jungle, without water to
bathe, merely has to pinch shut the orifice of his prepuce when he urinates,
trap a small balloon of urine inside, and swish it around for ablutions.
Urine is sterile, suitable to prevent irritation and for cleanliness.  

"This simple technique shows that in hardship situations, circumcision is
doubly unwise; the prepuce is a versatile portable gadget for intimate
hygiene, as well as protection.  

"It is vital that this be publicized, as many circumcisions are done because
doctors, parents and most men do not realize the importance and usefulness of
the prepuce.  The above is only one example of its hygienic functions."

Indeed, it is easier for an intact male to keep himself clean than a female
to keep herself clean (they produce more smegma than men do!)....yet
Westerners do not advocate female "circumcision" for cleanliness.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH CIRCUMCISING GIRLS?
"I really don't see anything wrong with circumcision...if it is done at birth
or in a religious ceremony soon afterwards, the girl will in no way remember
the pain...millions upon millions of girls have been circumcised, and lived
happy, happy lives. True, if a woman wishes to become circumcised, it will be
quite painful and will require days in the hospital.

"I don't know...I just think a circumcised vagina looks better than an
uncircumcised one.  Go figure." --M.T. of Utah

CIN:  Actually the original letter referred to male circumcision.  The gender
has been switched to put the issue in perspective.  The revised letter
actually resembles what a man from certain cultures might actually say.  

"A PIECE OF SKIN THE SIZE OF A QUARTER"
Photographs of the intact adult male foreskin by John A. Erickson can now be
ordered, for adults only.  These photographs were exhibited at the Third
International Symposium on Circumcision at the University of Maryland, 22-25
May 1994.  Order includes the Three Zones of Penile Skin, five photographs
showing the foreskin at various stages of retraction, with lines drawn where
the foreskin begins on the shaft and at the mucocutaneous junction to show
the amount of total penile skin--more than half--that is foreskin.  Brief
Text.  These are, according to NOCIRC Founder and Director Marilyn Milos, RN,
"Photographs that show exactly what we are trying to protect."  The 33 4" x
6" color closeup photos are $30 postpaid first class (air) anywhere.
Original exhibit size (8" x 12") are available by special order.  John A.
Erickson, 1664 Beach Blvd., #216, Dept. GA, Biloxi, MS 39531-5351.
