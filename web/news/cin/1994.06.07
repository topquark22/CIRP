The Third International Symposium on Circumcision, 22-25 May
It was like a family reunion.  As Marilyn Milos said in her
introductory speech, it was an occasion for us to reinforce each
other,and remind ourselves that we are ones who are normal.
Experts from seven countries convened.  Topics included care of the
intact penis, female genital mutilation, religious concerns,
foreskin restoration, and much more.  The keynote speaker was
actor/comedian Dick Gregory.
Activists left with a new or reinforced understanding of just
how complicated this issue is and how much work is needed.  To give an
idea of how taboo circumcision is, the hosts at the conference
center refused to advertise the word "circumcision."  Instead, we
were listed as "Nocirc Symposium for Human Rights."
But an ABC affiliate in Baltimore showed up to film for a report
to be aired in the fall.  A reporter from the Philadelphia Inquirer,
the third largest newspaper in the U.S., spent a day with us.
His article, complete with a listing of resources, appeared in
the Sunday, 5 June issue.
Adding dimensions to the issue of genital/sexual mutilation were
a woman who was excised at the age of three because her mother
caught her masturbating, a woman who was severely mutilated due to
a botched surgery which she did not consent to and subsequent
surgeries which did more damage, and a doctor who permanently
lost sensation to her clitoris after a novocaine shot during
childbirth, not to mention episiotomy and C-section--all of
these American women.
Several awards were given at the banquet at the end of the symposium.
The awardees included Dr. Thomas Ritter, author of "Say No to
Circumcision;" Dr. Jim Bigelow, author of "The Joy of Uncircumcising;"
Barry Ellsworth, who made several documentaries on circ including
"Fire Eyes" and "Nurses of St. Vincent: Saying No To Circumcision;"
NOHARMM founder Tim Hammond who conducted an historic study on the
long-term effects of circ on men; and the Nurses of Santa Fe,
conscientious objectors of circumcision.
The banquet speaker, professor Thomas Szasz, advised the attendees
that only three things bring about social change: bullets, money,
and guilt. He reminded us that circ is not a rational issue,
but an emotional one, and suggested we not rule out using emotion
(guilt, shame) in changing physicians' and parents' attitudes.
 
Rally and March in Washington, D.C.
On 26 May, activists gathered in Washington, D.C. to protest.
Chanting and bearing signs, we marched to the building of the
PhysiciansUs Committee for Responsible Medicine, who has not yet
taken a stand against routine infant circ--even though it has
taken a stand against other unethical and unnecessary procedures.
There, we held a rally that attracted some media. Men ceremoniously
burned copies of their birth certificates to protest the fact that
they were treated as pieces of property when born.  Women, and men
who did not have birth certificates, burned instead copies of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights to protest the fact that
human rights are ignored when it comes to genital mutilation.
Several delegates were invited by the PCRM president to meet with
him and share their concerns. They emerged from the meeting hopeful
of continued dialog with PCRM.
 
Mother wins injury award for son's circumcision
The 22 May Independent of London reports, in part, RA London woman
whose baby son was circ'd on the instructions of his father but
against her wishes has won compensation from the
CriminalInjuriesCompensation Board.The board agreed to
make the payment for her son although no prosecution
took place. Now the mother plans to
sue the father for assault on behalf of her son, as soon as her
solicitors can track him down. Theodore Ilori, now 5, was 18 months
old at the time of the operation. His father, Olubunmi Ilori,
wanted circ preformed because it is traditional in his native
Nigeria.

 Our English friend Dr. John Warren scored a terrific
letter in response on 29 May.
 
New York NOHARMM Action Report: Hospital visits
On 3 June, Barry Ellsworth and Richard DeSeabra visited the Labor
and Delivery floor at St. Vincent Hospital in New York City. RWe
talked with several nurses, expressing our concern about routine
infant circ. We left them [various materials]. We also spoke with
the nurse supervisor, who was open to our position. In all we spent
about an hour and a half in the hospital speaking with different
staff members and distributing literature."Similar hospital visits
have been made in the last two weeks in D.C., and Rochester, NY by
Tim Hammond, Daniel Calendo, Betty Sperlich, and Mary Conant.

Good News
%Congratulations to our friend M. F. of New York, who scored a
letter to the editor in the March/April issue of OURS magazine in
support of our friends Darillyn's and Dr. Steven Starr's article
in July/August 1993 issue. See NOCIRC of Japan Newsletter
Vo.. 2:29 (27 August 1993). Her letter reads in part:
"No one in my immediate family is circ'd and we have experienced
a better life without circumcision. My Jewish Hungarian doctor
helped me avoid circumcision by reinforcing my opposition and
knowing proper care of the infant."

Cliff Pointer of Arkansas, and a Nurse named Dorothyanne Last of ON,
