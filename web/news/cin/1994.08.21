DAMON THE BARBARIAN
On a recent David Letterman show, actor Damon Wayans ("In Living Color")
bragged (and joked) about having both his sons circ'd at the ages of about
seven and nine for various reasons (none of them good). The audience seemed
to think it hilarious, especially the part where the boys, two years later,
are still angry with him.  "They give me looks like 'You hurt me.'"  That's
why he put them in his new movie "Blankman," to make it up to them (how
sweet!)  Only in America.  Thanks to Susan Peer of Pennsylvania.

CECIL ADAMS SHOWING IMPROVEMENT
Cecil Adams has addressed circumcision yet again in his column "The Straight
Dope."  The good news is he is coming around to his senses, thanks to many
letters from activists, though he still has a way to go.  He still finds it
hard to believe that circumcision diminishes sexual pleasure.  Unfortunately,
I don't have a copy of the column in front of me, but keep an eye out for it.

CIRCUMCISION IS WEIRD
Chuck Shepherd, "News of the Weird," writes in VIEWS FROM THE LEDGE, "I've
received five dispatches from various, uh, anti-circumcision activists.  No
two were alike, yet each package was among the most elaborate press kits I
have ever seen, featuring newspaper reprints, summaries of scientific studies
condemning the practice, detailed drawings of the operation itself, quotes
from 'victims.'  These people care.  Gah bless."  Shepherd and his "News of
the Weird" column has been featured twice in the Guardian Angell for failing
to list circumcision among the MGM suffered by men.  He may think we
anti-circumcisionists are weird, but most informed people in the world think
that America's obsession with circumcision is what is weird.

MOST COMM0N SURGERY
Dr. Sidney Wolfe and Public Citizen Health Research Group have been loudly
proclaiming Cesarean section to remain "America's most frequently performed,
and most often unnecessary, surgical procedure."  Apparently they have never
heard of episiotomy or circumcision.  

CIRCUMCISION A CAUSE OF IMPOTENCE
Our friend Marilyn Milos, founder and director of NOCIRC, scored a terrific
letter to editor in California's 18 August Point Reyes Light newspaper
entitled "Circumcision inhibits orgasms" in response to Eleanor Hamilton's 28
July column, "Impotence revisited."  Excerpts:  "Once I understood loss of
sensitivity and increased effort to achieve orgasm to be a result of
circumcision, I began calling groups that deal with impotence to ask what
they know.  Not only did they not know anything about  this complaint of
circumcised men, they also refused to consider circumcision to be a cause of
the complaint.  Circumcision for 'medical' reasons is a
quarter-billion-dollar-a-year industry.  Eighty-five percent of the world's
males are intact; the vast mafority are problem free.  Is it not time to
consider how this unnecessary and debilitating surgery is affecting our
males?"  

The Point Reyes Light is an award-winning newspaper with a national
readership.  

A NEW ALLY
The Men's Action Council is an new organization to promote men's rights,
including protection from MGM (male genital mutilation).  Its quarterly
newsletter, ManPower, is on its second issue, which included an article on
MGM.  Unfortunately, it is fairly unusual in America for even men's rights
organizations to recognize MGM (other than the Bobbit type) as a men's rights
issue.  For more information, send a SASE to Men's Action Council, Box 27365,
Golden Valley, MN 55427. 

MIDWEST ACTIVIST AWARDED
Harry Meislahn, midwest distributor of the Guardian Angell, held a contest
among his GA recipients. He writes "Paul Froelich won the contest for the
most actions undertaken between 1 January and 31 May.  He mailed nine letters
and saw two published, one in the Chicago Tribune and one in the Daily
Herald.  He also got me to write to the Herald, and this was published as
well.  I am mailing him a free copy of Anne Briggs's Circumcision:  What
Every Parent Should Know."  Outstanding!

By the way, the Guardian Angell is a newsletter published about every three
weeks and distributed by network.  Whereas the CIN CompuBulletin is designed
to inform the general public, the GA is for people who are already
enlightened about circumcision and other genital mutilation and would like to
participate in abolishing it.  Contact CIN for more information.  There is no
subscription fee, although recients are expected to take action and/or donate
financial or mailing stamps.

OTHER LETTERS
In Vol. 3:4 (30 March) of the Guardian Angell, it was reported that
March/April Natural Health magazine featured an article by Adriane Fugh-Berman
, M.D., entitled "The New dangers of Medical Prevention."  Congratulations to
our friends Duane Jorde and Cliff Pointer, whose letters appeared in the
July/August issue, pointing out the glaring omission of circumcision from the
doctor's list of unnecessary surgeries.  There are more letters by activists
throughout the world, than we can count.

VERMONT NOCIRC NEWSLETTER LAUNCHED
Editor Gary Davis, writes "This is the first [issue, August 1994].  Let us
know you care since the time and effort to publish the letter need be
balanced with the perception that it's being read.  Write us at NOCIRC of VT,
5 Cherry Tree Ct., Saint Albans, VT 05478.
     
NYC ACTIVISTS MAKING PROGRESS
The August NOHARMM-NYC meeting was held and a pot-luck dinner provided. New
members were introduced. Each member re-introduced himself and discussed his
individual NOHARMM accomplishments. Several new parents had been educated on
the fallacy of circumcision and 
their male infants were allowed to remain natural, whole and healthy.
 Several possible actions and tentative plans for a follow-up actions were
were discussed. The media interest in NORM (foreskin restoration) has
exploded in the NYC area...there have been several interviews, German
television has taped a NORM meeting, and a national network is planning to
feature information on NORM in a national broadcast this fall...Thanks to
Rich DeSeabra.  This fall Rich will be appearing nationally on the John Stewart
Show and will be discussing foreskin restoration.  For information on
NOHARMM-NYC, write:  NOHARMM, PO Box 107, Cooper Station, New York, NY 10003.
