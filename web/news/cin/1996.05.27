The purpose of this weekly 1000-word bulletin is to educate the public about
and to protect children and other non-consenting persons from genital
mutilation.  Readers are encouraged to copy and redistribute it, and to
contribute written material.  --Rich Angell, Editor.

MALE GENITAL MUTILATION TRIVIALIZED
To give an idea of how violence (including genital mutilation) of men is
trivialized, I present a true story of an encounter I had.  

Several years ago, when I was teaching English in Japan, The Japan Times
printed an article about a women in Australia who found a strange object on
the beach.  It turned out to be a man's severed penis.  This was not long
after another man's body, not related to this penis, was found cut into many
pieces.  My Canadian gender-feminist co-worker discovered the article.  Upon
reading it, she exclaimed, "Oh my gosh!  Did you read about the woman in
Australia who was walking on the beach and found a..."

"Yes, I sure did," I said, not wanting to hear the rest.

"Poor WOMAN!"  she said.

The following resources and reading materials are very helpful.

Resources:
Several national and international educational and activist professional
organizations exist which serve the medical community by sponsoring
professional symposia, providing educational materials, and advocating a
reform of medical practice.  These professional organizations offer support
and advice for health care professionals who seek to end the
socially-sanctioned genital mutilation of minors.  They also act as human
rights advocates for infants and children by informing and educating the
public that the forced amputation of genitals of an unconsenting infant or
child, whether in the name of medicine, religion or social custom, is a human
rights violation.  Physicians are urged to contact and join:

for professionals.

Much of the harm of circumcision does not become apparent until adulthood.
 Dr. Bigelow's book is a fascinating exploration of the history, myths, and
psychology of the circumcision problem in the U. S.  It is also the best book
on non-surgical restoration, a therapeutic procedure more and more adult
males are turning to, often on doctor's recommendations, to solve some of the
physical and sexual harm caused by infant circumcision.

STUPID QUOTE OF THE WEEK
Thanks to donmorgan@nas.com (Don Morgan).
"Circumcision never did ME any harm."
Hymie Goldberg, inventor of KY Jelly.  This was taken on 17 May 1996 from
CIRquote, a brand new service which aims to inform, edify, and campaign for
the advantages of this "wholesome and trouble-free procedure."  This may
qualify as stupid quote of the year, for KY Jelly and other artificial
lubricants are rendered necessary primarily because of circumcision.
