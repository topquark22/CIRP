AAP PROTEST
A compiled report from Al Fields and Richard DeSeabra.

The demonstration was a success.  At noon Saturday, 8 April, men and women
from NOHARMM-NYC, NOHARMM-Philadelphia, NOHARMM-Maryland and NOHARMM-New
Hampshire gathered at the annual American Academy of Pediatrics convention
site to demonstrate their concern for the academy's lack of ethics
regarding routine infant circumcision and related human rights issues.  As
we arrived to set up for the demonstration, we soon learned that Larry
Gilligan, NOHARMM-Maryland, was already there, inside the convention site
handing out free copies of Dr. Ritter's "Say No to Circumcision," and
other related literature. 

As actual screams from an infant circumcision were heard, mock
circumcisions were performed in front of the convention site as activists
passed out literature to attendees and passers-by.  A street theatre was
staged in which dolls were handed over to a nurse while parents signed a
consent form.  The dolls were repeatedly strapped to a Circumstraint and a
Gomco circumcision was emulated by a doctor wearing a mask.  Most
physicians who stopped to talk, both male and female, were supportive and
empathic with our position. 

Two female physicians stopped to express their subdued anger at our
demonstration, and discussed several issues.  When confronted with the
human rights issues and later psychological consequences, they laughed and
walked away. 

For many of those passing by, it was an 'awakening' as they paused to read
the literature.  Others asked about restoration. 

Several print media were present, and the Philadelphia ABC and NBC
affiliates shot footage.  Footage from the ABC crew was aired on the
evening news. 

A special thanks to activists who traveled in from other states, and to
Barry Ellsworth and Tom Morris, who put this all together. 

A NEW DEVICE
Reported by Barry Ellsworth
One of the first displays one sees when walking into the AAP convention is
a large picture of the new "Circ-sheet" made by K.BowMed in North Carolina
selling for $100.  At their exhibit booth they are pleased to show you a
picture of Olympic's Circumstraint and say how hard and uncomfortable it
is for the baby.  One demonstrator told me that this device is soft, they
lay on a pad soft like a pillow and it is so comfortable they hardly cry
when strapped to the new Circ-sheet.  I was kind, listened and asked for
their free video which they claim has circumcisions going "smoother" on
the circ-sheet than on the Circumstraint. 

Their pamphlet reads:  "K Bow Circ sheet:  The K Bow Circ sheet provides
simple means of gently, but firmly restraining babies for
procedures--particularly circumcisions. 

"Features:  Launderable soft urethane backed sheet / Velcro strips with
soft loops hold infant in flexed position / Fits on soft foam pad /
Adaptable for infant size / Meets OSHA requirements

"Advantages:  Easy set up / Easy clean-up / Head elevated to reduce
spitting / Comfortable." 

[We should] let them know that whether the baby is on soft foam or hard
plastic, IT IS STILL GENITAL MUTILATION. 

AN INTERVIEW WITH THE NURSES OF ST. VINCENT
The New Times, February, 1995, Seattle, Washington, by Cat Saunders
[Fourth of a five-part series.  The first part was Saunders' own view of
circumcision as a human rights issue.  The second & third parts were the
beginning of the interview.]

A group of nurses from St. Vincent' s Hospital in Santa Fe, New
Mexico...have organized to stop circumcision.  In this interview, I spoke
with four of the nurses who were in Seattle recently.  As you read their
stories, open your heart.  Let your feelings come, for only if we all feel
the horror of circumcision can we stop it.  Together we can stop it now... 

Carole, a personal question for you.  You said on the video that one of
your sons is circumcised--the other is not--and that if you could take
back one thing in your life, you would take back your younger son's
circumcision.  I'm wondering, how would you coach parents who are
beginning to come out of their denial and are realizing the horror of what
they've done? 

Carole:  I feel like I'm still working on me.  I'm dealing with the whole
feeling of being an accomplice to all this for so many years, and for
doing what I did to my son.  Before I go out and try I to tell someone
else how to heal, I have to do it for myself first. 

Betty:  Yes.  We have so much to heal about being accomplices ourselves. 
In "Banished Knowledge," Alice Miller writes about the importance of the
witness coming forth, which is what I feel we are doing.  We are saying
what is happening, because the male myth is, "Well, I was circumcised and
I am fine, and my son was circumcised and he's fine."  But we're saying,
"Maybe you were circumcised.  But it wasn't fine, because we were there,
and we saw what happened.  It's the same thing with your baby:  We were
there, and we saw it.  It was not fine." 

Cat:  I wouldn't say this directly to such a man unless he was way out of
denial, but I'll tell you that I doubt he's really "fine." 

Betty:  Yes.  That is the next step, for the grown men to come out.  It's
happening now.  There is a powerful coalition forming.  We women are
coming out as mothers and as witnesses to this brutal sexual assault. 
Women who have been circumcised in Africa are coming out, too.  We're all
saying this isn't okay.  But it's a weird situation.  We identify
ourselves as feminists.  And we haven't been well received by other
feminists. 

Carole:  They're saying, "Circumcision is a men's issue.  Why are you
helping them?  What are we going to get out of it?" 

Cat:  Well, a whole lot less rapes, for one thing!  Less aggression, less
violence.  Nicer relationships.  More trust. 

Carole:  How about just a nicer place to be?
