AD HOC WORKING GROUP OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS ON VIOLATIONS OF GENITAL
MUTILATION
A Human Rights Research Project of Ecumenics International
NEWS RELEASE        FOR IMMEDIATE DISTRIBUTION
(Thanks to typist George Hill)
1 July 1995, SOUTHFIELDS, NEW YORK USA--As of 27 June 1995 the Ad Hoc
Working Group of International Experts on Violations of Genital Mutilation
(subnamed "Int'l VGM") officially began its four year tenure in response
to the United Nations' "Convention on The Rights of the Child" (Article
24.3): "States Parties shall take all effective and appropriate measures
with a view to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health
of children." and to Chapter 12, B 12.13 of the "Programme of Action" of
the International Conference on Population and Development (IPCD) calling
for international research projects concentrating on "genital mutilation,
where practiced." 

The Int'l VGM's prime objective is to generate local, national, regional,
and global resource-sharing and establish worldwide databases on human
rights infractions of genital mutilation, erroneously termed male and
female circumcision.  Genital Mutilation is a traditional practice of
physiological torture and psychological trauma destroying reproductive
integrity and sexual health with significant risks of death.  In late
1994, a global call for nominations was issued by Ecumenics International
(a non-profit, humanitarian, non-governmental organization) to assure
equal and equitable distribution of resource sharing and global
representation on violations of genital mutilation which affects no less
than 15 million children each year. 

Globally, genital mutilation affects over 13.3 million males per year;
North America annually tallies 1.25 million male neonate victims (one
every 26 seconds).  Just over two million girls and young women throughout
Africa are mutilated each year (one every 12 seconds).  The boy-child and
men constitute 84% of the global total of genital mutilation.  Unfounded
by medical, social, traditional, or belief justifications, genital
mutilation violates at least 18 UN human rights documents.  With well over
USD $250,000,000 invested in genital mutilation, and the proliferation of
transnational corporations trafficking in amputated child body organs in a
multi-billion dollar business, the international community seeks to review
the literature on genital mutilation. and consider corrective action as
necessary for social development.  The Int'l VGM has appealed to the UN's
Population Fund (UNFPA), host agency of IPCD, and has received its
cooperation for monitoring of the working groups activities and needs as
they pertain to the UN.  The Int'l VGM has members and affiliates in all
regions of the world serving as local contacts and coordinating bodies.

CIRCUMCISION LAWSUITS:  BEHIND THE SCENES
Contributed by Barry Ellsworth, BarryBE@aol.com
Following Up On 22 June's Story of the Death of Demetrius Manker:
Unfortunately, personal injury settlements usually involve a guarantee by
the plaintiff that they will not go public with their story and thus
further discredit the doctor or hospital.  This is why we have only
sketchy information about most of the seriously botched circumcisions that
have ended in law suits.  In this case, I'm not even sure why the lawyer
agreed to the interview in the first place.  He may have thought that I
was a bigger fish than I am, and hoped that the threat of exposure on
night line or some other program would drive the settlement up.  Or he
wanted to "rehearse" his client for the final courtroom testimony.  He was
a rather slick fellow, and not at all interested in condemning
circumcision as a practice.  After the interview, he offered to pay me for
a copy of the tape, which would of course have established it as his
property.  I refused.  I sent him a free dub and a release form, which he
had led me to believe that his client would sign.  I never got either
back, and repeated calls to his office were not returned.  I didn't want
to blow the interview by insisting on a release in advance, because I knew
I was lucky to get it in the first place.  Next time I'll be smarter. 

A VICTIM SPEAKS
Contributed by Christopher P., London, England
As one who suffered the fashionable mutilation of neonate circumcision in
the mid-1940s in Britain, I have always resented the fact that, far from
being a necessary procedure, my circumcision was wholly unnecessary and
has left me, because it was performed by a very junior doctor, with a
penis so tightly cut that a full erection is very uncomfortable, with a
scar that looks as if the operation were done with a pair of pinking
scissors and which wanders up and down the shaft, with a glans which is
pitted from infections contracted (my mother told me) whilst I was in
diapers from which a foreskin would have protected me (so my father, a
doctor, told me) and with a glans so insensitive that I have greater
sensitivity in my finger-tips.  In my mid-30s I finally plucked up courage
(because for many years I feared further butchery to a penis which caused
me so much distress from its appearance and lack of proper function) to
have an broad adhesion between the glans and the shaft, caused solely by
the circumcision and its aftermath, removed:  what struck me was that for
a few weeks the part of the glans so exposed to touch and to the sensation
of my wife's tongue and vagina was intensely more profound than I had
believed possible.  For the first time oral sex from my wife was something
that I could actually feel in a small part of my glans. In due course the abrasion of clothing reduced that part of the glans to the
same grey, insensitive piece of flesh as the rest.

Having glimpsed for myself, no matter in so small a part of the glans and
for such a brief time, how life might have been had I not been mutilated
as a victim of medical fashion, my resentment and my sense of loss and
loathing increased and deepened.  At the age of 50 I still harbour bitter
anger towards my mother for giving into the blandishments of the doctors. 
In recent treatment for alcoholism, this anger and the sense of being
different from the rest of my family, all of whom were not circumcised,
were seen as being major causes of the feelings and lack of self-worth
which lead me to abuse alcohol.  My sex-life with my wife has been, to her
great distress, infrequent for most of our marriage because it was for me
rarely a source of physical pleasure;  I am now, and have been for some 7
years, almost totally impotent.  I yearn to know, with a sense that I
cannot convey in words, how it must feel to have a foreskin and to feel
not only intercourse but even simple actions as urinating with the
foreskin in its normal position covering the glans.  For myself, I would
favour legislation banning all circumcision unless it were medically
imperative to do it or it was requested by an adult on himself.  I am
aware that that would not find favour with the people (Muslims and Jews)
who circumcise as a matter of religious belief.  But it seems to me
profoundly wrong to subject an infant to the pain (it is carried out
without anaesthetic), risks of complications, mutilation, and the ruin of
his sexual enjoyment and even of his sexual life in the name of a religion
which he might grow up to reject.  To those who cry that such a ban
interferes with religious freedom, I would reply that there are religious
practices which a civilised world now rejects, such as burning heretics at
the stake, and there would be nothing to stop a man of his own volition
deciding that he wished to be circumcised for his freely chosen religious
beliefs;  what is repugnant is that an infant is put through this pain,
mutilation and future sexual dysfunction to a greater or lesser extent
without any say in the matter or any choice in the future being left to
him. 

Proponents of neonate circumcision point to the fact that there are
decisions such as choice of school which parents make for their children,
as justifying taking the particular decision to circumcise.  I consider
that to be a false argument, since even a child who has suffered from poor
schooling as a result of a poor parental choice of school can as an adult
remedy that deficit by adult education.  Circumcision is both deeply
harmful and in practical terms irreversible. 

Incidentally, my wife contracted cervical cancer some years ago, despite
my being circumcised;  so she and I do not even have that so-called
"advantage" to console me for my mutilation.
