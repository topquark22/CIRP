INTRODUCTION
This two-page weekly bulletin is a project of the National Organization of
Circumcision Information Resource Centers, headquartered in San Anselmo,
California.  The purpose of this bulletin is to educate the general public
about and to protect children from routine circumcision and other genital
mutilation, focussing on information, resources, voices of victims, news and
other information.  All readers are encouraged to copy and redistribute it
and are also encouraged to send material to the editor which might be used in
a future issue.  On behalf of children, thank you--Rich Angell, Editor.

Ho Hum, another Mutilation
Your newspaper may not have covered it, but yet another hapless boy has lost
his penis due to a botched circumcision, this one in Israel.  No official
word yet on the exact date, but it was reported last week in a French
Canadian newspaper, according to our Canadian contact, John Outspeake.  This
story will be provided in more detail, hopefully by next week.
For those of you not familiar with this issue, complications such as
mutilation (beyond that which was intended) and even death are not unusual,
despite what you may have heard to the contrary.  According to Dr. Paul
Fleiss, complications are grossly underreported.

DECLARATION OF THE 1ST INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CIRCUMCISION
-We recognize the inherent right of all human beings to an intact body.
 Without religious or racial prejudice, we affirm this basic human right.
-We recognize the foreskin, clitoris and labia are normal, functioning body
parts.
-Parents and/or guardians do not have the right to consent to the surgical
removal or modification of their children's normal genitalia.
-Physicians and other health-care providers have a responsibility to refuse
to remove or mutilate normal body parts.
-The only persons who may consent to medically unnecessary procedures upon
themselves are the individuals who have reached the age of consent
(adulthood), and then only after being fully informed about the risks and
benefits of the procedure.
-We categorically state that circumcision has unrecognized victims.
-In view of the serious physical and psychological consequences that we have
witnessed in victims of circumcision, we hereby oppose the performance of a
single additional unnecessary foreskin, clitoral, or labial amputation
procedure.
-We oppose any further studies which involve the performance of the
circumcision procedure upon unconsenting minors.  We support nay further
studies which involve identification of the effects of circumcision.
-Physicians an other health-care providers do have a responsibility to teach
hygiene and the care of normal body parts and explain their normal anatomical
and physiological development and function throughout life.
-We place the medical community on notice that it is being held accountable
for misconstruing the scientific database available on human circumcision in
the world today.
-Physicians who practice routine circumcisions are violating the first maxim
of medical practice, "PRIMUM NON NOCERE, " "First, Do No Harm," and anyone
practicing genital mutilation is violating Article V of the United Nations
Universal Declaration of Human Rights:  "NO ONE SHALL BE SUBJECTED TO TORTURE
OR TO CRUEL, INHUMAN OR DEGRADING TREATMENT...."

A VICTIM SPEAKS
This circumcision horror story comes from our friend Dan Skomp of Keaau,
Hawaii:
"I personally had my perfectly normal, functional, significant and beautiful
foreskin amputated at age 9 years, during a 'routine' tonsilectomy.  I was
not forewarned that my penis would be involved in the surgery.  I did know,
and consent to the tonsilectomy, as it was supposed to limit my severe and
painful earaches.  It did not limit my earaches.  I awoke in the hospital
with a huge bloody dressing to my penis.  I was horrified, humiliated, and
felt anger, sorrow and deep personal loss.  I now feel that I was raped, or
at least sexually abused.  I was unable to wear underwear for the whole
summer.  Any cloth or touch to the tender glans was painfully sensitive.  I
was left with ugly skin tags, skin bridges and emotional scars which remain
with me nearly 30 years later.  To this day I am apprehensive if anyone sees,
touches, or becomes intimate with my penis.  I have had a lifetime of
inability to form a stable sexual relationship..."

The average person might respond by saying that Dan should have been
circumcised at birth to avoid this trauma later in life, but we know that
circumcision at any age is traumatic and the end result is the same:  a male
without a complete, fully-functioning organ.  The foreskin, like any other
genital part is a valuable body part.

NOHARMM and RECAP Meetings
RECAP and NOHARMM of San Francisco meet at the Metropolitan Community Church,
150 Eureka (between 18th and 19th St.) the first Sunday of every month
(except July, the 10th).   RECAP  ((510) 827-4077) a support group for men
who are undergoing foreskin restoration or otherwise dealing with the damage
done by circumcision, meets from 13:00-15:00. NOHARMM (National Organization
to Halt the Abuse and Routine Mutilation of Males) ((415) 826-9351), a group
especially for men--but open to all--to organize and fight back against the
practice which we were helpless to defend ourselves from as infants or small
children meets at 15:30.

ON LINE FORUM LAUNCHED
Our friend Al Fields of Pennsylvania writes (via E-Mail):  
"I am in the process of establishing a custom forum, Men Against
Circumcision, on the Delphi on ilne service.  Access to the forum is by
application which prevents 'flamers' from posting unwanted messages.  In
addition I have control over the messages and can delete any message no
appropriate.  The purpose of the forum is to provide information in the fight
against routine infant circumcision.  Any information I might share WOULD NOT
include any names and addresses of those individuals working for the cause.
 Anyone who belongs to delphi can gain access to the forum by E-Mailing me
(albfie), then entering at any promot 'go cus 175.'
"Earlier this year I worked with Gary Burlingame in establishing an Internet
Restoring mail list.  This is a great way for restoring men to share when
there is no local support group.  You can join the list by sending a message
to rest-lib @ mit.edu.  This is not an automated subscription package so
please include a message indicating that you would like to join.  The
addition will not take place until the day after you have been added.  You
can join the list by sending to: rest @ mit.edu.  Gary Burlingame, n7044623 @
henson.cc.wwu.edu." 

compleat mother
When someone saw Jody McLaughlin at the Third International Symposium on
Circumcision in Marilyand, he commented about her magazine being the best of
its kind in the world.  "Wrong," she corrected him, "It's the best magazine
in the world."  She may be right.  What could be better for humanity than
natural home birth, breast-feeding, family beds, and non-circumcision?  Send
$12 and for a copy of the Spring '94 issue and a 1-year subscription starting
Summer '94.  Compleat Mother, c/o 3865 Duncan Place, Palo Alto, CA 94306.

"AWAKENINGS": 
A PRELIMINARY POLL OF CIRCUMCISED MEN
Full report available from  NOHARMM  P.O. Box 460795  San Francisco, CA
 94146.
 
A grassroots ongoing national survey was undertaken of circumcised men who
are aware of being harmed to some degree by infant circumcision.  This was
done in view of the fact that there have been no previous formal scientific
studies of the adverse long-term consequences to men of this surgery.
 Questionnaires were formulated based on the types of harm described by men
who had corresponded with circumcision information organizations during a ten
year period.  The questionnaires were mailed upon request and to men who had
contacted foreskin restoration groups.  Others were requested by men as a resu
lt of learning about the survey through the media.
 
The physical, sexual and psychological effects were compiled in 1993 from 313
men who responded to the survey. Demographic data was collected only on birth
year, birth state, state of residence, race, religion and age at
circumcision.  Following is a partial demographic overview and a statistical
review.

Race:  White: 96.8%, African-American: 0.3%, Hispanic: 1.3%, Asian:0.3%,
American Indian: 0.3%, Other:1%

Religion:  Christian: 77.3%, Jewish: 4.2%, Moslem: 0%, Other (Atheist,
Buddhist, etc.): 18.5%

Age: (Average Age: 42)  Under 19: 1%, 20-29: 13.1%, 30-39: 26.8%, 40-49:
33.9%, 50-59: 16%,     Over 60: 9.3%

Age at Circumcision:  Infancy: 89.1%, 1-12: 6.1%, 13-17: 1%, Over 18: 3.8%

Some of the adverse effects reported by survey respondents included:
-prominent scarring (29%) 
-skin tags (11.8%) and skin bridges (9.9%)
-meatal stenosis (constricted urinary opening) 
-recurrent non-specific urethritis
-progressive glans insensitivity (55.3%) 
-circumcised too tightly (26.8%)
-excess stimulation needed to orgasm* (38%) 
-impedence to sexual relations (42.5%)
-painful erections (11%) from excessive skin loss 
-dissatisfaction with circumcision (69%)
-low-self esteem or inferiority to intact men (47.3%) 
-lack of natural wholeness (60%)
-anger over being circumcised (54.3%) 
-resentment over the surgery (60.4%)
-feelings of parental violation (49.5%), mutilation (62%), or betrayal
(33.9%)
(* often to the point of discomfort or pain to themselves or their partner)

The survey found that over 60% of respondents had not sought professional
help for their harm, mostly because they felt no recourse was available
(39.3%), were embarrassed (19.8%) or feared ridicule (15.7%).  Half the
respondents (50.2%) are involved in uncircumcision (foreskin restoration)
methods.  Almost 98% of the respondents felt there should be some form of
penalty for surgeons who amputate the healthy foreskin from an infant unable
to consent to the elective surgery.
 
The report does not claim to be a random sampling.  Hammond states it would
be difficult under current conditions to get such a sampling in a culture
where many men are led to believe infant circumcision may be beneficial, do
not yet know how to identify such harm, believe such adverse effects may be
"normal," or otherwise deny that harm exists.  Using birth and circumcision
data, the group conservatively estimates that between 1940 and 1990, well
over 66 million male infants were circumcised in the U.S.  It also notes that
while the American Academy of Pediatrics has stated that the circumcision
complication rate is 0.06%, the AAP acknowledges that "the exact incidence of
postoperative complications is unknown."  An October 1993 British Journal of
Surgery article however, noted that a realistic figure is 2%-10%.  According t
o Hammond, "This means between 1.3 and 6.6 million American males born in
that period carry some form of circumcision complication, with an as yet
unstudied incidence of related sexual or psychological harm."
 
Hammond hopes the NOHARMM survey will provide a foundation for further
research.  He also noted that an independent body image survey conducted in
1992 by the men's quarterly Journeymen, found that 20% of its circumcised
male respondents expressed dissatisfaction with their circumcision, versus
only 3% of intact men describing dissatisfaction.  The as yet unpublished
study also found that 78% of intact male respondents were happy with their
intact status against only 38% of satisfied circumcised males, leaving a
sizable 41% of circumcised men indecisive about how they view the procedure.
 Hammond says this lends credibility to the NOHARMM survey and the need to
study long-term consequences to men of infant circumcision.

SAMPLE COMMENTS FROM RESPONDENTS TO THE AWAKENING SURVEY
[comments followed by state of residence and birth year]

I've been mutilated and denied full functioning of my penis due to an
unnecessary and ignorant procedure. CA/1951
My penis is unnatural this way! OH/1956         
Constant, continual chafing and desensitization of glans. OR/1953
I enjoy no sensations on shaft or glans; orgasm requires painful thrusting.
 My sexual life is indeed ruined! OH/1966
Painful erections, scar tissue, insecure (don't feel complete).NY/1966
My penis has two skin shades, scar much lighter than the shaft. MA/1956
Taking away a part of my body without my permission is a violation of my body
and rights. OH/1954
The physical scar is hideous but the emotional scar equates to rape. CA/1947
Have to be at point of abuse and pain to my penis to reach orgasm, it is so
desensitized from circumcision. WA/1954
I am angry and bitter and depressed by being circumcised and I resent that it
was done to me. MA/1950
The mutilation happened when I was developing a close bond with my mother.  I
feared closeness because I believed pain would follow. MN/1958
Left with a sense of impotence and powerlessness and a fear about the power
of others to hurt me grievously. NY/1930
I experienced continuous decline in sensitivity and sexual pleasure to the
point of not being able to orgasm within a period of time comfortable to my
wife.  Fortunately, all this has been reversed by my foreskin recovery and I
once again have the sexual performance of a teenager.  CA/1945
Scars still bleed to this day.  Takes too long to orgasm due to desensitizing
of head. MI/1958
I have always suffered great irritation, redness to the meatus of my penis
due to lack of foreskin protection. NJ/1962
My penis curves left from uneven circumcision. MA/1953     Glans is calloused
and numb to subtle sensations. UT/1950
It hurts too much and sometimes bleeds from being cut so tight. NE/1943
Missing needlessly a vital part of my sexual anatomy, the only moving part.
OK/1923
[This gentlemen adds: Any physician using cosmetic surgery for health
purposes should be exposed as a fraud!]
Skin bridge, large, around 25% of glans-shaft. NJ/1930            
A deep longing to be complete and intact. GA/1953
 
Hammond hopes the NOHARMM survey will provide a foundation for further
research.  He also noted that an independent body image survey conducted in
1992 by the men's quarterly Journeymen, found that 20% of its circumcised
