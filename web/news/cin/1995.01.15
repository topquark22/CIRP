"WOMEN'S BODIES, WOMEN'S WISDOM:  Creating Physical and Emotional Health and
Healing":  A book by Christiane Northrup, M.D., Ob/Gyn, Bantam Books, 1994.
Following are excerpts from the section on circumcision from this new book.

"Circumcision of baby boys is another example of a painful procedure that is
unnecessary.  Circumcision is a perfect example of the triumph of emotion and
outdated and unproven beliefs over common sense and scientific data that it
is unnecessary.  Dr. George Dennison sums up the circumcision issue very
nicely:  'To me the idea of performing 100,000 mutilating procedures on
newborns to possibly prevent cancer in one elderly man is absurd.'

"The discussion of circumcision is a perfect example of the strength and
influence of first chakra tribal programming on our thought and emotional
responses.  This programming is so ingrained that many people cannot even
discuss the subject of circumcisions without guilt, denial, or other strong
emotions.  I know that even addressing the subject of the baby boy's bodily
integrity, choices, and pain if the procedure is done can cause a 'kill the
messenger' reaction.  But first chakra programming can be successfully
questioned and worked through, if desired.  Many Jewish couples have
rethought the entire circumcision issue and have decided not to have it done
to their sons.

"I've seen circumcisions done in the delivery room.  Welcome to the world,
baby boy--now to initiate you properly, we're going to cut off one of the
most sensitive parts of your body with no anesthesia!  Circumcision is known
to cause sleep disturbances for at least three days.  I believe that it also
has profound implications for male sexuality that I can't begin to address
adequately in this book.  In fact, it's a form of sexual abuse.  We certainly
feel that way about female clitoridectomy, circumcision, and infibulation,
but we justify male infant circumcision by pretending that the babies don't
feel it because they're too young and it will have no consequences when they
are older.

"The foreskin is a highly innervated part of the body.  There is no doubt
that circumcision 'toughens' the delicate skin of the tip of the penis.  Men
who have been circumcised later in life and who therefore know the difference
report a decrease in their sexual sensations.  One of my friends who is NOT
circumcised says that he wonders if rape is less common in countries in which
the men are not circumcised.  His experience is that having intercourse with
a woman who isn't aroused and well-lubricated is as painful for him as it is
for her because of the delicacy of the foreskin!" 

READERS RESPOND
I have more than an interest in this, I'm an anesthetist, uncircumcised.  My
son is now a physician, uncircumcised, as is his son.  I've been battling
this most of my career, and often talked new mothers "out of it" right in the
delivery room, particularly if they had epidural or saddle block anesthesia.
The obstetricians used to get pissed at me.  I guess I was taking $$$ right
out of their filthy wallets.  

You may include my name if you think it would serve any purpose.  There are
more nurses than you might suspect that actively "sabotage" the doctor's boy
baby ritual.  I've had many team
up with me, and vice-versa.  They spend more-time with mothers-to-be, and
with post-partum mothers, and can, and often do, prevent it.  The days of
"yes, Doctor" are over.  I know nurse- midwives who tell the mother there
will be no circumcision, right from the time they take over their pre-natal
care.  They have a lot of teaching to do, but that too is part of their job.
Strange, isn't it, that women are our protectors, and allies, right from the
git-go.  How soon some of us forget.

DOCUMENT CIRCUMCISERS WHO HARASS PARENTS
Case #1:  After sending three registered letters to the physician, nursing
staff and hospital administration stating she did not want her son
circumcised, one mother was told by the doctor the day after her son's birth
that he was "in line" for circumcision!  Despite her weakened state, the
upset mother raised enough fuss that the doctor (perplexed and visibly
annoyed) retrieved the baby from the "assembly line."  

Case #2:  After repeatedly being asked by her doctor to explain her decision
not to circumcise her soon-to-be-born son, upon the boy's birth the doctor
inquired: "Now you sure we're not going to circumcise him?"  

Case #3:  Despite verbal declarations that their son was not to be
circumcised, and the father going so far as to hang a "No Circumcision" sign
on their son's bassinet, this couple's son was still circumcised by the
hospital!  

Case #4:  One mother calmly and confidently explained to her physician that
her newborn son was not to be circumcised, but the doctor flew into a rage
and berated the new mother for being neglectful.  

Do you know of an incident where the parental decision not to circumcise has
been ignored, a decision has been eroded by hospital staff, or parents have
been outright intimidated?  NOHARMM is collecting evidence for a potential
media or Congressional investigation into medically unethical behavior and
malpractice.  Written documentation must include description of incident,
hospital, date of incident, name and address of parents, and what action
parents took (if any).  Optionally, but preferably, include name of the
doctor(s) and/or nurse(s) involved.  Expose circumcisers who harass parents!
