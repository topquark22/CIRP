DR. EDELL ON CIRCUMCISION
The September issue of Men's Fitness featured several pages of an interview
with Dr. Dean Edell under Physician's Forum.  Dr. Edell was asked, "Is it
true that uncircumcised men are more prone to sexually transmitted disease
than circumcised men?"  Answer:

"The classic [medical] literature has said 'yes.'  But in the past,
uncircumcised men were often of a lower social class and had different sexual
and hygiene habits.  The newer literature is based on adult men who weren't
circumcised 20 or 30 years ago, so you're still talking about a different
period in history.  It's very difficult to assess.  But I've never seen
anything dirtier than a vagina, and no one's suggested removing them.
Sexually transmitted diseases come, obviously, from having unprotected sex."

HUSTLING AND PLAYING WITH FORESKINS
Hustler magazine, September 1994, has an ad on page 147 for a vibrator wih a
"'foreskin' [that] rolls back like an uncircumcised penis" and an ad on page
159 for a vibrator "with somethnig extra...now you can experience the feeling
of natural, moving foreskin."  [Batteries not included.]
Playgirl, October 1994, has an ad on page 98 for a vibrator with a "soft
ebony 'foreskin' [that] rolls back like an uncircumcised penis."  It appears
as though the value of the foreskin is catching on.

A NURSE SAYS NO TO CIRCUMCISION
Following is a message, slightly edited for brevity and clarity, from a
nurse, whose identifying information has been witheld for reasons of
confidentiality and to protect this nurse against retribution by the OBS or
the hospital.  

"I have been a neonatal nurse for 9 years.  Our obstetricians do our
circumcisions.  Only one will 'speak out' against them as unnecessary.
While the others may agree, little attention is paid to informing and
educating parents about this procedure.  While the vast majority of our
circs go 'well,' if one can call it that, there are those exceptions that
are so heartbreaking.  Unfortunately in my area, it is usually the same
OB's who end up with the 'butchered' results!  These are the babies whom I
am SO very concerned!  Colleagues should NOT allow that to continue!  They
treat it like a mere "BOO-BOO"!  It is not THEIR penises that have been
slashed and mutilated!  We have called attention to it more than once in a
professional manner. What is the big deal about an OB just saying he/she
needs to learn another (simpler) method or just refusing to do it
altogether?  An ego is a small price to pay for an infant's innocent
'surgical procedure' gone bad!  The Boys' Club needs to rethink their
priorities!  Ironically, one of these 'boys' is a female that just can't
seem to take constructive criticism from anyone. 

"Colleagues should step in for the sake of the infants!  I don't think a
review board is the answer because the infants go home so quickly now and
there is just no consistent follow-up.  Thanks for letting me ventilate as
well as share with you from this area of the wonderful world of
baby-nursing!"

CIN AT YOUR SERVICE
A reader recently sent an E-mail message to CIN.  His three-year-old intact
son had a condition with his foreskin which was harmless, but a source of
concern.  His urologist, typically American, strongly recommended
circumcision in order to prevent future potential problems.  CIN recommended
that the reader find another doctor, and put him in touch with several
information resources in his area and with a doctor who knows better.  If you
have any questions or problems, don't hesitate to contact us.  We'll either
have an answer or guide you to one.
