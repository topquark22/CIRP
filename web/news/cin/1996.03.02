Dear Friends,

In preparation for the 4th International Symposium on Sexual Mutilation at
the University of Lausanne, 9-11 August 1996, NOCIRC is mounting an
international publicity campaign.  The purpose of the symposium is to tell
the world what is happening to our children and to enlist world support to
save our children from the threat of sexual mutilation.  Europeans are
largely unaware that circumcision is even practiced in the United States.
 International pressure will help the American medical community to stop this
practice.

NOCIRC will be placing several detailed and beautifully designed
advertisements in the internationally acclaimed science journal Nature.  They
will appear in the April 21 and March 11 issues of Nature.  Nature has a
regular international readership of 400,000.  In addition, the issues in
which our ads will appear will be distributed gratis to the attendees of
three separate international medical conferences, one in Zurich, one in
Washington, DC, and one in Vancouver.  This means that an additional ten to
twenty thousand North American and European physicians and science
professionals will see the ad, learn about the issue, learn about the
Symposium, and be enticed to attend.

NOCIRC needs your help to pay for these important ads.  We need a total of
$1,170.00 by March 10 to make this important publicity campaign possible.
 The success of the symposium is dependent upon enlisting international
support in order to strengthen the world-wide movement against the genital
mutilation of our children.

Please give generously.  All contributions are tax deductible.  Together we
can make this happen.  The cost of the Nature  advertisements is a small
price to pay for the first step towards the world-wide eradication of genital
mutilation.  Please send your contribution to NOCIRC [see address below], and
please remember to write "Nature Project" on your check.

For the Children,

Frederick Hodges,
Special Projects Director

THE PREPUCE, SPECIALIZED MUCOSA OF THE PENIS, AND ITS LOSS TO CIRCUMCISION

Ridged and smooth mucosal surfaces

When retracted, the inner surface of the prepuce displays two zones, 'ridged'
and 'smooth' (Fig. 3).  The first, a transversely-ridged band of mucosa 10-15
mm wide, lies against the true skin edge, forming the outer surface of the
tip of the prepuce.  In the dorsal midline. the 'ridged band' lies above the
level of the adjacent 'smooth' mucosa and merges smoothly, on either side,
with the frenulum of the prepuce.  When magnified, the ridged mucosa has a
pebbled or coral-like appearance.  Unretracted. the adult 'ridged band'
usually lies flat against the glans; retracted, the 'ridged band' is everted
on the shaft of the penis.  The remainder of the preputial lining between the
'ridged band' and the glans is smooth and lax.  There is considerable
variation in the degree of ridging:  older subjects showed less and younger
subjects more marked ridging.  Some ridging was seen in all the prepuces
examined (Figs 4-6).  The intense vascularity of the 'ridged band' was best
seen in transilluminated mucosa (Fig. 7).

Mucsoal histology

The inner surface of the prepuce is lined by variably-keratinized squamous
epithelium similar to frictional mucosa of the mouth. vagina and oesophagus.
 The epithelium is papillated by stromal or 'corial' tissue and is rich in
nerves, Schwann cells, lymphoid cells and capillaries.  Papillae are
continuous with a highly vascular, loose-knit tissue layer that resembles the
corium of oral mucosa.  Perputial musosa also lacks the dense collagenous
zone seen in most areas of true (skin) dermis and, again unlike true skin of
the penile shaft and outer surface of the prepuce, the mucosal surface of the
prepuce is completely free of lanugo hair folicles, sweat and sebaceous
glands.  Smooth muscle bundles are common to both shaft skin and preputial
mucosa.

Histological cross-sections of the 'ridged band' showed focal, spiky or more
rounded, broader and flatter ridges interspersed with sulci.  Meissner's
corpuscles were more plentiful in some subjects than in others but
significantly they were only seen in the crests of ridges, occasionally in
small clumps that expanded the tips of corial papillae [Fig.8]  End-organs
were not seen in suIci between ridges in this material.  S100 staining (Fig.
9) showed additional end-organs and myelinated nerve fibres within papiliae
and confirmed the richly innervated nature of the 'ridged band'.  The
distribution of Meissner's corpuscles in the mucosal ridges was best seen in
tangential sections through the epithelium and tips of corial papillae of
some but not all specimens. Sections of 'smooth mucosa' showed no ridging of
the mucosal surface, slightly shallower corial papillae and few Meissner's
corpuscles.  Meissner's corpuscles were seen in the frenulum and glans but no
attempt was made to compare smooth with deeply ridged mucosae.
 Histologically, no clear demarcation line can be drawn between true skin of
the penile shaft and the 'ridged band' at the precise tip of the prepuce.

SCREAM OF THE WEEK 
(Statements Documenting Infant Circumcision Pain)
Submitted by Johnny4444@aol.com

"I know that the circumcisions I have done, without exception, have been
painful for the baby.  In medical school I was taught that the baby's nervous
system is not developed sufficiently to be aware of the pain....But my
experience in doing it and observing the baby's reactions tell me otherwise."
 (Howard Marchbanks, MD [quoted], Circumcision: The Painful Dilemma, p. 133)
