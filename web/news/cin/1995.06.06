"The forced amputation of a healthy part of the genitals of an unconsenting
infant or child, whether in the name of medicine, religion, or social custom,
is a human rights violation."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE--PRESS CONFERENCE

WHEN: Monday, 12 June 1995 at 10:00 AM.

WHERE: Santa Fe Imaging Center, Symposium Room, 1640 Hospital Drive.

WHAT: Founding of NURSES FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD, a national, locally
based nonxprofit organization to protect unconsenting infants and children
from the surgical alteration of their genitals.

WHY: Local nurses opposed to routine circumcision of newborns organized years
ago to protect the basic right of infant males to an intact body.  In October
1992, twentyxfour maternalxchild nurses at St. Vincent Hospital, Santa Fe,
New Mexico, declared themselves conscientious objectors to infant
circumcision.  In January 1995 their status as conscientious objectors was
secured by a legally binding hospital document, the "Memorandum of
Understanding for Circumcision Procedure."   With this accomplishment behind
them, and to establish an identity apart from St. Vincent Hospital, several
of the nurses have formed NURSES FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD to promote their
work protecting children on a national level.

GOALS OF THE ORGANIZATION:
* to empower, support and advise other nurses nationxwide who want to stop
participating in the sociallyxsanctioned genital mutilation of minors.

* to act as human rights advocates for babies and children by informing and
educating the public that the forced amputation of a healthy part of the
genitals of an unconsenting infant or child, whether in the name of medicine,
religion or social custom, is a human rights violation.

* to offer expectant parents information and prenatal classes on
circumcision.

* to network with other individuals and groups who are working in this
country and abroad to promote the rights of children to bodily integrity.

* to promote the human rights principles of the United Nations, especially as
expressed in UN General Assembly Resolution 44125, 20 November 1989,
"Convention on the Rights of the Child."  --Contributed by F.H., B.E., and

HALT ROUTINE CIRCUMCISIONS, NURSES URGE
The Vancouver Sun, Monday, 10 April 1995
by Rattan Mall

The routine circumcision of male babies was condemned by the province's
registered nurses at their annual convention in Vancouver.
  
The preamble of a resolution passed by a majority of nurses said male
circumcision is a procedure without demonstrable medical benefits in the vast
majority of cases.  The procedure is also not recommended by the Canadian
Pediatrics Association.
  
The nurses also agreed Friday that routine circumcision has numerous
complications that are rarely communicated to parents, and that most medical
authorities worldwide believe newborn males have a right to remain intact
except in rare instances.
  
And they believe nurses have a role to play in educating parents about the
perils of circumcision.
  
The resolution was introduced at the convention by the New Westminster
chapter of the Registered Nurses' Association of B.C.  Before being passed,
it was amended to include both sexes.  The phrase "routine infant male
circumcision" was replaced with "non-therapeutic circumcision."
  
"It's circumcision of all forms on all sexes and so it makes it quite open,"
Iva Phillips, a registered nurse from Victoria, said Sunday.  "And what it
emphasizes is the role of the nurses and the association in raising awareness
regarding this procedure."
  
Last year, the issue proved too controversial and a similar resolution was
withdrawn.
  
John Cox said Sunday the resolution passed Friday asked the board of
directors and individual
members of the nurses' association to help raise public awareness about the
risks of non-therapeutic circumcision.
  
It also asked the board of directors and the Canadian Nurses' Association to
develop positions
regarding the role of nurses in non-therapeutic circumcision, said Cox,
director of public relations for the nurses' association.
  
Said Cox: "I am sure that there will be some kind of a statement made that
will clarify what the nurses' role is and this will, I think, help create a
higher level of understanding."
  
The board of directors is expected to consider the resolution at its next
meeting June 8."  

CIRCUMCISION TO BE ADDRESSED ON STAGE
My movement theater performance piece, "Seeing in Black and White, Seeing in
Color," which addresses circumcision as a principal issue, is going to be
performed at various places in the Bay Area in the coming months.  I am
opening at Shotwell Studios, 3252 19th Street at Shotwell, San Francisco on
9-11 June.  It will also be at Tongue and Groove, and at 3110 Adeline,
Oakland on Sunday, 23 July at 19:00.  Times for Shotwell Studios are 20:30 on
the 9th and 10th and 19:30 on the 11th.

I just came back from the first performance of my life at the California
Men's Gathering in Malibu, and the piece got extremely good feedback.  There
is a video of it and I will be shooting other videos in case anyone is
interested!

Come see it!  Call (415) 824-8230, write to 3425 19th Street, San Francisco,
CA 94110 or E-mail me at svoboda @ igc.apc.org if any questions.  --Steve
