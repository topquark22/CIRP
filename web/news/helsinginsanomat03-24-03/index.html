            Legislation under preparation at Ministry of Social
            Affairs and Health</p>

            <dl>
              <dd>Finnish university hospitals have received
              instructions from the <a
              href="http://www.vn.fi/stm/english/index.htm"
              target="_blank">Ministry of Social Affairs and
              Health</a> and the <a
              href="http://www.kuntaliitto.fi/english/indexeng.htm"
              target="_blank">Association of Finnish Local and
              Regional Authorities</a>, urging public health care
              facilities to provide circumcisions for boys whose
              families want the procedure.</dd>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>The purpose of the move is to avert complications
              that might result from religiously mandated
              circumcisions performed by untrained people, which
              often involve poor hygiene and inadequate
              anaesthesia.<br />
               &nbsp;<br />
              </dt>

              <dd><b>The letter was sent</b></dd>

              <dt>because Finland currently has no legislation on
              circumcisions. Now a bill on the procedure is under
              preparation at the Ministry of Social Affairs and
              Health.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>Ministry official <b>Marja-Liisa Partanen</b>
              says that the issue will be examined while the
              present minister is still in office, before a new
              government takes over.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>"Probably a small law will be passed on this
              issue, because it is difficult to link this with our
              law on public health. After all, this is not a
              question of actual health care", Partanen says.<br />
              <br />
              </dt>

              <dd><b>The problem is not</b></dd>

              <dt>a very extensive one. There are no precise
              figures on the number of circumcisions performed on
              boys in Finland, but Partanen estimates that it might
              be about 100 a year.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>All religious-based circumcisions performed in
              hospitals are for Muslims. Finland's Jewish community
              has its own specialists who perform the procedure
              under hygienic conditions.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>The basis of the letter and the legislative
              preparations is an <a
              href="/news/helsinkinews08-21-01/">incident</a> in
              Kuopio in 2001 when an African-born doctor performed
              circumcisions on seven boys at home, several of whom
              were later hospitalised for complications. The
              criminal investigation in the case is expected to be
              completed next week.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt><span class="yellow">The case could set a
              precedent as to whether such circumcisions constitute
              assault.</span></dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>The letter sent to hospitals urges doctors to
              perform circumcisions on patients who ask for one.
              The purpose is to avoid complications that might
              result from procedures performed in the home.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>According to <b>Ritva Larjomaa</b> of the
              Association of Finnish Local and Regional
              Authorities, <span class="yellow">a doctor with
              ethical objections to performing circumcisions cannot
              be forced to do it.</span></dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt><span class="yellow">As the procedure is not a
              medical one, some doctors have refused to perform it,
              saying that it violates the physical integrity of the
              child.</span> Larjomaa says that on the same basis a
              church minister might refuse to baptise a child.</dt>

              <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>

              <dt>"We should also not create a situation in which
              public health care does not operate, but the private
              sector does", Larjomaa emphasises.<br />
               &nbsp;<br />
              </dt>

              <dd><b>Circumcision patients</b></dd>

              <dt>must queue for the procedure just like all
              patients needing minor surgery. The price of the
              procedure is the same as for all types of day surgery
              provided by hospitals: slightly more than 100 euros.
              After the operation the patient can go straight
              home.</dt>
