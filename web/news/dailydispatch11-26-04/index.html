            <h2>Circumcision unrest terrifies village teachers</h2>

            <p>By Mayibongwe Maqhina</p>

            <p>EAST LONDON - Teachers at Msobomvu High School at
            Zikhova near Chalumna fear for their lives as violence
            among village youths intensifies during the
            circumcision period.</p>

            <p>The teachers' spokesman, Mzwandile Funeka, said they
            were also concerned about vandalism at their unfenced
            school.</p>

            <p>"For the past years there has always been fighting
            among learners from the villages surrounding the
            school.</p>

            <p>"This fighting continues even in school premises,
            especially during the circumcision period," the
            teachers said in a joint statement.</p>

            <p>"We as teachers of Msobomvu are feeling threatened
            about the situation of our school."</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">The teachers said whenever it
            was time for circumcisions, in June and November,
            vandalism and violence at the school became more
            prevalent.</span></p>

            <p>The school provides education for five villages:
            Zikhova, Ngqinisa, Manzikhanyi, Kampini and
            KwaDowu.</p>

            <p>Funeka said it had become normal for windows and
            doors to be broken, and electricity cables and
            blackboards to be damaged.</p>

            <p>It was easy for anyone to get into the school's
            premises as there was no fencing.</p>

            <p>"Thugs come to the school at anytime. If there was
            fencing not everybody could get in.</p>

            <p>"We live in fear as teachers. We appeal for fencing
            for the school," he said, adding that the violence was
            also beyond the school governing body, which had tried
            to normalise the situation.</p>

            <p>The governors had decided that incidents of violence
            and vandalism would be reported to the police.</p>

            <p>Indeed, there have been several cases reported to
            the police and arrests were made in June last year.</p>

            <p>On November 19 learners who did not come to
            examinations disturbed those who sat the tests.</p>

            <p>Last weekend a matric learner, Mkhokeli Songezo,
            died, apparently as a result of unrest, especially
            among youths from the five villages who are undergoing
            circumcisions.</p>

            <p>Several attempts to reach Education Department
            spokesman Gay Khaile were unsuccessful.</p>
