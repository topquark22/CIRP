            <p>ANSA) - Bari, July 22 - A two-month old boy died
            Tuesday after a circumcision carried out at the home of
            his Nigerian-born parents.<br />
            <br />
             The baby was rushed to a Bari hospital after the
            rudimentary operation went wrong but died of a
            haemorrhage, police said.<br />
            <br />
             Judicial sources said judges were weighing whether to
            place the boy's 24-year-old mother under investigation
            for manslaughter - along with the unidentified
            'surgeon' when he is caught.<br />
            <br />
             <span class="yellow">It was the second such case in
            the last two months.</span><br />
            <br />
             Commenting on the case, Fabio Ferri of Rome's <a
            href="http://www.ospedalebambinogesu.it/Portale2008/Default.aspx?IDon=1340"
             target="_blank">Bambino Gesu' Hospital</a> said <span
            class="yellow">circumcisions were even ''risky'' in
            hospital because of the high amount of blood in the
            penis.</span><br />
            <br />
             ''(The operation) should always be performed by
            experienced doctors in a hospital,'' he said.<br />
            <br />
             Souad Sbai of the Association of Moroccan Women in
            Italy said all Islamic boys in Italy were circumcised,
            with ''many'' having the operation at home and only a
            few going to the doctor.<br />
            <br />
             Sbai added that many girls were still being taken back
            to their countries of origin to be infibulated despite
            the practice being banned in Italy since 2006.<br />
            <br />
             ''The situation has decidedly changed for the better
            but we need more money for awareness programmes and to
            support infibulated women,'' she said.<br />
