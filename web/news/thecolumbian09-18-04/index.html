            case</h2>

            <p>Saturday, September 18, 2004<br />
             <b>By STEPHANIE RICE, Columbian staff writer</b></p>

            <p>A <a href="http://www.ridgefieldwash.com/"
            target="_blank">Ridgefield</a> man who allegedly
            performed a botched circumcision on his 8-year-old son
            pleaded not guilty Friday to second-degree assault of a
            child.</p>

            <p>Superior Court Judge <a
            href="http://www.ridgefieldwash.com/"
            target="_blank">Diane Woolard</a> accepted the
            not-guilty plea from Edwin B. Baxter, who initially
            told Woolard he did not understand the charge and then
            asked for a new court-appointed attorney.</p>

            <p>After a brief discussion with his attorney, Tony
            Lowe, Baxter returned to the bench and entered his
            plea.</p>

            <p>His trial was set for Nov. 8.</p>

            <p>Baxter is being held in the <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/sheriff/custody/Index.html"
             target="_blank">Clark County Jail</a> on $50,000
            bail.</p>

            <p>Clark County senior deputy prosecutor <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/pa/criminal/childabuse.html"
             target="_blank">Kim Farr</a> said he has been unable
            to track down members of Baxter's family, who have
            abandoned their rental home. Law enforcement and
            investigators from the state <a
            href="https://fortress.wa.gov/dshs/caoffices/internetapps/ca/display.asp?officeName=Vancouver%20DCFS"
             target="_blank">Department of Children and Family
            Services</a> also have been unsuccessful in finding the
            family.</p>

            <p>Baxter, 33, and his pregnant wife have nine
            children. The state has tried before to contact the
            family after receiving reports that none of the
            children attends school.</p>

            <p>Farr said he'll seek a court order to take
            depositions from Baxter's wife, who was home at the
            time of the incident, and the victim. If the defendant
            does not relay the word to his family that they are
            required to give depositions, then Farr said he'll
            consider asking for warrants for the wife and son to be
            arrested and kept in custody as material witnesses
            until the trial.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/thecolumbian09-05-04/">Baxter,
            a truck driver, was arrested Sept. 3</a> after he
            called 911 to report that <span class="yellow">his son
            was bleeding profusely in the family's bathroom.</span>
            Baxter allegedly said he tried to circumcise his son
            after reading biblical passages about the
            procedure.</p>

            <p>Farr said Baxter put a blanket and pillow in the
            bathtub to try and make his son comfortable.</p>

            <p>If convicted of second-degree assault, Baxter could
            face three years in prison.</p>
