            <h4>Circumcision is unnecessary</h4>

            <p>It is probably the most common operation in the U.S.
            today, performed about 1.5 million times a year. Yet
            doctors increasingly acknowledge that it is extremely
            short on medical justification. Circumcision has a long
            history. Ancient Egyptians may have been the first
            practitioners, possibly using it to mark slaves. Jews
            adopted it as a religious rite in observance of the
            covenant between God and Abraham. For many Jews today,
            circumcision of an infant boy is a joyous family
            celebration. In the U.S. the operation found favor in
            the late 1800s as a deterrent to masturbation, then
            popularly considered the source of much physical and
            mental illness. During World War II, military surgeons
            concluded that circumcision was necessary for hygiene,
            particularly in the tropics, and snipped the foreskins
            of uncircumcised soldiers and sailors. After the war,
            circumcising infant boys became routine, and not only
            for hygienic reasons. Circumcised males were said to be
            less susceptible to penile cancer and their sexual
            partners less likely to get cancer of the cervix.<br />
            <br />
             These justifications have gradually been debunked.
            Cleanliness can be assured by teaching a boy to wash
            his penis. Cancer of the penis, a very rare malignancy,
            occurs about equally in circumcised men and in those
            with foreskins intact who wash thoroughly. Studies
            indicating that women married to circumcised men have a
            lower incidence of cervical cancer have been either
            inadequate or flawed. Review of one study, for example,
            revealed that about half the women had incorrectly
            answered questions regarding whether their husbands
            were circumcised. A sizable portion of the men were
            also wrong in assessing their condition. Circumcision
            will correct two conditions that occur in a fraction of
            uncircumcised children: phimosis, a narrowing of the
            foreskin hampering erection and urination; and
            paraphimosis, retraction of the foreskin resulting in a
            cutoff of blood to the end of the penis.<br />
            <br />
             The operation is done without anaesthetic, usually
            within the first two weeks of life, and is painful.
            Doctors also point out that there is some risk of
            infection and hemorrhage. One reason for the damage is
            that the operations are often performed by doctors who
            are not adept in the procedure. The American Academy of
            Pediatrics concluded in <a
            href="/library/statements/aap/#a1971"
            target="_blank">1971</a> and again in <a
            href="/library/statements/aap/#a1975"
            target="_blank">1975</a>: "There is no absolute medical
            indication for routine circumcision of the
            newborn."<br />
            <br />
             Still, the practice persists. Last year about 80% of
            newborn males in the U.S. were circumcised. Some
            parents think the law or hospital requires the
            operation. Many choose circumcision so that the baby
            will look like Daddy or siblings. Clearly, doctors have
            not done too vigorous a job of informing parents of
            their option. Says one critic: "Who's going to pass up
            75 bucks for three minutes' work?"<br />
            <br />
             Consumer groups are now taking up the slack. The
            Massachusetts Women's Council on Obstetrical Practices
            attempts to sway parents with a novel approach. It
            shows pictures of a circumcision in progress while
            playing a record of the baby's screams.</p>
