            circumcision</h2>

            <p>BRISBANE, Australia, Oct 8 1997 (AFP) - An court on
            Wednesday awarded a man 10,000 Australian dollars
            (7,400 US) for nervous shock after a botched attempt to
            circumcise him with a broken beer bottle in a drunken
            attack.</p>

            <p>The Brisbane district court heard that Irwin
            Brookdale, 34, was drinking with a group of Aborigines
            on the banks of a river in far north Queensland state
            last year when he fell asleep and passed out.</p>

            <p>A woman with the group, "Gladys," felt down his
            pants and realising he was not circumcised, exhorted
            the others to "make a man out of him".</p>

            <p>"Which is what they proceeded to do on the banks of
            the Leichhardt (river) with a broken beer bottle they
            had smashed over rocks," Judge Fred McGuire said.</p>

            <p>"He was an uncomplaining type, but he ended up in
            hospital."</p>

            <p>Brookdale was forced to have a corrective
            therapeutic circumcision in hospital the next day.</p>

            <p>McGuire described the case as "puzzling" and said
            there was nothing similar to it that he could find in
            Australian legal history.</p>

            <p>He made the compensation award against Ambrose John
            Neal, who was convicted of unlawful wounding in June
            last year.</p>
