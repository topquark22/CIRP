            <h2>Circumcised men to probe deaths of initiates</h2>

            <p>by Boyd Webb</p>

            <p>A special task team (for the circumcised only) has
            been established by the National House of Traditional
            Leaders (NHTL) to investigate the deaths of initiates
            at circumcision schools.<br />
            <br />
             The task team, proposed by Chief Malesela Dikgale of
            Limpopo, was ordered to comprise only members who
            themselves have been initiated to avoid any possible
            embarrassment or problems during the
            investigation.<br />
            <br />
             More than 20 boys are thought to have died in
            initiation schools since the start of winter. A number
            have died from pneumonia while others starved to death
            or died as a result of injuries suffered during the
            initiation process.<br />
            <br />
             In calling for the team's establishment, Dikgale said
            the NHTL should be given a full report on what problems
            were experienced by the initiates.<br />
            <br />
            </p>

            <table width="130" border="0" cellspacing="6"
            cellpadding="0" align="left" summary="">
              <tr>
                <td><b>'It's casting this institution in a very bad
                light'</b></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>This, he felt, would serve to remove much of the
            sensationalism attached to the subject of initiation
            schools.<br />
            <br />
             "Some of the problems have ballooned, especially in
            Limpopo, where it was reported that 10 people have died
            at schools. But that is not true, only four people have
            died," he said during a special sitting of the NHTL in
            the Western Cape Legislature on Thursday.<br />
            <br />
             Dikgale said the investigation would serve to sift
            fact from fiction.<br />
            <br />
             Agreeing to the immediate need for an investigation,
            Free State Chief Mathealira Mopeli said the death of
            initiates was of great concern to the NHTL as it was
            casting aspersions on the practice.<br />
            <br />
             "It is a very noble practice but it's being abused,
            just like the practice of lobola, which is being
            commercialised in certain circles."<br />
            <br />
             North West Chief Molefe Pilane voiced his concern too.
            "It's casting this institution in a very bad light," he
            said.<br />
            <br />
             Supporting the move, Limpopo Chief Cypriane Ngove
            suggested the formation of a national database and the
            deployment in future of NHTL members to the provinces
            before the start of the circumcision season to monitor
            events.<br />
