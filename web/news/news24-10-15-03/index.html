            15/10/2003 16:00 - (SA) 

            <p>Addis Ababa - <span class="yellow">At least 350
            traditional circumcisers in northern Ethiopia's Gonder
            region have agreed to abandon the harmful practice as
            well as other forms of genital mutilation</span>, the
            Ethiopian News Agency (ENA) reported on Wednesday.</p>

            <p>"The circumcisers and those engaged in harmful
            traditional practices have decided to abandon them
            after intensive sensitisation work by health officers,"
            the agency said, quoting the Social Services Centre
            chief Abebaw Gegit in Gonder's Wored area as
            saying.</p>

            <p>"Some 530 other people engaged in circumcision and
            other cuttings of the genitals also expressed readiness
            to quit their practice and throw away the instruments
            of their trade," Abebaw said.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Ethiopian health officials have
            said that the HIV/Aids pandemic has been aggravated by
            traditional medical practices, as instruments often are
            not sterilised.</span></p>

            <p>ENA said preparations were being made to provide
            loans to those who abandon the trade to help them make
            a living in a different way.</p>

            <p>Traditional circumcision has long been practised in
            Ethiopia, mainly on young girls.</p>
