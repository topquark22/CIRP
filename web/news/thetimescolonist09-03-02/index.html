            <h2>Ending an unnecessary risk</h2>
            <i>Tuesday, September 03, 2002</i> 

            <p>Canada's doctors are becoming increasingly
            disenchanted with male circumcision. They think the
            health risks of the operation exceed its benefits.</p>

            <p>That view was tragically reinforced by the <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/theprovince08-29-02/">death
            of a B.C. infant</a> last week shortly after a
            circumcision. The death is under investigation by the
            <a href="http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/programs.htm#b"
            target="_blank">coroner's office</a> in Vancouver.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.quadrant.net/cpss/"
            target="_blank">College of Physicians and Surgeons in
            Saskatchewan</a> -- where 27.6 per cent of male
            children are circumcised -- says research doesn't
            support the practice, and the <a
            href="http://www.cpsbc.bc.ca/" target="_blank">B.C.
            College</a> is reviewing the issue.</p>

            <p>The doctors' Victorian predecessors would have been
            horrified. Circumcision of little boys was, like
            encasing them in plaster and castrating them, a
            standard cure for masturbation -- and that vile
            practice, as everyone knew, caused consumption,
            paralysis, heart disease, untidiness and sometimes
            suicide.</p>

            <p>It was better if the operation were performed
            without anesthetic, because the pain had a salutary
            effect on the mind, becoming associated later with
            physical punishment, itself a major resource in
            child-rearing.</p>

            <p>This medical justification for circumcision, of
            course, no longer applies now that masturbation is
            regarded as normal, even healthy, like jogging.</p>

            <p>The other medical justification for the operation --
            hygiene -- probably went out with the invention of
            soap. And the doctors today are warning that botched
            circumcisions can cause complications such as
            uncontrolled bleeding, amputation, renal failure,
            sepsis and even death.</p>

            <p>In the United States -- where else? -- there are
            litigious concerns. In <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/sacramento06-09-01/">California</a>,
            a court is deciding whether a baby who is circumcised
            can, upon reaching majority, secure damages from the
            doctors and hospital involved even when the parent has
            given consent that is "uninformed" -- that is, the
            parent didn't understand what was involved.</p>

            <p>There are, still, religious reasons for parents to
            opt for circumcision.</p>

            <p>Many parents will still seek the operation so their
            sons "look like daddy."</p>

            <p>Whatever their reasons for subjecting their children
            to the operation, parents should be told the risks so
            they may make an informed judgment.</p>

            <p>Circumcisions should no longer be regarded as
            routine and, one day, most daddies will look the
            same.</p>
