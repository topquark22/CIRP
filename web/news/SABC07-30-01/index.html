        <h2>New circumcision laws in pipeline</h2>

        <p>Johannesburg - A new law to regulate traditional
        initiation and circumcision procedures is in the pipeline
        after 250 boys attending initiation schools were
        hospitalised and 35 died, SABC television news reported on
        Sunday.</p>

        <p>This year's initiation season has now ended.</p>

        <p>In the wake of a trail of botched mutilations, the <a
        href="http://www.doh.gov.za/" target="_blank">Health
        Department</a> has vowed to take full control of the
        carrying out of these customary procedures before the next
        initiation season begins.</p>
