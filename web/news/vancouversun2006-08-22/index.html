            <h4>Paul Tinari, Special to the Sun</h4>

            <p>Published: Tuesday, August 22, 2006</p>

            <p>Re: Circumcision could cut AIDS toll, Aug. 16</p>

            <p>Trumpeting as a headline former U.S. president Bill
            Clinton's pro-circumcision statements made at the
            International Conference on AIDS is an insult to the
            intelligence of your readers.</p>

            <p>Why is the opinion of a politician with no medical
            or scientific background given so much weight?</p>

            <p>The fact is that nearly universal (non-consensual)
            circumcision has already been tried as a means of
            providing blanket protection to males from AIDS and
            other sexually transmitted diseases. The result was
            that the United States, with the highest rate of
            circumcision in the western world at 90 per cent, also
            experienced the highest rate of AIDS and other STD
            infections.</p>

            <p>The lowest rates for all of these infections remains
            the Scandinavian nations -- places where circumcision
            is virtually unknown (less than one per cent.) Today
            the Middle East is one of the areas of the globe where
            HIV infections are increasing rapidly. This is also an
            area where circumcision of both men (and many women) is
            essentially universal. It can be concluded that telling
            men that circumcision protects them against HIV
            infection is a disastrous epidemiological policy.</p>

            <p>The fact is that the research so ignorantly quoted
            by the former politician is virtually useless because
            of the enormous number of confounding factors in the
            studies.</p>

            <p>For example, the research did not address such
            important scientific questions such as: What is the
            rate of medical complications for circumcisions
            performed in the unhygienic conditions typical of
            Africa? Are the risks associated with circumcision
            greater than the risks associated with HIV infection?
            The cells of the labia are also susceptible to HIV
            infection, so what role does female circumcision play
            in reducing the rate of HIV infection? Is the
            well-known African propensity towards "dry intercourse"
            a factor in increasing the risk of HIV infection? What
            role do particular African cultural habits play in the
            rate of HIV infection?</p>

            <p>What could be the explanation for the endless
            obsession of many in the West for concentrating on
            non-consensual male circumcision as a central pillar in
            their anti-AIDS strategy in Africa?</p>

            <p>A similar campaign to "improve" the health of
            Africans was begun in the 1960s by multinationals
            intent with replacing natural breast feeding with
            profitable infant formula. The result was an
            unmitigated disaster.</p>

            <p>Similarly, it is certain that this poorly considered
            circumcision campaign would be rife with unintended
            consequences that would create far more suffering than
            by simply following a policy of not doing anything at
            all.</p>

            lives in Coquitlam.</p>
