            <p>HE was the apple of his mother's eye.<br />
            <br />
            So when 4-year-old Nui Jia Yuan died after a
            circumcision operation turned wrong in 2003, his mother
            was devastated.</p>

            <p>Madam Lim Mei Leng, 34, and her husband Nui Lian
            Seng, 37, filed a civil suit against the doctor who
            carried out the procedure.</p>

            <p>After four long years of legal proceedings, the
            defendant, Dr M Kubendran, admitted liability on 23 Apr
            this year.<br />
            <br />
            Yesterday, the awarded the couple RM20,100 ($9,000) in
            damages, plus all legal costs, reported the New Straits
            Times.<br />
            <br />
            But the couple said they are not satisfied with the
            result.<br />
            <br />
            Said Madam Lim: 'This money will not bring my son
            back.<br />
            <br />
            <b>'I want further action to be taken against them.
            They have robbed us of our little boy.'</b></p>

            <p>According to court papers, Jia Yuan was taken to a
            clinic in Banting, Selangor on 26 Mar 2003, after he
            complained of pain during urination.<br />
            <br />
            Dr Kubendran found a urinary tract infection, and
            advised the parents to bring the boy back two days
            later for a circumcision.<br />
            <br />
            On the day of the procedure, the doctor administered
            four injections - in Jia Yuan's arm, buttocks and
            private parts - before the operation.</p>

            <h5>DIES 3 HOURS LATER</h5>

            <p>Afterwards, the couple took their son home. The
            doctor had told them that their son would regain
            consciousness within four to five hours, reported The
            Star.<br />
            <br />
            <span class="yellow">But Jia Yuan never woke up.
            Instead, he died about three hours after he was sent
            home from asphyxia, said the autopsy
            report.</span><br />
            <br />
            His parents lodged a police report three days
            later.<br />
            <br />
            Jia Yuan was the third of four children. He has two
            older brothers and one younger sister.<br />
            <br />
            Madam Lim said that the pain of her son's death was so
            immense that she thought of taking her own life.<br />
            <br />
            She said: 'I often chant for my son, and do things for
            charity in his name. It is because of my other
            children's support that I'm alive.'<br />
            <br />
            Judge Albaishan Abdul Manan said that she had awarded
            the family RM10,000 for bereavement, the maximum amount
            under the Civil Law Act.<br />
            <br />
            The remainder was made up of funeral expenses and other
            costs.<br />
            <br />
            She rejected the family's claim for general damages, as
            the boy was young and not employed at the time of
            death.</p>
