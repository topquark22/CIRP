            <h2>Gullas&rsquo; Operation Tuli holds last leg in
            Talisay</h2>

            <p>by <b>Ferliza Contratista</b> June 1, 2003</p>

            <p>The fourth and final leg of Operation Tuli 2003 was
            held yesterday in Talisay City with over 300 boys
            getting free circumcision.</p>

            <p>Close to 1,200 boys have benefitted from the project
            of first district Rep. Jose Gullas that started in
            Carcar town with 300 boys circumcised on May 10. In
            Naga town 300 boys were circumcised on May 17, and in
            Minglanilla town 200 boys on May 24.</p>

            <p>The same 12-man team of physicians from the <a
            href="http://www.uv.edu/" target="_blank">University of
            the Visayas</a>, led by Dr. Herman Tecson, rendered
            free services to the boys coming from the various
            barangays of Talisay City.</p>

            <p>They were also joined by a medical team from the <a
            href="http://www.afp.mil.ph/">Armed Forces of the
            Philippines</a> Central Command, and by some physicians
            from the rural health unit with city health officer Dr.
            Lino Alanzado at the helm.</p>

            <p>Rep. Gullas was with his brother, Talisay City Mayor
            Eduardo Gullas, in overseeing the Tuli which had given
            the boys substantial savings since a circumcision at a
            private hospital would cost them between P500 and
            P800.</p>

            <p>Aside from free circumcision, the congressman also
            gave the circumcised boys pain relievers, vitamins and
            antibiotic medicines.</p>

            <p>The Operation Tuli, a yearly project of the
            congressman, cost Rep. Gullas P750,000 solely for
            medicines this year.</p>
