            <h2>New Challenges in Female Genital Mutilation
            Fight</h2>
            Gerald Businge 

            <p>Female circumcision is an economic activity and
            trained surgeons are doing it for money.</p>

            <p>Betty Cheptoek, 18, stands supported by crutches as
            people listen to her experience with female genital
            mutilation (FGM). Despite her disability, her parents
            could not spare her 'the horror of the knife.'</p>

            <p>Cheptoek is from the Sabiny tribe in Eastern Uganda,
            which circumcises young girls as tradition. Cheptoek
            had just started her S.1 when her father started
            pestering her to get ready for circumcision. Betty had
            made it clear that she was not going to get circumcised
            at any cost. She had watched the painful process and
            learnt about the dangers resulting from the act.</p>

            <p>When she returned home for the second term holiday,
            she was shocked to find everything ready for her
            circumcision. Two cows, three goats, two bags of millet
            and maize were ready to 'grace' the ceremony:</p>

            <p>"When I saw this, I went crying to my mother. I
            asked her how I could possibly handle FGM with my
            disability. I asked her to help me with some money so
            that I could run away from home," Cheptoek says.</p>

            <p>She ran to friends and relatives, from one home to
            another, fleeing every time it was discovered she is
            avoiding FGM. This affected her education, until she
            was introduced to the <a
            href="http://www.fgmnetwork.org/eradication/advocates/godparentsassoc.html"
             target="_blank">USA-Uganda Godparents Association</a>
            (USA-UGPA). She is among the 50 students being
            sponsored by the association after they escaped FGM.
            But there are thousands of young girls who are not able
            to run away from FGM.</p>

            <p>"We have more than 200 young girls applying to leave
            there homes and be catered for by USA-UGPA," says
            Erinah Rutangye, the project co-ordinator. FGM is a
            cultural practice among many tribes in Africa, despite
            many years of campaigns against it. Most campaigns
            centre on the health hazards of FGM, yet it is a
            serious human rights violation against women and
            children, as participants agreed at the recently
            concluded Women's World Congress at <a
            href="http://www.makerere.ac.ug/"
            target="_blank">Makerere University</a>.</p>

            <p>"Health complications come after the act. We have to
            tackle the act as a human rights abuse," says Margaret
            Katono, a Ugandan participant on the topic of gendering
            young voices.</p>

            <p>There are further complications in the campaign
            against FGM as the practice is taking on new forms.
            Prof. Ahmed of the Sudanese Network for the Abolition
            of FGM practice says some gynaecologists in Sudan have
            started an open campaign for what they are calling
            'Sharia Circumcision.'</p>

            <p>"That's why we formed the network to address the
            issue within a framework of children's and women's
            human rights as recognised by the international
            conventions," Ahmed says.</p>

            <p>Dr. Amna Hassan from Sudan says 89% of women in
            Sudan are infibulated (circumcised) despite years of
            vigorous campaigns. She calls for increased awareness
            and concerted community mobilisation to stop FGM.</p>

            <p>But she herself knows how mobilising against FGM can
            be disastrous: "At one time as I addressed people on
            the topic, stones were being thrown at me through the
            window. In another place after the address, an old man
            walked toward me as if he liked what I had told them,
            raised his club and hit my head hard. We have to get
            our communities to understand and accept that this
            campaign is for the good of the girls," Dr. Hassan
            says.</p>

            <p>Ali Chiku, from the Nyaturu tribe in Singida Region,
            Tanzania, where FGM is practiced, stresses the
            importance of involving parents in understanding the
            hazards of FGM to stop them from circumcising their
            daughters.</p>

            <p>She says while anti-FGM campaigns have centred
            successfully on convincing young girls against giving
            in to the circumcision as required by custom, pro-FGM
            traditional die-hards have devised means of beating the
            method.</p>

            <p>"We have found that parents who leant about these
            campaigns in schools start circumcising infants from
            0-2 years," says Chiku. "Educating young ones alone
            does not help if their parents are left behind," she
            emphasises. Increasingly, anti FGM campaigners are
            being hit with the realisation that they are touching
            the root of traditional entertainment and 'cherished'
            community ceremonies that some societies don't want to
            let go.</p>

            <p>To many such society members, especially elders,
            abolishing FGM is abolishing cause for cultural
            festivity and robbing parents of a chance to be
            honoured. That may explain why some societies want to
            cling on to the practice.</p>

            <p>In Uganda, USA-UGPA identified the strength of the
            above and they have designed projects as compensation
            and discourage parents against the vice.</p>

            <p>"We have realised people want to party, drink, eat
            and give presents at these ceremonies. Now we are
            giving presents to mothers who agree not to circumcise
            their daughters. We started off with a heifer and goats
            project. It is working, but we need more support," says
            Mrs. Balidawa, a participant and member of
            USA-UGPA.</p>

            <p>On the political front, some leaders have been noted
            as less committed to active campaigns against FGM. Dr.
            Hassan says: "Most government officials do not
            genuinely support the cause. Because it attacks their
            political bases."</p>

            <p>Jane Francis Kuka agrees with Dr. Hassan. Kuka, a
            former Ugandan minister, says campaigning against FGM
            affected her political career: "My opponents use it as
            a weapon against me. Elders were saying who is this
            woman to interfere with our culture," she says. In the
            last elections, Kuka lost.</p>

            <p>All this would not have been hard to deal with if it
            wasn't for the new FGM-related practices. In a bid to
            lessen the dangers of FGM without antagonising culture,
            milder forms of the practice have been noted.</p>

            <p>In Tanzania, according to a <a
            href="http://www.panoseasternafrica.org.ug/"
            target="_blank">PANOS</a>, May 2002 <a
            href="http://www.panos.org.uk/news/May2002/emergency_fgm_rescue_operation_f.htm"
             target="_blank">story</a>, in an effort to lessen the
            dangers of FGM in Mara Region, SACHITA, an NGO started
            a method of cutting off the clitoris "or slicing off
            the tip of the organ" nicknamed CCM style (Chama Cha
            Mapinduzi). This is in an attempt to make the practice
            modern and because it is difficult to make people
            completely give up the practice.</p>

            <p>"Though less invasive, CCM too can cause scarring
            and childbirth complications," Dr. Juma Kakomanga of
            Tarime District Hospital told PANOS. But activists say
            what matters is not the new name of FGM, but what it
            entails.</p>
