            <p>The toll in the Eastern Cape's winter circumcision
            season has risen to 11 with news of the deaths of
            another three boys.<br />
            <br />
             "The latest victim died a few hours ago at an
            initiation school at Qweqwe village outside Mthatha,"
            provincial health department spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo
            said on Thursday morning.<br />
            <br />
             "We suspect that it's because of a complication from a
            botched circumcision."<br />
            <br />
            </p>

            <table width="130" border="0" cellspacing="6"
            cellpadding="0" align="left" summary="">
              <tr>
                <td><b>Denied food</b></td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            He also said rescuers had found a would-be initiate
            dead when they discovered him and 21 other boys hidden
            in Pondoland's mountainous Ntabankulu region.<br />
            <br />
             The 17-year-old, who had not yet been circumcised, had
            apparently died of starvation, he said.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
             The boys had been kept in the mountains for more than
            three weeks and were denied food. The survivors were
            taken to hospital suffering from starvation.<br />
            <br />
             "They look like skeletons," he said.<br />
            <br />
             Kupelo said the health department would recommend a
            postmortem on the dead boy, and that a case of murder
            be opened.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
             

            <table width="130" border="0" cellspacing="6"
            cellpadding="0" align="left" summary="">
              <tr>
                <td><b>'They look like skeletons'</b></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>He said it was believed another 149 initiates and
            would-be initiates are still hidden in the
            region.<br />
            <br />
             The health department received a tip-off and spent the
            whole of Wednesday night searching for the boys, said
            Kupelo.<br />
            <br />
             "The area (where they are hidden) is very hard to
            reach and we might have to send helicopters."<br />
            <br />
             He said the bogus traditional healer responsible was
            expected to be arrested on Thursday.<br />
            <br />
             "We don't understand why a human being can do
            something like this. This is against the custom, it is
            contradicting custom," said Kupelo.<br />
            <br />
             Parents would be encouraged to lay charges against
            those responsible.<br />
            <br />
             "We cannot allow our children to be killed by
            opportunistic individuals in the name of custom... they
            are making the custom a laughing stock."<br />
            <br />
             It was reported earlier in the week that one initiate
            had been taken to hospital in East London in a critical
            condition with gangrene of his genitals.<br />
            <br />
             Police in the province are investigating charges of
            assault, running illegal initiation schools and
            illegally conducting circumcisions.<br />
            <br />
             Five illegal surgeons are facing criminal charges, and
            police are searching in the Transkei for at least
            another four. - Sapa</p>
