            <h2>Illegal circumcision schools shut down</h2>
            Ben Maclennan<br />
             June 24 2005 at 04:02PM 

            <p>Two would-be initiates have died in the Eastern Cape
            since the start of the winter circumcision season, the
            provincial health department said on Thursday.</p>

            <p>Spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/municipality/content.asp?PageID=742&amp;buster=2005%2F06%2F19+04%3A15%3A29+PM#"
             target="_blank">department</a> officials and police,
            working with traditional leaders, had raided and shut
            down several illegal initiation schools, arrested two
            traditional nurses and a surgeon, and were hunting down
            other surgeons who had circumcised boys illegally.</p>

            <p>When they raided an illegal school at Mgwenyane
            village in the Libode area on Wednesday, they arrived
            while circumcisions were being carried out on a group
            of 29 youths.</p>

            <p>"We witnessed a terrible thing. The man was
            circumcising these boys using one blade," he said.</p>

            <p>"This illustrates the reason the department has had
            to intervene in traditional circumcisions. What it
            means is that if the first boy out of the 29 is
            HIV-positive, the rest of the boys have probably been
            infected with the virus."</p>

            <p>He said only five circumcisions had been carried out
            by the time the authorities arrived. The surgeon had
            been taken into custody by the Libode police.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Kupelo said one initiation
            candidate died at the weekend of septicaemia at
            Engcobo, near Umtata, and another, from Sada near
            Queenstown, died as a result of dehydration on
            Monday.</span></p>

            <p>He said there would, however, be no prosecutions as
            a result of the deaths, as both boys had been attending
            legal schools. The Engcobo boy had been in the care of
            his parents when he died, and the Sada boy had been in
            hospital.</p>

            <p>Under the province's law on traditional
            circumcision, schools must be registered with the
            department, parental permission must be obtained, and
            surgeons must follow particular procedures.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said members of the public at Mdantsane had
            since Monday handed over to police three bogus surgeons
            who had been circumcising under-age boys in the
            area.</p>

            <p>"What is encouraging this year is the community
            calls to inform us of the wrongdoers in their areas,"
            he said.</p>

            <p>One of the calls had come from <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/municipality/content.asp?PageID=742&amp;buster=2005%2F06%2F19+04%3A15%3A29+PM#"
             target="_blank">health MEC Monwabisi Goqwana</a>'s
            home village, Cingo, in the Tsolo area, where in a raid
            on Tuesday night authorities rescued 11 boys and
            arrested a traditional nurse.</p>

            <p>An enraged Eastern Cape businessman, Justice Zotwa,
            said that his 14-year-old nephew had been taken to an
            illegal circumcision school in the Bizana area without
            his parents' permission. - Sapa</p>
