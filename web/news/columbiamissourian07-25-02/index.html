            <p><b>&bull; &nbsp; Missouri coverage will no longer
            include routine circumcisions.</b></p>

            <p><i>By STEVIE ST. JOHN, Missourian staff</i><br />
             July 25, 2002</p>
            <hr color="brown" size="1" />

            <p>Beginning next month, <a
            href="http://www.medicaid.state.mo.us/"
            target="_blank">Missouri Medicaid</a> will no longer
            pay for male infant circumcisions. The decision to no
            longer fund the procedure will save state coffers about
            $260,000 a year.</p>

            <p>Missouri Medicaid officials were looking for ways to
            reduce costs and considered professional
            recommendations regarding routine circumcision, said
            Greg Vadner, director of the <a
            href="http://www.dss.state.mo.us/dms/"
            target="_blank">Missouri Division of Medical
            Services</a>.</p>

            <p>Beginning Thursday, Missouri Medicaid will no longer
            cover routine male infant circumcisions, he said.
            Circumcisions that are medically necessary, such as in
            case of infection, will still be covered. By not
            covering routine circumcisions, in which the foreskin
            is removed from the penis, Missouri Medicaid expects to
            save $262,103 a year, he said.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;We think this is a change that is reasonable
            . . . that follows established medical
            guidelines,&rdquo; Vadner said.</p>

            <p>Missouri Medicaid listened to input from <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/">Doctors
            Opposing Circumcision</a>, the <a
            href="http://www.aap.org/" target="_blank">American
            Academy of Pediatrics</a> and individual doctors before
            making the decision, he said.</p>

            <p>Vickie Greenlaw, reimbursement assistant for the
            division of urology at <a
            href="http://www.muhealth.org/" target="_blank">MU
            Health Care</a>, said there is a $210 doctor&rsquo;s
            fee and a small instrument use fee for each
            circumcision procedure.</p>

            <p>Dr. Lynn Teague, a pediatric urologist with MU
            Health Care, performs one or two circumcisions per
            week. However, he said, the circumcisions he performs
            are mostly procedures that are necessary because of
            congenital problems. Teague said he does not believe
            routine circumcisions are medically necessary and
            counsels parents against it.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I think (Missouri) Medicaid did the right
            thing,&rdquo; he said.</p>

            <p>Circumcision was thought to be a treatment for
            ailments including epilepsy and alcoholism around 1900,
            he said, and became the norm. He said babies are
            circumcised &ldquo;to look like dad.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a cultural thing rather
            than a medical thing,&rdquo; he said.</p>

            <p>Circumcision does decrease the risk of infections
            for the first few months of life, he said, but does not
            seem to make much difference later. He said that
            studies suggest an uncircumcised man who practiced
            proper hygiene would not be at an increased risk for
            penile cancer.</p>

            <p>Dr. George Denniston, president of the Seattle,
            Wash.-based international organization <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/">Doctors
            Opposing Circumcision</a>, said circumcision is
            harmful. Foreskin protects glands, covers the shaft of
            the penis when it is erect and has nerve endings
            related to sexual pleasure, he said in a phone
            interview from the Seattle Doctors Opposing
            Circumcision office.</p>

            <p>Dr. Jack Swanson, a pediatrician in Ames, Iowa,
            served on the American Academy of Pediatrics task force
            on circumcision in 1999, when the academy&rsquo;s <a
            href="/library/statements/aap1999/">statement on
            circumcision</a> was last revised. In a phone
            interview, he said uncircumcised men have a slightly
            increased risk of infection in the first year of life
            and a slightly increased lifetime risk for penile
            cancer.</p>

            <p>But he said these occurrences are not frequent
            enough to justify every male being circumcised as a
            preventative medical measure.</p>

            <p>He said that he tells his patients it is OK to have
            their baby circumcised but that they should understand
            that they do not need to.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be a personal choice about
            what the parents think is right,&rdquo; he said.</p>
