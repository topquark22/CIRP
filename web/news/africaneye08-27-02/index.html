            <h2>'Spy' cut up about initiations</h2>

            <p>Bushbuckridge - A Limpopo man who broke a cultural
            taboo by "spying" on an initiation has allegedly been
            circumcised as punishment, according to Inspector
            Bonginkosi Msimango.</p>

            <p>Foster Makukule (37) of Gottenburg village near
            Bushbuckridge claims seven initiates kidnapped him and
            he was forced to undergo the initiation ceremony after
            he had been caught trying to peer into the school a day
            before.</p>

            <p>The headmaster of the initiation school and seven
            initiates were not asked to plead on charges of assault
            with intent to do grievous bodily harm when they
            appeared before the Mhala magistrate's court on
            Monday.</p>

            <p>Headmaster Richard Thengwayo (55) was granted R600
            bail and the initiates R300 bail each pending their
            next appearance on September 27.</p>

            <p>Makukule was allegedly chased from the initiation
            school on August 11 and was abducted from his home and
            taken to the initiation school on August 12.</p>

            <p>Family members reported the alleged abduction to
            police on August 13, but police raided the school to
            rescue Makukule only on Friday.</p>

            <p>It is reportedly a traditional norm that if a man is
            caught near an initiation school he is considered to be
            an applicant and is incorporated into the ceremony.</p>

            <p>The accused initiates are: Happiness Mnisi (21),
            Johan Ngobeni (18), Patrick (22), Irvin Hlathini Mnisi
            (18), Louis Thengwayo (37) and two 15-year-old youths.
