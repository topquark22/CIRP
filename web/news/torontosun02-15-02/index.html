      <h2>Parents charged after girl circumcised</h2>

      <p>By JONATHAN KINGSTONE-- Toronto Sun</p>

      <p>TORONTO -- The parents of a St. Catharines girl who was
      forced to undergo female circumcision appear in court today
      charged with arranging the disfiguring surgery.</p>

      <p>The girl, now aged 13, went to police recently about the
      operation, which was performed on her in the family's home
      two years ago. Her mother and father were arrested yesterday
      and charged with aggravated assault. The father faces an
      additional charge of assault with a weapon in a separate
      incident in which police said he beat the girl with a
      belt.</p>

      <p>Police are searching for the "practitioner" who performed
      the controversial mutilation.</p>

      <p>The man or woman is not believed to be a doctor, but
      little else is known since the person's identity is being
      protected by the parents, Niagara Police Det.-Const. Dave
      Weeks said.</p>

      <p>Niagara's family and children's services has been called
      in but officials will not comment on whether the child has
      been removed from family custody.</p>

      <p><span>AGAINST CRIMINAL CODE</span></p>

      <p>Police refused to divulge the race or religion of the
      parents. Historically, the surgery has been performed mainly
      by certain Muslims based on the belief it is required by
      Islam.</p>

      <p>Female genital mutilation has been practiced for 4,000
      years in almost 30 African and Middle Eastern nations and in
      parts of Asia. The surgery, typically performed on girls
      before puberty, ranges from cutting the tip of the clitoris
      to removing all external genitals.</p>

      <p>In Canada, female genital surgery is prohibited by the <a
      href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/index.html">criminal
      code</a> except where "the procedure is medically necessary
      and performed by a doctor or where the subject is 18 years of
      age and consents to the procedure and no bodily harm
      results."</p>

      <p>The parents, whose names are being withheld to protect
      their daughter's identity, are expected to appear in St.
      Catharines court for a bail hearing this morning.</p>
