            24/06/2005 17:34 - (SA) 

            <p>Cape Town - After a fifth death in this year's
            circumcision season, "negligent" parents have been
            criticised by the Eastern Cape health department.</p>

            <p>"They can't just leave their children in the hands
            of traditional nurses. There should be constant
            monitoring on the part of parents," said provincial
            health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">The fifth dead initiate was a
            15-year-old boy from Nelson Mandela Park outside
            Umtata.</span></p>

            <p>It was suspected the boy had died from pneumonia and
            dehydration. A post-mortem will be done.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said the boy was discovered on Thursday night
            in a "bhoma", the specially built grass structure
            candidates live in during their three-month stay at
            initiation schools in the bush.</p>
