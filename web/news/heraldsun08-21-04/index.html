            <h2>Mum tortured son's 13-year-old mate</h2>

            <p>By Christine Caulfield<br />
             August 21, 2004</p>

            <p>A MOTHER of three kidnapped and tortured her son's
            13-year-old schoolmate after wrongly accusing him of
            having designs on her daughter, a court heard
            yesterday.</p>

            <p>Leah Leishman, 38, lured the boy from school and
            drove him to her Crib Point house where she
            systematically interrogated, bashed and humiliated the
            terrified child.</p>

            <p>The County Court was told Leishman beat the boy with
            a baseball bat, punched him in the face repeatedly
            <span class="yellow">and threatened to circumcise him
            with a razor during the two-hour ordeal on June 16 last
            year.</span></p>

            <p>She also set her dog on him, wrote the word liar on
            his head with a Texta and threatened to burn him with a
            cigarette lighter.</p>

            <p>Prosecutor Michael Tinney said Leishman had "got it
            into her head" that her son's good friend, who often
            stayed the night in the family's home, wanted to rape
            her 11-year-old daughter.</p>

            <p>But the boy had no such intention and was now
            emotionally damaged for life, he said.</p>

            <p>"Because she was afraid of harm to her 11-year-old,
            she's forever harmed an innocent 13-year-old," he
            said.</p>

            <p>The court heard Leishman recruited her former foster
            daughter's boyfriend, Jason Sheales, 22, to help her.
            She then drove to the boy's school and tricked him into
            getting in her car. After repeated beatings and threats
            the boy was bound and gagged, and locked in a shed.</p>

            <p>Sheales was sentenced earlier this month to six
            months jail, suspended for two years, after pleading
            guilty to his role in the abduction and assault.</p>

            <p>Leishman's husband, who came home hours later, freed
            the boy and drove him to Frankston railway station to
            catch a train home.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Leishman pleaded guilty to
            child stealing, false imprisonment, intentionally
            causing injury, threatening to inflict serious injury
            and an indecent act with a child under 16.</span></p>

            <p>She was released on bail for sentencing by Judge
            Ross Howie later this month.</p>
