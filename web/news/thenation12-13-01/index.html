      <h2>Moi Bans Circumcision of Girls</h2>

      <p><b>Owino Opondo And Pps</b></p>

      <p>President Moi yesterday banned the circumcision of girls
      aged under 18.</p>

      <p>The directive is in tandem with the Children's Bill, which
      was passed recently by Parliament and now awaits his
      assent.</p>

      <p>The Bill provides for a minimum of a year's jail term
      and/or a fine of Sh50,000 for anyone who circumcises girls or
      forces them into early marriage.</p>

      <p>The President was speaking during the 38th Jamhuri Day
      celebrations at Nyayo National Stadium, Nairobi.</p>

      <p>He warned: "You can look at a 17-year-old girl ... but
      don't touch. If you do, you will be thrown into jail."</p>

      <p>The President also defended Kanu's nomination of only one
      woman to the East African Legislative Assembly.</p>

      <p>The treaty that established the regional community did not
      state how many women Kenya should send to the Assembly, he
      said.</p>

      <p>His off-the-cuff remark was in apparent reference to the
      protests that followed Kanu's decision to nominate one
      instead of two women to the Arusha-based Assembly.</p>

      <p>Kanu nominated Prof Margaret Kamar, principal of Moi
      University's Chepkoilel Campus and also one of Trade Minister
      Nicholas Biwott's wives, to its five-member slot. The
      Democratic Party had earlier picked Mrs Rose Waruhiu.</p>

      <p>Several women's organisations protested Kanu's move,
      saying it amounted to disregard of affirmative action for
      women.</p>

      <p>On Tuesday, hundreds of women demonstrated in Nairobi to
      register their anger at Kanu's refusal to nominate a second
      woman to raise Kenyan women's representation in the Arusha
      Assembly to three - one-third of the allocation of nine
      MPs.</p>

      <p>Yesterday, President Moi reiterated that he did not
      support affirmative action "since women in this country are
      as qualified as men". The principle was entrenched in Kenyan
      politics by the Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group minimum
      reforms of 1997 and is also applied in public university
      intake.</p>

      <p>The Assembly rules did not specify the number of women to
      be nominated by the Nairobi administration, the President
      said.</p>

      <p>"IIisema 'gender' tu, lakini haikusema ni wangapi" (It
      only said gender and not the number), the Head of State
      explained.</p>

      <p>The President said he expected vocal women leaders in the
      country to be in the forefront in the fight for the rights of
      girls - including the right to education and to make informed
      decisions on their lives.</p>
