      <p>NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - In some of the first efforts
      to study the effect of male circumcision on sexual function,
      two new papers present opposite findings, providing evidence
      to support both sides of the debate surrounding the
      procedure.</p>

      <p class="text">In one <a
      href="/library/sex_function/fink1/">study</a>, <a
      href="http://www.unc.edu/" target="_blank">University of
      North Carolina</a> researchers led by Dr. Kenneth Fink showed
      that adult men who underwent circumcision reported a decrease
      in both erectile functioning and penile sensitivity after the
      procedure.</p>

      <p class="text">In the other study, based on results from a
      much smaller group of patients, Dr. Sean Collins of Louisiana
      State University and his team found that newly circumcised
      adult men reported no difference in sexual functioning after
      the procedure.</p>

      <p class="text">Fink and his team also noted that, despite
      reporting a decrease in their sexual pleasure, 62% of men
      said they were satisfied with the results of the procedure.
      In both studies, most of the men underwent the procedure for
      the treatment of a medical condition, such as phimosis, a
      condition in which the foreskin cannot be pulled back over
      the head of the penis.</p>

      <p class="text">Around 77% of American-born men in the US are
      circumcised, although that number appears to be declining
      rapidly in some regions of the country. In one Washington
      state <a
      href="http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/abstract/105/1/S2/246"
       target="_blank">study</a>, only 37% of baby boys born
      between 1987 and 1996 were circumcised in the hospital.</p>

      <p class="text">In recent years, a debate has risen over the
      merits of the procedure, with one side citing the decreased
      rate of infections and sexually transmitted diseases among
      circumcised men, and the other stressing the pain and stress
      inflicted on a baby during circumcision, as well as the
      complications that can arise from the procedure.</p>

      <p class="text">The current <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">policy</a> of the
      American Academy of Pediatrics is that the potential medical
      benefits of male circumcision are not substantial enough to
      recommend that all boys become circumcised.</p>

      <p class="text">Despite anecdotal evidence that circumcised
      penises are less sensitive than uncircumcised penises, no
      studies have examined the effect of adult male circumcision
      on sexual functioning and pleasure--that is, until the
      appearance of these two studies, both published in the May
      issue of the Journal of Urology.</p>

      <p class="text">In the <a
      href="/library/sex_function/fink1/">study</a> conducted by
      Fink and his team, the authors asked 123 men who were already
      circumcised as adults to compare their sexual functioning and
      pleasure from before and after the procedure. The study by
      Collins and his colleagues was based on surveys of 15 men
      conducted both before and 12 weeks after the procedure.</p>

      <p class="text">Commenting on the Collins study to Reuters
      Health, Fink explained that talking to patients both before
      and after the procedure is a better way to measure changes,
      but that 15 patients is simply too small a group to detect
      anything other than large differences.</p>

      <p class="text">Fink added that both studies are flawed in
      that they examine sexual functioning changes in adults
      undergoing circumcision who, in most cases, opt for the
      procedure to correct medical problems. Consequently, Fink
      explained that a man's report of his sexual enjoyment and
      functioning could be influenced by the medical condition that
      prompted circumcision.</p>

      <p class="text">Based on this reasoning, Fink said, one would
      expect study participants to report an increase in sexual
      functioning after the procedure, which could be attributed to
      an improvement in the medical condition. However, a decrease
      in sexual functioning, as reported in Fink's study, shows
      there is likely some other factor influencing the change, he
      said.</p>

      <p class="text">As an explanation for why the men in his
      study reported high satisfaction despite a decrease in sexual
      functioning, Fink said that some were happy to have lower
      sensitivity, which enabled them to postpone orgasm, and
      better please their partners.</p>

      <p class="text">Fink noted that a man's report of sexual
      satisfaction depends on a number of factors.</p>

      <p class="text">"It means different things to different men,"
      he said. "Overall, it looked like it was worth it to them to
      have the procedure."</p>

      <p class="text">Fink stressed that studies of circumcised
      adults cannot be directly applied to newborns, but that
      parents may wish to consider these findings when deciding
      whether to circumcise their children.</p>
