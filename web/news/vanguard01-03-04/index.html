            <p><small><i>Saturday, January 03, 2004</i></small></p>

            <p>YOLA - A dog has eaten up the genitals of a
            one-year-old baby boy who is recovering from
            circumcision in Guyuk Local Government Area of
            Adamawa.</p>

            <p>Narrating the incident which took place this week,
            the baby's father, Mr Amos Mamman, said he had got the
            dog from a distant village and brought it home.</p>

            <p>After he had gone to the farm, his wife laid her
            newly circumcised baby in the room and engaged herself
            with routine domestic chores until she heard the baby's
            unusual cry.</p>

            <p>As she dashed to the room, she found the small dog
            feasting on the baby's penis, while one of his testes
            had already gone, the man said.</p>

            <p>"The baby was naked on medical advice as he was
            newly circumcised and could not wear a nappy,"the
            father explained.</p>

            <p>He said the dog might have been attracted by the
            oily medicine applied to the penis and mistook the
            genitals for prepared meat.</p>

            <p>The boy, who lost his manhood and has since been
            admitted at the Federal Medical Centre in Yola,is now
            responding to treatment.</p>

            <p>The father appealed to the government and wealthy
            individuals to help save the life of his son who, he
            said, needed further medical attention "as he is having
            difficulty in urinating".</p>

            <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the
            Nunguda people in Guyuk are well known for their
            passion for dogs.</p>
