      <h2>CIRCUMCISION REVERSAL GAINS IN POPULARITY</h2>

      <p><b>By Greg Toppo</b></p>

      <p>It may have taken him a year but Paul Russo got his
      foreskin back.</p>

      <p>The 31-year-old technical support representative for a
      Boulder, Colo. software company has been working since
      November 1995 to restore the flap of skin removed when he was
      circumcised as a newborn.</p>

      <p>And he's got pictures to prove it. Just check out his site
      on the World Wide Web. Russo is one of a small but growing
      number of circumcised men, both in the United States and
      abroad, who have elected to restore their foreskins - at home
      and for the most part, without the help of a doctor.</p>

      <p>"I'm far from over, but I'm very happy with it," said
      Russo, who anticipates spending another year to 1 1/2 years
      to complete the process.</p>

      <p>The improbable - some would say unspeakable - procedure is
      virtually unheard of outside medical circles, but it has its
      advocates. And while nobody can say for sure how many men are
      currently "restoring" the numbers of men looking for
      information, both in print and on the Internet, is growing,
      Russo said.</p>

      <p>Most men give two reasons for their decision. The first is
      that they are trying to regain - often with a fair degree of
      anger - something taken from them without their consent.</p>

      <p>"It's my body and I should have a say in it," Russo said.
      "They didn't bother to ask me and they didn't bother to use
      an anesthetic."</p>

      <p>The second reason men give is their restoration of the
      skin over the head of the penis restores a large amount of
      sensation, making for greater sexual pleasure.</p>

      <p>According to Marilyn Milos, a San Anselmo, Calif.
      registered nurse who runs <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/"
      target="_blank">NOCIRC</a>, the National Organization of
      Circumcision Information Resource Centers, men who restore
      say the increased sensation is comparable to "the difference
      between seeing in black and white and seeing in color."</p>

      <p>The restoration process is time-consuming and generally
      takes anywhere from a year to five years of nearly continuous
      attention and care. In most men the entire process takes from
      one to two years. There are number of methods used including
      the following.</p>

      <blockquote>
        Taping the existing shaft skin with surgical tape and
        stretching it as far as possible over the head of the
        penis. This tape is worn virtually all day and night and is
        seldom removed. 

        <p>Wrapping a ring of tape snugly around the bunched skin
        of the shaft, stretching it farther.</p>

        <p>Using a weight or tension device that pulls the skin
        even farther.</p>

        <p>Another method uses a length of tape connected to a
        suspender clipped onto a sock, around a belt or over a
        shoulder. Most device sell for around $100.00, and can be
        mail-ordered.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>All of the men interviewed for this story said the single
      hazard in "restoration" lies in pulling the skin too
      forecfully or with too much weight.</p>

      <p>"If you are doing something that's painful you're doing it
      wrong," said R. Wayne Griffiths, 63, a retired engineer
      construction inspector in Concord, Calif. Griffiths began
      restoring in 1987.</p>

      <p>"If you're doing the restoration properly then you're
      aware of your body and you're not going to do damage to it. -
      it works just fine," Griffiths said.</p>

      <p>In 1989, Griffith, a father of five with 13 grandchildren,
      co-founded NORM, the National Organization of Restoring Men,
      a support group that helps men get information about
      restoration.</p>

      <p>Griffiths, who began restoring his foreskin after becoming
      dissatisfied with his diminishing sensation, said he saw
      results in just a few weeks.</p>

      <p>"At that point, I said, `I'm never going to stop
      restoring,' because the pleasure was just too wonderful for
      me."</p>

      <p>Griffiths said the glans is now "delightfully sensitive to
      the touch." He added, "The glans is an internal organ just
      like the tongue. Circumcision denudes the glans."</p>

      <p>Griffiths, who spent 10 years restoring is satisfied with
      the results. "I've fooled doctors he said with a laugh.</p>

      <p>Milos, like others in the so-called "restoration
      movement," said the urge to bring back one's foreskin
      shouldn't be scoffed at.</p>

      <p>"If a woman has a mastectomy, no one thinks it's odd or
      peculiar that she would want to have a prothesis. But if men
      want to restore their bodies to the way that they were born,
      people find it peculiar. It's not peculiar," she said.</p>

      <p>Milos pointed out that skin stretching techniques are used
      regularly in other areas of medicine besides breast
      reconstruction, such as skin restoration in burn victims.</p>

      <p>Dr. Dean Edell, a San Francisco-based general surgeon and
      host of a popular radio show on medical issues agreed.</p>

      <p>"It can work. You definitely stretch skin voluntarily all
      over the body. We do it in medicine all the time," he said.
      "Its not so strange for men to want to restore something that
      was removed against their will. Frankly, I think body
      piercing is weirder.</p>

      <p>He added, if this was women, everyone on every street
      corner would know about it."</p>

      <p>Edell, who has hosted his show and syndicated television
      new health feature for 17 years, said he's "flooded with
      mail" every time he mentions foreskin restoration.</p>

      <p>He admitted that the procedure, which is not endorsed by
      the American Urological Association, suffers because of a
      lack of scientific studies.</p>

      <p>"It is not ideal, with no controls, no real studies - and
      yet, you know if you're doing it wrong you're going to get
      pain, you're going to get bleeding. So in a sense it's self
      regulating."</p>

      <p>E. Douglas Whitehead, a New York urologist and the
      director of the <a
      href="http://www.drwhitehead.com/phallo_cons.html"
      target="_blank">Association for Male Sexual Dysfunction</a>,
      said there's "tremendous resistance" to the practice from his
      colleagues.</p>

      <p>"I don't think you'd find one urologist out of 100 that
      would begin to get involved in this," he said, adding that he
      supports men who take up restoring their foreskins, even if
      most doctors blanche at the idea.</p>

      <p>"They don't understand the anguish," Whitehead said.
      "You're not doing this for a medical reason per se, you're
      doing this for an emotional and psychological reason."</p>

      <p>Babies have been circumcised as part of religious rituals
      for thousands of years; including those of the ancient Jews
      and Egyptians. Circumcision also is practiced by Muslims,
      usually anytime from a boy's birth through age 14. It also
      serves as an adolescent rite of passage in various cultures.
      The traditional Jewish bris or religious circumcision, takes
      place on the eight day of a boy's life.</p>

      <p>In the United States, medical circumcision became popular
      around 100 years ago. Studies showing that the procedure
      prevents penile cancer, some sexually transmitted diseases
      and cervical cancer in the female partners of men have made
      circumcision almost universal in the United States and many
      other western countries in the past half-century.</p>

      <p>Recently, however the practice has come under serious
      scrutiny. Some studies maintain that the medical benefits of
      circumcision are not as apparent as previously thought.</p>

      <p>An October 1995 study of babies born in 1990 and 1991,
      which was published in the Journal of Family Practice, found
      that 85 percent of male babies in four states studied had
      been circumcised at the time of their birth, and that parents
      who were covered by heath insurance were 2.5 times more
      likely to allow the procedure than uninsured parents.</p>

      <p>The study continued, "Although circumcision is the most
      commonly performed surgical procedure in the United States,
      there is no clear evidence for routinely performing it on
      newborn male infants."</p>

      <p>As of 1994, the circumcision rate was at 60% nationwide
      down from 85% in the 1980s.</p>

      <p>In England, circumcision rates dropped from about 85
      percent to near zero in the 1950s, after the National Health
      Service stopped covering the procedure.</p>

      <p>The textbook of the foreskin restoration movement is The
      Joy of Uncircumcising! a 200-page how to guide first
      published in 1992, authored by Jim Bigelow, a former
      evangelical minister, who like Milos, lives in San Anselmo,
      Calif.</p>

      <p>Bigelow pointed out that men have restored their foreskins
      for a number of more serious reasons than the merely cosmetic
      or sensual, including painful erections and tearing or
      bleeding during intercourse. For his part, Bigelow recommends
      that men work with their doctors while restoring - if they
      can get the doctor to support their decision.</p>

      <p>Tim Hammond, another restoration movement leader and
      founder of the San Francisco-based NO HARM, the National
      Organization to Halt the Abuse and Routine Mutilation of
      Males, said the group has collected about 500 "harm
      documentation forms" of men who have written describing the
      injuries that they've suffered as a result of being
      circumcised. He said those injuries include meningitis,
      infections and hemorrhages as well as the more common loss of
      sensation.</p>

      <p>People have said, `Get a life,' but my response is, `Get a
      clue.' There are some very serious consequences to this.
      Losing the most erogenous part of your genitals is a serious
      issue," he said.</p>

      <p>It's difficult to say how many men have restored their
      foreskins or are currently undergoing the procedure, but
      Bigelow's book has gone through two editions and sold nearly
      10,000 copies. NORM has a mailing list of more than 3,000 men
      and operates about a dozen groups in the United States, with
      another dozen world wide.</p>

      <p>Russo recently said he's getting 200 "hits" or people
      logging on to his Web site every day. As of last week, more
      than 11,000 people had found Russo's site in the past six
      months.</p>

      <p>I'm getting a lot of really good, positive response," he
      said of his "restoration journal," a year-long illustrated
      account of his efforts to bring his foreskin back. "The
      phones ringing off the hook its crazy."</p>

      <p>And the slow process of restoration may soon be a thing of
      the past.</p>

      <p>Whitehead, the New York urologist, is developing a tissue
      expander for foreskin restoration that could cut the time
      required for the procedure down to a matter of months.</p>

      <p>Placed under the skin, the device - essentially a balloon
      similar to those use for breast augmentation - could produce
      enough skin for complete foreskin recovery within three to
      six months. Whitehead expects to begin testing the device
      next month.</p>

      restoration, call Marilyn Milos at NOCIRC: (415) 488-9883 or
