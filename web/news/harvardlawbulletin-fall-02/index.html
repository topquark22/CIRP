            <h2>THE UNKINDEST CUT</h2>

            <p>CIRCUMCISION IS NOT something most people think
            about. If they did, they'd learn that it can cause
            deformity and death and is as unnecessary and
            lamentable as amputating a healthy finger, says
            <b>Steven Svoboda '91.</b> because circumcision is tied
            to the seldom-discussed subject of male sexuality and
            health, he says, the practice continues by many who
            never consider it's consequences.</p>

            <p>Founder and director of <a
            href="http://www.arclaw.org/" target="_blank">Attorneys
            for the Rights of the Child</a>, Svoboda educates and
            litigates on behalf of the burgeoning anticircumcision
            cause. His organization, launched five years ago in
            Berkeley, Calif., is the only legal practice devoted to
            this issue, according to Svoboda. Doing this work
            enables him to practice public interest law in an
            underserved area, he says.</p>

            <p>"I see a lot of harm from this procedure. I don't
            see a lot of lawyers working on it," Svoboda said. "I'm
            here because nobody else is and I think it is an
            important issue."</p>

            <p>While the organization also works to prevent female
            genital cutting, it focuses on male circumcision
            because of it's prevalence in the United States.
            Through educational campaigns directed at the general
            public and the legal bar, Svoboda contends that
            circumcision takes away the protection of the foreskin
            and reduces erogenous function. In addition, according
            to Svoboda, more than 200 boys die each year from the
            procedure, and many others lose their penis or
            substantial portions of it. The organization refers
            potential plaintiffs harmed by circumcision to
            attorneys familiar with the issue and serves as an
            ongoing resource in lawsuits.</p>

            <p>Even for those not obviously damaged by
            circumcision, the procedure is simply never necessary
            and is not endorsed by any national medical
            association, says Svoboda. A surgical procedure should
            not be performed, he says, unless there is a proven
            need. "It's been twisted around to the point that we do
            [circumcision] unless you can prove otherwise, and I
            think that is a cultural thing. It's not based on
            medical reality, " he said. "There is no other
            culturally based procedure that physicians are
            performing."</p>

            <p>The pressure to have a boy circumcised remains
            strong in this country, he says. The notion that a boy
            must "look like his father" is ingrained in many
            people, who are often confused by conflicting
            information available on the practice, says Svoboda.
            Yet the number of circumcisions performed in the United
            States has diminished, from a peak of 85 percent
            decades ago to below 60 percent today, according to
            Svoboda.</p>

            <p>The decreasing popularity of the procedure coincided
            with the rise of the anticircumcision movement in the
            '70's when the American Academy of Pediatrics announced
            that there is no need for circumcision and Dr. Benjamin
            Spock spoke out <a
            href="http://faculty.washington.edu/gcd/DOC/spock.html">
            against it</a>. The cause's first major organization,
            the <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/">National
            Organization of Circumcision Information Resource
            Center</a>, was founded in 1986 and this year presented
            Svoboda with a human rights award. And a passion for
            human rights is why he does this work, he says. He
            won't talk about whether he's circumcised; he says it's
            irrelevant. The movement includes Muslims and Jews (who
            each traditionally circumcise their boys), Christians
            and atheists, women and circumcised and uncircumcised
            men, linked only by their desire to stop this
            practice.</p>

            <p>While ideally circumcision should be outlawed,
            Svoboda says, the more pragmatic path is to show people
            that circumcision should no longer be a part of the
            culture, so that it would become as antiquated as, say,
            foot binding now is in China. That will eventually
            happen, he believes.</p>

            <p>"Every culture develops a rationale for why this
            particular practice makes sense and vilifies the other
            practices," said Svoboda. "I think we're in a process
            of inlearning those things. I believe it takes awhile.
            It's a long road, but I think we're going down that
            road."<br />
