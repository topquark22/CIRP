            <p>Dusseldorf - A 77-year-old Turkish national who
            performed ritual circumcisions on seven boys was
            convicted Tuesday in Germany of causing dangerous
            bodily harm and fined &euro;2 100 (about R20 000).</p>

            <p>Prosecutors told the state court in Dusseldorf that
            circumcision was only allowed in Germany for medical
            reasons and could only be performed by surgeons.
            Traditional Turkish Muslims practise circumcision on
            boys aged 6 to 11 as a manhood initiation ritual.</p>

            <p>The accused did not attend the trial, a re-hearing
            in an appeal court, two years after he had been fined
            the same amount.</p>

            <p>At the original trial, the accused agreed he had
            performed the circumcisions at the request of parents
            in several cities. Police who seized the surgical
            instruments at his home described them as dirty and
            university scientists said he did not follow hygiene
            rules. - Sapa-dpa</p>
