            <h2>Passage to manhood</h2>

            <p>By Rommel G. Rebollido</p>

            <p>WITH eyes focused, an old man positions a "pinute"
            (knife) under my stretched foreskin while extending his
            other hand holding a wooden club.</p>

            <p>In a blink of an eye, the man delivers a quick
            blow.</p>

            <p>"Whack" goes the club as it hit the back of the
            blade and fresh blood dripped from between the legs of
            a boy as peers waited for their turn, anxiety painted
            on their face.</p>

            <p>The boy, smiling yet visibly shaken, quickly jumped
            into a nearby stream.</p>

            <p>That scene was in a rustic town in Cotabato City
            some 38 or so summers ago when I got my "rite of
            passage" to manhood.</p>

            <p>Summer is again here and similar scenes will once
            more take the rural areas in this country where "tule"
            or male circumcision is widely practiced.</p>

            <p>Interestingly, it is usually during these hot summer
            days when school is off that boys gather near a river
            or a stream to take on the tradition of entering
            manhood.</p>

            <p>A "manunule" (experienced circumciser) normally
            performs the manhood rite using an extremely sharp
            knife or a labaja (barber's knife) and a "pukpok"
            (club).</p>

            <p>A boy being circumcised is asked to chew guava
            leaves which extract he will spit on the cut as a means
            of medication.</p>

            <p>Going through the entire process means mainstreaming
            into the vast majority of circumcised Filipinos and
            escape from that potential social stigma of being
            tagged "pisot" or "supot" (uncircumcised).</p>

            <p>"Patuli gyud aron dili surahon (Get circumcised so
            you won't get mocked)," said office worker Jaime
            Lim.</p>

            <p>The practice of circumcision seemingly started
            during the stone age as suggested by tools and
            artifacts that were recovered in Egypt.</p>

            <p>In the Philippines, where it has been a tradition
            for over a century now, there is nothing definite as to
            how and when it really began.</p>

            <p>But, common belief has it that the practice was
            introduced by western colonizers.</p>

            <p>There have been talks that colonizers used
            circumcision to identify groups supportive to them,
            even as history books appear to have failed mentioning
            it.</p>

            <p>In the United States, circumcision began during the
            masturbation hysteria of the Victorian Period, as a
            punishment to boys caught masturbating.</p>

            <p>That practice of penile mutilation continued even
            after the masturbation craze as most US hospitals have
            institutionalized compulsory circumcision to
            newborns.</p>

            <p>In recent years, however, there has been an ongoing
            debate on whether circumcision should be practiced or
            not.</p>

            <p>Some in the medical field claimed that male
            circumcision is necessary for hygiene and disease
            prevention.</p>

            <p>American medical reports said the procedure is said
            to prevent such ailments as epilepsy, convulsions,
            paralysis, elephantiasis, tuberculosis, eczema,
            bed-wetting, wet dreams, hip-joint disease, fecal
            incontinence, rectal prolapse, hernia, head-aches,
            nervousness, hysteria, poor eyesight, idiocy, mental
            retardation and even insanity.</p>

            <p>Studies comparing HIV-infected men in Africa show a
            high prevalence among the uncircumcised.</p>

            <p>According to a study by Dr. Stephen Moses, ethnic
            groups where adult HIV levels were below one per cent
            in sub-Saharan Africa, 97 percent of the males are
            circumcised, and where the levels were above 10 per
            cent, only six per cent of males are circumcised.</p>

            <p>Moses said similar situations have been observed in
            the more than 30 studies carried out among more than 40
            circumcising and non-circumcising communities across
            Africa.</p>

            <p>Sub-Saharan Africa represents 68 per cent of the
            global infection, according to the World Health
            Organization.</p>

            <p>Clinical studies point to increased susceptibility
            of the flesh under the foreskin to inflammation,
            abrasions during intercourse and prolonged viral
            survival due to warmth and moistness under the "sheath"
            of the uncircumcised.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, Dr. Robert S. Van Howe of the
            Department of Pediatrics, Marshfield Clinic, Lakeland
            Center in the United States, said recommending routine
            circumcision as a prophylactic measure to prevent HIV
            infection is scientifically unfounded.</p>

            <p>He said that a <a
            href="/library/disease/HIV/vanhowe4/"
            target="_blank">meta-analysis</a> performed on 29
            published articles showed that a circumcised man is at
            greater risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV than a
            non-circumcised man.</p>

            <p>Other findings blame the infections on the
            accumulation of smegma, a white emollient under the
            foreskin.</p>

            <p>But, in his article "<a
            href="/news/Mothering1997/">The Case Against
            Circumcision</a>," Dr. Paul M. Fleiss, an assistant
            clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of
            Southern California Medical Center, said smegma (tiktik
            in the vernacular) is the most misunderstood, most
            unjustifiably maligned substance in nature.</p>

            <p>"Smegma is clean, not dirty," he said, as it is
            beneficial and necessary for it moisturizes the glans
            (penile head) and keeps it smooth and supple. It has
            antibacterial and antiviral properties that keep the
            penis clean and healthy.</p>

            <p>An American doctor once said the animal kingdom
            would probably cease to exist without smegma.</p>

            <p>Circumcision critics said historical data suggests
            that circumcision was never associated with medical
            benefits.</p>

            <p>It was done for reasons of religion, social control
            and punishment, they said.</p>

            <p>Fleiss said the foreskin is necessary and should not
            be removed. In his article, he discussed the numerous
            functions of the foreskin, which include protective,
            sensory and sexual.</p>

            <p>He said the foreskin protects the glans and keeps
            its surface soft, moist and sensitive. It maintains
            optimal warmth, pH balance and cleanliness.</p>

            <p>Among others, he said the foreskin has erogenous
            sensitivity as it is sensitive as the lips of the mouth
            and fingertips. It has specialized nerve receptors,
            which can discern motion, subtle changes in temperature
            and fine gradations of texture.</p>

            <p>As coverage during erection, Fleiss said when the
            penis becomes erect, the shaft becomes thicker and
            longer. The double-layered foreskin accommodates the
            expanded organ and allows the penile skin to glide
            freely, smoothly and pleasurably over the shaft and
            glans.</p>

            <p>The foreskin has self-stimulating sexual functions
            as its double-layered sheath enables the penile shaft
            skin to glide back and forth over the penile shaft, he
            explained.</p>

            <p>It can normally be slipped all the way or almost all
            the way back to the base of the penis, and also slipped
            forward beyond the glands. This wide range of motion is
            the mechanism that triggers the stimulation of the
            foreskin, frenulum and glans.</p>

            <p>During intercourse, one of the foreskin's functions
            is to stimulate smooth, gentle movement between the
            mucosal surfaces of the two partners during
            intercourse, Fleiss said.</p>

            <p>The foreskin enables the penis to slip in and out of
            the vagina non-abrasively inside its own slick sheath
            of self-lubricating, movable skin. Thus, the female is
            stimulated by moving pressure rather than by friction
            only, as when the male's foreskin is missing.</p>

            <p>Fleiss said the foreskin also fosters intimacy
            between the two sexual partners by enveloping the
            glands and maintaining it as an internal organ. The
            sexual experience is enhanced when the foreskin slips
            back to allow the male's internal organ, the glands, to
            meet the female's internal organ.</p>

            <p>Most of the circumcised males, may have not thought
            of all these as statistics show that over 90 percent of
            circumcision in the Philippines are done because of
            tradition and peer pressure.</p>

            <p>Less than nine percent are done for religious
            reasons and only one percent for medical reasons, said
            Dr. Reynaldo Joson, head of the <a
            href="http://ommcsurgery.tripod.com/surgdisc.htm"
            target="_blank">Ospital ng Maynila Department of
            Surgery</a>, in an <a
            href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Philippin3.html"
            target="_blank">article</a> posted in the Internet.</p>

            <p>Joson is an avid campaigner of "Tule! Masakit, Di
            Kailangan", an advocacy drive against genital
            mutiliation in the Philippines.</p>

            <p>He said there is a need to give complete information
            and counseling to parents prior to and after making a
            decision on whether to have their sons circumcised or
            not.</p>

            <p>In short, people should be aware that on the issue
            of circumcision there are two options--to cut or not to
            cut.</p>

            <p>That, of course is not a decision that solely rest
            on the parents, but would need the consent of their
            son.</p>

            <p>A decision must be made soon as summer is just
            around the bend.</p>

            <p>Do I hear the kids...or is it the wives
            grumbling?</p>
