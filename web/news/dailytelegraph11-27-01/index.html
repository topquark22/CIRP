      <h2>Patient died 'because surgeon guessed dose'</h2>

      <p>By Paul Stokes</p>
      (Filed: 27/11/2001) 

      <p>A SURGEON "guessed" the level of anaesthetic he gave to a
      patient who died after a routine circumcision operation, a
      jury was told yesterday.</p>

      <p>Pravin Chaturbhai Patel, 52, was charged with manslaughter
      after Andrew Ryan received an injection more than three times
      the recommended levels.</p>

      <p>Mr Ryan, 20, a muscular dystrophy sufferer, went to
      Shotley Bridge Hospital, in Consett, Co Durham, for the
      operation on July 25, 1997.</p>

      <p>He weighed about 3st 4lb and had 10 millilitres (200mg) of
      two per cent lignocaine administered as a local anaesthetic.
      This was the maximum adult dose, Newcastle upon Tyne Crown
      Court was told, but the maximum dose in Mr Ryan's case was 3
      millilitres (60mg).</p>

      <p>Jeremy Hill-Baker, prosecuting, said Patel was guilty of
      gross negligence by not ascertaining Mr Ryan's weight to
      calculate the amount of drug.</p>

      <p>He had given Mr Ryan "an overdose of local anaesthetic
      which led to convulsions, respiratory failure and ultimately
      death," said Mr Hill-Baker.</p>

      <p>Patel, of Harrow, north-west London, denies manslaughter.
      The hearing continues.</p>
