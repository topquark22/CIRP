      <h2>Canada Debates Validity of Male Circumcision</h2>
      <b>By Julie Remy</b> 

      <p><b>TORONTO (Reuters) -</b> Canadian anti-circumcision
      crusaders are challenging a law protecting women against
      genital mutilation as a way to draw attention to much more
      common male circumcision.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.courtchallenge.com/"
      target="_blank">court challenge</a> led by Dr. Arif Bhimji
      has sparked a heated debate that pits subscribers to modern
      human rights tenets against followers of age-old religious
      traditions.</p>

      <p>"We are saying that this section is discriminatory because
      it provides protection to females but it does not provide the
      same protection to males," said Bhimji, an emergency-room
      physician and a Muslim who heads the anti-circumcision
      Association for Genital Integrity.</p>

      <p>He argues that the section of the criminal code concerning
      aggravated assault violates the <a
      href="http://canada.justice.gc.ca/loireg/charte/const_en.html"
       target="_blank">Canadian Charter on Rights and Freedoms</a>,
      which guarantees equality between the sexes.</p>

      <p>Male circumcision is common in North America and elsewhere
      for religious and cultural reasons and to help prevent
      urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases and
      penile cancer. In the minor surgical operation, the foreskin
      is removed to prevent bacteria from developing under the fold
      of skin.</p>

      <p>Yet more is at risk than most people think, said John
      Antonopoulos of the Montreal-based <a
      href="http://www.infocirc.org/" target="_blank">Information
      Center on Circumcision</a>. "It is not a small, useless piece
      of skin. There is a whole world of sensations in the
      foreskin," he said, citing <a
      href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">sensitive nerve
      connections</a> at the end of the penis.</p>

      <p>A mandatory practice in Islam and Judaism, circumcision
      was introduced to Anglo-Saxon countries at the turn of the
      19th century and expanded in the 1950s as a way to improve
      hygiene. Experts say it was also seen as a way to control
      sexual urges and reduce masturbation, believed to cause
      mental illness.</p>

      <p>Since the 1970s there has been an ongoing debate over its
      merits and the <a
      href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm"
      target="_blank">Canadian Pediatric Society</a>, like several
      medical associations in the United States, Britain and
      Australia, said in 1996 that newborns should not be routinely
      circumsized.</p>

      <p>"There are potential complications and it's not medically
      necessary," said Dr. Debra Davis, a member of the Canadian
      Pediatric Society. In 2 to 10 percent of circumcisions minor
      complications such as bleeding, infection and inflammation
      can occur and, more rarely, damage to the penis can lead to
      amputation, she said.</p>

      <p>Given those concerns, she said there was a "real push"
      from the medical community in the mid-1980s to decrease the
      rate of circumcision, which fell to 60 percent from almost 90
      percent in the United States and to 20 percent from 50 per
      cent in Canada.</p>

      <p>Davis said no new medical evidence has arisen that would
      justify recommending a return to circumcision.</p>

      <p><b>DIVINE COMMANDMENT OR CRUEL TREATMENT?</b></p>

      <p>Bhimji said medical associations failed to educate
      professionals on this delicate matter. "As a physician, I had
      an obligation to make sure that we are protecting the most
      vulnerable in our society," he said.</p>

      <p>"I am a Muslim, so this is something I didn't take
      lightly, but I came to the conclusion that just because it is
      a religious requirement it doesn't give us an unfettered
      right to cause harm to our children."</p>

      <p>The view of most human rights, children's aid and
      religious groups is that, unlike female genital mutilation
      (FGM), male circumcision is not a deliberate attempt to
      injure the child.</p>

      <p>"Male circumcision does have recognized medical benefits
      ... FGM in contrast was never medically accepted and all
      colleges (of physicians and surgeons) have banned the
      practice," said Carole Morency of <a
      href="http://canada.justice.gc.ca/" target="_blank">Justice
      Canada</a>.</p>

      <p>Male circumcision cannot be compared to female genital
      mutilation -- often mistakenly called female circumcision --
      which generally involves the complete removal of female
      genitalia and poses serious health risks, Morency said.</p>

      <p>"We amended the code in 1997 to avoid any uncertainty that
      the <a
      href="http://canada.justice.gc.ca/en/laws/C-46/index.html"
      target="_blank">criminal law</a> in Canada does clearly
      prohibit the practice of FGM," she said, rejecting Bhimji's
      argument that the section violates the Charter's requirement
      of equality of treatment.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.cjc.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian
      Jewish Congress</a> immediately said it would oppose any
      court challenge to the law.</p>

      <p>"Circumcision is a divine commandment. It's not an
      optional kind of thing and it doesn't depend on logic," CJC
      communications director Rubin Friedman said. If a child is
      not healthy, the only exception would be delaying the rite,
      usually performed on the eighth day following birth, he
      said.</p>

      <p>If the court challenge were accepted, he said, "I think it
      would be a huge issue."</p>
