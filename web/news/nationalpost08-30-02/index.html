            It was not prompted by baby's death, doctor says</h2>

            <p><b>Adrian Humphreys</b><br />
             National Post</p>

            <p>Friday, August 30, 2002</p>

            <p>A review of the practice of infant circumcision by
            the <a href="http://www.cpsbc.bc.ca/"
            target="_blank">College of Physicians and Surgeons of
            British Columbia</a> was not prompted by the surprising
            <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/theprovince08-29-02/">death</a>
            last week of a five-week-old baby shortly after
            undergoing the procedure, the college spokesman
            says.</p>

            <p>The issue was placed on the agenda of the doctors'
            regulatory board weeks ago, prompted by a sternly
            worded letter issued by Saskatchewan's college, warning
            physicians away from performing circumcisions, said Dr.
            Morris VanAndel, registrar of the B.C. college.</p>

            <p>"I guess coincidence would be the term for it," said
            Dr. VanAndel.</p>

            <p>"Added to the mix now is this particular situation.
            Whether it will influence the decision, I have no
            idea."</p>

            <p>A five-week-old boy was released from Penticton
            Regional Hospital after a circumcision on Aug. 20, but
            his parents went back to talk to the doctor later that
            day with concerns about bleeding.</p>

            <p>The situation worsened overnight, forcing them to
            rush the child back to hospital early the next day. The
            infant was flown to <a
            href="http://www.cw.bc.ca/index.asp"
            target="_blank">B.C. Children's Hospital</a> in
            Vancouver. He died two days after the procedure.</p>

            <p>The death is under investigation by the coroner's
            office, said Ian McKichan, regional coroner. The
            college is also investigating the circumstances of the
            case, said Dr. VanAndel.</p>

            <p>An autopsy on the baby was scheduled for yesterday,
            but the findings were not available.</p>

            <p>Rates of circumcision vary across Canada, from a
            high of 27.6% in Saskatchewan to a low of 0.6% in
            Newfoundland, according to the Saskatchewan
            college.</p>

            <p>Dr. VanAndel warned, however, against letting
            emotion over the incident interfere with making a sound
            policy decision.</p>

            <p>"Should all decisions be made on an emotional basis
            because a very tragic and most regrettable complication
            occurred? Every time somebody dies in a car accident,
            should we outlaw driving?" said Dr. VanAndel.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.quadrant.net/cpss/">College
            of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan</a> sent a
            two-page letter to its members in February, titled <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/sask2002/">Caution
            Against Routine Circumcision of Newborn Male Infants</a>.</p>

            <p>The letter says: "It is difficult to identify any
            other domain of medicine in which physicians would feel
            comfortable playing such a passive role in a decision
            pathway culminating in surgery.</p>

            <p>"It is also difficult to identify any other domain of
            medicine in which practice patterns stand in such stark
            contrast to research evidence."</p>

            <p>A spokesman for a <a
            href="http://www.courtchallenge.com/"
            target="_blank">Canadian anti-circumcision lobby
            group</a> said the death may serve as a wake-up call
            for parents who treat the decision to circumcise their
            babies lightly.</p>

            <p>"Infant circumcision is not medically necessary
            except in the rarest of situations. It should be
            remembered that all surgical procedures have risks, no
            matter how trivial they may seem at the time," said
            Arif Bhimji, a Toronto-area emergency room doctor who
            is a spokesman for the Association for Genital
            Integrity.</p>

            <p>A mounting body of medical evidence suggests the
            procedure is largely unnecessary and the practice is in
            decline.</p>

            <p>In 1996, the <a href="http://www.cps.ca/">Canadian
            Pediatric Society</a> published an extensive <a
            href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm"
             target="_blank">report</a> in the Canadian Medical
            Association Journal that concluded, as an official
            stance, that routine circumcision is not
            recommended.</p>
