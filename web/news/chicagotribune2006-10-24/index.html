            <h2>Judge rules against boy&rsquo;s circumcision</h2>

            <p><b>By Judy Peres</b><br />
             Tribune staff reporter<br />
             <i>Published October 24, 2006, 10:48 AM CDT</i></p>

            <p>In a case that has been closely watched by
            anti-circumcision groups nationwide, a Cook County
            judge today ruled that a 9-year-old Northbrook boy
            should not be circumcised against his will.</p>

            <p>The court battle pitted the boy's divorced parents
            against each other, with the mother and her new husband
            claiming that the operation was necessary to prevent
            recurrent irritation and infection. The boy's father
            sought an injunction to bar the circumcision.</p>

            <p>The <i>Tribune</i> is not naming the parents in
            order to protect the boy's privacy.</p>

            <p>In a written opinion handed down today, Circuit
            Judge Jordan Kaplan found that "the evidence was
            conflicting and inconclusive as to any past infections
            or irritations that may have been suffered by the
            child."</p>

            <p>"Moreover," he continued, "this court also finds
            that medical evidence as provided by the testimony of
            the expert witnesses for each of the parties is
            inconclusive as to the medical benefits or non-benefits
            of circumcision as it relates to the 9-year-old
            child."</p>

            <p>The case was a clear victory for the growing number
            of so-called "intactivist groups" across the country
            that have argued that circumcision is harmful and
            violates the rights of children who are not old enough
            to consent to the irreversible medical procedure.</p>

            <p>Kaplan, <span class="yellow">who also cited the
            irreversible nature of the operation, said his order
            would remain in effect until the boy turns 18, when he
            can decide for himself whether or not he wants to be
            circumcised.</span></p>

            <p>The father said he was relieved by the decision and
            "so happy."</p>

            <p>His lawyer, Alan Toback, said, "We always thought it
            was <span class="yellow">not in the child's best
            interest</span> to have a circumcision at age 9 that
            was not medically necessary, and the judge agreed."</p>

            <p>The mother's lawyer, Tracy Rizzo, was not in court
            due to the death of her father, famed Chicago private
            investigator Ernie Rizzo. The mother was represented
            instead by Gail O'Connor, who indicated there would be
            no appeal.</p>

            <p>"We're disappointed of course, but we will abide by
            the injunction," she said.</p>

            <p>The parents divorced in 2003. The mother has custody
            of the boy, but under a parenting agreement reached as
            part of the divorce was obligated to consult her
            ex-husband regarding any non-emergency medical care for
            the child.</p>
