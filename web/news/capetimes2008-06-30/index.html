            June 30 2008 at 09:54AM 

            <p>A 16-year-old boy died on Saturday after being
            circumcised, bringing the initiation death toll to 10
            in the past week, the <a
            href="http://www.ecdoh.gov.za/" target="_blank">Eastern
            Cape department of health</a> said.<br />
            <br />
             "The boy died after he was initiated at a school in
            the village of Gxulu, on the outskirts of Mthatha,"
            said spokesperson Sizwe Kupela.<br />
            <br />
             He said the boy died while on the way to hospital
            during the early hours of Saturday morning.<br />
            <br />
             "When police went to the school to investigate, they
            found that it had been deserted... the community told
            police that all initiates at the school were sent home,
            and that the person who was responsible for the
            circumcisions had disappeared."<br />
            <br />
             The nine others had died in various parts of the
            Eastern Cape since last Monday.<br />
            <br />
             Police were searching for the man and investigating
            the increasing number of deaths, Kupela said. -
