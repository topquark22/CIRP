            <p>Date: April 13 2004</p>

            <p><b>Breeders reckon the new ban on docking puppies'
            tails really takes the biscuit, writes Joel
            Gibson.</b></p>

            <p>When a bulldog named Buldawg Our Man Godfrey - "Bob"
            to his close friends - was crowned Best in Show
            yesterday at the <a
            href="http://www.eastershow.com.au/"
            target="_blank">Royal Easter Show</a>, the applause was
            a little dampened, the ribbon a little less brilliant
            and the victory lap a little shorter than usual.</p>

            <p>For the tight-knit community of people who breed,
            show and handle purebred dogs, Best in Show is often
            the biggest day of the year. But April 1 marked the end
            of a long, sometimes bitter and ultimately futile
            battle with the State Government, animal welfare groups
            and liberationists over the emotive issue of puppies'
            tails. On that day, NSW fell into line with other
            states and banned the removal - or docking - of dogs'
            tails except for therapeutic reasons and unless
            performed by a vet.</p>

            <p>Many breeders are threatening to stop breeding in
            protest at the ban, which could signal the end of
            bloodlines whose pups once fetched as much as a small
            car.</p>

            <p>A rottweiler breeder, Patricia Hall, has dogs,
            bitches and frozen semen worth thousands of dollars
            that she says she will never use for breeding again. As
            president of the 35,000-member <a
            href="http://www.dogbody.com/"
            target="_blank">DogBody</a>, Hall has argued that the
            ban on tail docking is a restraint of trade and an
            impingement on the rights of responsible people to care
            for their own animals, and is likely to lead to poor
            hygiene or injury.</p>
            <img src="smh04-14-04-poodleRHS.jpg" align="right"
            hspace="20" alt="show poodle" /> 

            <p>But Hall and her ilk are victims of a "paradigm
            shift" in ideas about animal welfare, says Dr Mark
            Lawrie, the <a href="http://www.rspca.org.au/"
            target="_blank">RSPCA</a>'s chief veterinarian in NSW.
            "[The ban] comes up against long-held beliefs that
            people are emotively involved with. More and more
            developed societies are doing away with this practice
            and in five or 10 years the breeders will be supportive
            of it," he said.</p>

            <p>What the dog people are asking themselves is, why
            them. There seem to be more pressing issues for
            liberationists. A Freedom of Information request by one
            breeder revealed that the <a
            href="http://www.nsw.gov.au/" target="_blank">NSW
            Government</a>'s consultation process elicited 36
            responses about tail docking. Seven were in favour of a
            ban (four organisations and three individuals), whereas
            28 argued against it (11 organisations and seven
            individuals).</p>

            <p>Perhaps the purpose is symbolic, says <a
            href="http://www.arts.usyd.edu.au/departs/philos/stacademic.html"
            target="_blank">Dr Caroline West</a>, a lecturer in
            applied ethics at the <a href="http://www.usyd.edu.au/"
            target="_blank">University of Sydney</a>. Animal
            liberationists have had many more significant victories
            in the 30-year history of their movement, such as the
            <a
            href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/poctaa1979360/"
            target="_blank">Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
            Act</a> and regulations governing the use of animals in
            experiments, but their efforts have rarely had such a
            visible impact on the everyday lives of ordinary
            people.</p>

            <p>"I have to say that the focus on docking seems
            slightly strange to me, given that other issues - for
            example, factory farming and other meat production
            processes - seem to involve so much more suffering to
            non-human animals than docking. But tail docking was
            probably an easier battle to win, politically speaking,
            since many people already think it's pointless and
            pretty barbaric."</p>

            <p>Applied ethicists in the tradition of the British
            philosopher <a href="http://www.petersingerlinks.com/"
            target="_blank">Peter Singer</a>, says West, would
            probably consider docking a marginal case. Removing
            dogs' tails is unnatural, certainly, but justifiable if
            any suffering is outweighed by other benefits.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">There are interesting
            similarities with human circumcision, she
            says.</span></p>

            <p><span class="yellow">"In both cases, the subjects
            [dogs or typically very young infants] are not in a
            position to offer their own consent to the procedure.
            Both cases may involve some suffering to those
            involved, although there's argument about the extent of
            this in both cases. In both cases, similar
            justifications are given for the practices: health
            benefits for the individual, aesthetic reasons,
            continuity of historical and cultural tradition, etc. I
            think the parallel is interesting: if you think one's
            morally OK, why should the other be
            different?"</span></p>

            <p>In the end, dog breeders might have the cuteness of
            their pets to blame for being targeted. "People are so
            much more motivated to stop mistreatment of animals
            that are cute," she says.</p>

            <p>"If puppies looked like giant insects, I think
            people would be much less moved . . . I don't think
            this prejudice in favour of the cute is really morally
            defensible [but] if it helps to prevent unjustified
            suffering to some non-human animals, that's at least
            something."</p>
