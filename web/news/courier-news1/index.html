      Circumcision of boy, 3, postponed<br />
      By BERNICE PAGLIA<br />
       Staff Writer 

      <p><b>Published in the Courier News on October 12,
      2000</b></p>

      <p>RARITAN BOROUGH -- A father called off a protest of his
      son's scheduled circumcision Wednesday after the doctor
      canceled the surgery.</p>

      <p>Jim Price had vowed to sue a pediatric urologist if he
      carried out surgery today for which his estranged wife,
      Jennifer Price, won a court ruling in August. Judge Paul
      Armstrong ruled in her favor based on two doctors' reports
      that the surgery would correct inflammatory problems suffered
      by the couple's 3-year-old son, Matthew.</p>

      <p>But the matter of whether Matthew will be circumcised is
      not over.</p>

      <p>Mrs. Price's attorney, Ron Heymann, was headed to Judge
      Armstrong's court today to seek a "remedy" against the
      father's legal threats. And instead of marching outside <a
      href="http://www.rwjuh.edu/index2.htm">Robert Wood Johnson
      University Hospital</a> in New Brunswick with supporters
      Wednesday, Mr. Price spent a large portion of the day
      conferring with lawyers over his next legal move.</p>

      <p>"We're willing to go to the Supreme Court," Mr. Price
      said.</p>

      <p>The urologist did not return a call for comment and a
      hospital spokesman also declined comment, citing protection
      of the family.</p>

      <p>At issue is whether the boy needs the surgery to avoid
      recurrent infections. Mr. Price said his son no longer has
      problems which he believes were caused by a doctor's improper
      treatment. But Heymann said two doctors have recommended the
      surgery.</p>

      <p>Mr. Price and two lawyers met Wednesday to plan a strategy
      to stay Judge Armstrong's order.</p>

      <p>The controversy brought him an avalanche of phone calls
      and e-mails from people with personal stories of circumcision
      harm, activists who oppose circumcision and even supporters
      promising to help pay for Price's defense of his stand.</p>

      <p>The outpouring came from all over North America, and Mr.
      Price said the issue was even discussed in Hawaii. He expects
      to tape a television interview today, he said, declining to
      name the station.</p>

      <p>Since his story appeared in the Courier News, Mr. Price
      said, "The phone just rang off the hook."</p>

      <p>He said he did not realize the depth of concern over
      circumcision. Personally, he said, "It's definitely not
      necessary for my son -- I don't want any harm to come to my
      son."</p>

      <p>Circumcision, routinely performed for decades on male
      infants in the United States for health or religious reasons,
      has come into question by some medical professionals as well
      as by people who say male or female circumcision is nothing
      more than genital mutilation. A search on the Internet yields
      lengthy histories of the surgery, religious beliefs for its
      use and sources where opponents organize against it.</p>

      <p>The American Pediatric Association came out in March 1999
      with a <a href="/library/statements/aap1999/">position</a> of
      not recommending routine circumcision, saying parents must
      weigh the benefits and risks and make an informed decision.
      The group's stand was based on research going back 40 years.
      Since <a href="/library/statements/aap/#1971">1971</a>, the
      academy has concluded in its manual for newborn care that
      there is no absolute medical reason for routine
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>The new policy also states that if parents choose
      circumcision, pain relief for the patient is essential.</p>
