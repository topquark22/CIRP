      <h2>Korean Circumcision Rising, in Emulation of West</h2>

      <p>By Merritt McKinney</p>

      <p>NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The mistaken belief that
      circumcision is the norm in most industrialized nations and
      other misconceptions about the procedure may help explain why
      South Korea has a much higher circumcision rate than
      neighboring countries, researchers report.</p>

      <p>South Korea, like other countries with strong Buddhist and
      Confucian traditions, does not have a history of regular
      circumcision, according to Drs. DaiSik Kim and M. G. Pang of
      <a href="http://www.snu.ac.kr/engsnu/">Seoul National
      University</a>. But unlike its Asian neighbors, South Korea
      has had a steadily increasing circumcision rate since the end
      of World War II, Kim and Pang report in the January issue of
      the <i>British Journal of Urology International</i>.</p>

      <p>In 2000, Kim and Pang interviewed more than 5,000 South
      Korean males or their parents about circumcision. They also
      talked with 267 physicians.</p>

      <p>Based on the survey, the researchers calculate that in
      1945 the circumcision rate was less than 0.1% in what is now
      South Korea. The 2000 rate, according to the researchers, is
      roughly 60%.</p>

      <p>As the Asian nation's circumcision rate has risen, the
      average age at circumcision has dropped, according to the
      researchers. For middle-aged men in the survey, the average
      age at circumcision was about 27. But most South Korean boys
      are circumcised when they are about 12 years old, according
      to Kim and Pang.</p>

      <p>Circumcision has become a rite of passage into manhood for
      South Korean boys, Kim told Reuters Health.</p>

      <p>``In the last 20 years, the estimated number of
      circumcisions per year far exceeded the number of male
      births,'' Kim said. He explained that it is not unusual for
      older, uncircumcised male relatives to undergo circumcision
      when a boy gets circumcised.</p>

      <p>Although the circumcision rate rose dramatically during a
      period when the US had a major influence on South Korea, ``no
      American doctors publicly recommended it,'' according to
      Kim.</p>

      <p>What Kim and Pang found in their survey, though, is that
      many South Korean physicians have mistaken beliefs about the
      procedure.</p>

      <p>``In South Korea, circumcision has been equated with
      development and industrialization,'' Kim said. After coming
      in contact with the US Army, South Koreans, including
      doctors, ''wrongly assumed'' that all white males are
      circumcised, he said.</p>

      <p>More than half of the doctors polled believed that
      Scandinavia has a circumcision rate of more than 50%. In
      fact, according to the researchers, the actual rate is 1% to
      2%. In another sign that circumcision may be connected with
      modernization in the minds of South Koreans, the majority of
      doctors also believed, mistakenly, that circumcision is
      routine in Japan.</p>

      <p>In contrast, none of the doctors believed that less
      developed North Korea has a mass circumcision program.</p>

      <p>``It is clear that most South Korean doctors believe in
      the strong correlation between economic prosperity, medical
      advance and circumcision,'' Kim and Pang state in their
      report.</p>

      <p>Many doctors also believed that circumcision can reduce
      the risk of cervical cancer in a man's sexual partner, which
      is ``an outdated notion,'' according to the researchers.</p>
