            <p>OPINION May 17, 2002<br />
             Posted to the web May 17, 2002</p>

            <p>Abdou M. Jeng<br />
            Banjul<br />
            </p>

            <p class="text">For years now, many health-related and
            other international organisations, particularly the
            WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank, USAID, and UNDP have
            been strategizing global campaigns against Female
            Genital Mutilation (FGM), but still the efforts have
            not been able to completely eradicate the practice. But
            why is it so!</p>

            <p class="text">Fellow Gambians and Africans, let's
            reason, without any emotional or cultural sentiments.
            Men are not directly affected during the physical
            operation, but its after effects affect both men and
            women either directly or indirectly, sooner or
            later.</p>

            <p class="text">FGM is always a sensitive topic for
            discussion either in the home or in the media.</p>

            <p class="text">Let's stop pointing accusing finger to
            the west for funding campaigns for the eradication of
            FGM. In any case, the west is not even directly
            disturbed by the practice. Most of us do not know how
            painful the mutilation, which is inflicted on the
            girl-child, is.</p>

            <p class="text">FGM, also called female circumcision,
            is a collective name given to series of traditional
            surgical operations performed on girls in more than 28
            African countries, including the Gambia. In all most of
            these countries, the major defence for the practice is
            that is an aspect of African culture. Fine. But what
            use is a cultural practice that is dangerous to health?
            Are we slaves to traditional practice? Culture is the
            product of man's creation and should be amended
            whenever aspects of it are found to be inimical to
            sound health.</p>

            <p class="text">FGM is an ancient custom, which is
            estimated to affect about 130 million girls and women
            in the world. Every year about two million girls are
            genetically mutilated in the name of culture. The
            origin of FGM is still not clear, but it is practiced
            mainly in Africa. This custom is deeply rooted in both
            women and men's consciousness and is vividly seen as a
            parameter for appropriate womanhood within a clearly
            defined hierarchy and societal mechanism of women's
            sexuality.</p>

            <p class="text">In conservative communities, the rite
            of passage ceremony has lost its educational values,
            but the practice of FGM still continues. Sad!</p>

            <p class="text">According to WHO, FGM is classified as
            follows:</p>

            <p class="text">Type 1: Clitoridectomy - the partial or
            total removal of the clitoris, a small organ located in
            front of the opening to the vagina, which is sensitive
            to touch, and a site of sexual stimulation to the
            female.</p>

            <p class="text">Type 2: Excision - both the clitoris
            and the inner lips (Labia majora) are cut off, living
            the vagina uncovered. This could be rendering it prone
            to bacterial/viral infections, thus leading to
            infertility.</p>

            <p class="text">Type 3: Infibulation - the clitoris is
            removed, partially or totally cutting off the labia
            minora (smaller lips). The surface is either stitched
            together or kept intact by tying it together until it
            heals, covering the urethra and most of the vaginal
            opening, please for God and heaven's sake, don't tell
            me this is not happening in the Gambia as Gambians are
            fond of saying "such does not exists here", while it is
            killing and destroying our social fabric, simply
            because our laissez-faire attitudes.</p>

            <p class="text">Tribes, communities, regions, and
            language groups have variety or rear forms of cutting
            and manipulating the external genitals. Some of these
            reasons are however given to justify the practice. They
            vary from tribe to tribe and community to
            community:</p>

            <p class="text">It is an essential part of our culture
            that must be preserved.</p>

            <p class="text">Female genitals are unclean and will
            grow if not cut.</p>

            <p class="text">It is an initiation into womanhood and
            enhances the husband's sexual pleasure.</p>

            <p class="text">FGM improves fertility and prevents
            infant (girls) and maternal morality.</p>

            <p class="text">It is a religious obligation as it
            prevents sexual promiscuity.</p>

            <p class="text">Well! These are the reasons, think
            about it and compare it with the health-related
            complications, the long and short-term complications;
            it is painful, (no anesthesia!) It is also prone to
            tetanus and HIV/ADIS infection; could cause rude shock
            that can lead to mental disorder. In extreme cases, it
            could cause death.</p>

            <p class="text">The health complications of this
            practice also includes various gynecological,
            psychological and sexual problems.</p>

            <p class="text">These are some self-speaking statistics
            on FGM: 40 percent of Mandinka, 11 percent of Serahule,
            19 percent of Fula, 9 percent of Wollof, 15 percent of
            Jola, and 6 percent of other minority tribes practice
            FGM in the Gambia.</p>

            <p class="text">Many programmes, polices, projects and
            plans have been geared towards the elimination of all
            forms of harmful traditional practices, especially FGM.
            But the lack of general commitment and the will has
            hindered their successful implementation.</p>

            <p class="text">The debate on FGM is sensitive,
            emotional and provocative but with genuine commitments
            and political will, the Gambia will surely speed-up the
            elimination of all harmful traditional practices
            without distorting an iota of the fabric of our
            culture. Thus enhancing the positive and progressive
            norms and values of our beautiful traditions. The
            debate is healthy and not directed at any people,
            tribe, or group of people, but against the violence
            done to the human rights of the girl-child, and women
            at large.</p>

            <p class="text">Many have even advocated the initiation
            without bloody operations; teach the initiates the
            culture and values of being a good woman in
            society.</p>
