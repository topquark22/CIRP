            <h2>State limits circumcision coverage</h2>

            <h4>Medicaid will no longer cover most of the surgeries
            in Florida as state officials seek to reduce
            costs.</h4>

            <p>By ALISA ULFERTS, Times Staff Writer<br />
             &copy; St. Petersburg Times<br />
             published July 1, 2003</p>

            <p>TALLAHASSEE - Florida has taken sides in the
            long-running debate over the medical necessity of
            circumcision. It has joined the opposition.</p>

            <p>Beginning today, the procedure is no longer covered
            by Medicaid in Florida except in limited cases.</p>

            <p>That means a Medicaid mom who wants her newborn
            circumcised will have to find some other way to pay for
            it, while those with private health insurance will
            generally find the procedure is covered.</p>

            <p>It's a cost-saving step, lawmakers say.</p>

            <p>"You have to spend Medicaid dollars on medically
            necessary services," said Rep. Frank Farkas, a St.
            Petersburg Republican and vice chairman of the House
            Subcommittee on Health Appropriations. Research
            suggests circumcision is done more often for cultural
            or religious reasons, Farkas said. "It really was a
            no-brainer."</p>

            <p>The change is expected to save the state
            $2.3-million a year.</p>

            <p>In the past four years, Medicaid paid $5.8-million
            for almost 45,000 circumcisions in Florida.</p>

            <p>Medicaid will continue to cover the procedure in the
            case of injury or other problems.</p>

            <p>But what was once routine procedure performed within
            days of a boy's birth won't be for the poor.</p>

            <p>Circumcision involves the removal of all or part of
            the foreskin of a penis. It is religious ritual in
            Judaism and Islam. Proponents say it helps prevent
            disease, but opponents say the risks are high for
            little return.</p>

            <p>Medicaid has paid between $151.19 and $222.79 per
            circumcision, depending on the type of procedure used
            and whether there are complications.</p>

            <p>Eliminating circumcision was one of several
            cost-saving changes lawmakers made in Medicaid this
            year. Eyeglasses, hearing aids and dentures for the
            poor were among the services deemed nonessential, as
            were some transportation costs.</p>

            <p>Anti-circumcision groups, many of whom equate the
            procedure with genital mutilation, have pushed for this
            change for years, even when the state's coffers were
            flush with cash.</p>

            <p>"This is taxpayer money, and circumcision is a
            procedure with no medical benefit," said Ronald
            Goldman, executive director for the <a
            href="http://www.circumcision.org/">Circumcision
            Resource Center</a>, a Boston-based anti-circumcision
            group. Unless needed to correct a defect, the only
            justification for circumcision is cultural, religious
            or aesthetic, Goldman said.</p>

            <p>"We wouldn't use taxpayer dollars to pay for other
            cosmetic surgery," Goldman said.</p>

            <p>But social services advocate Karen Woodall said the
            change is unfair to poor parents who want to have their
            newborn circumcised for religious or cultural reasons.
            She also objects to the other changes done for
            cost-saving reasons.</p>

            <p>Florida joins 10 other states, including <a
            href="/news/arizonastar05-18-02/">Arizona</a>,
            California and <a
            href="/news/charlotteobserver09-21-02/">North
            Carolina</a>, that won't pay for circumcision under
            Medicaid, which is funded with state and federal
            money.</p>

            <p>"It's understandable that they would want to cut
            this because the <a href="http://www.aap.org/"
            target="_blank">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> has
            said for many years that circumcisions are cosmetic,"
            said Catherine Lynch, a professor of obstetrics and
            gynecology at the <a
            href="http://hsc.usf.edu/medicine/"
            target="_blank">University of South Florida</a>. Yet
            the procedure is widely performed in the United States,
            she noted.</p>

            <p>For Ed Rose, a <a href="http://www.uwf.edu/uwfMain/"
            target="_blank">University of West Florida</a> student
            and head of the Pensacola chapter of the <a
            href="http://members.aol.com/nocircnwfl/NOCIRC.html">Circumcision
            Resource Center</a>, the issue is simple: "Being born
            male is not a disorder requiring surgical correction."
            Rose has been lobbying lawmakers for years to stop
            paying for circumcisions and testified before Farkas'
            committee.</p>

            <p>Pediatricians once recommended circumcision as a way
            to reduce urinary tract and other infections in infants
            and toddlers. The practice is far more common in the
            United States, with about 65 percent of males
            undergoing the procedure. In the rest of the world, 20
            percent of males are circumcised.</p>
