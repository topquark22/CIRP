      <h2>Guidelines Seek to Limit Pain in Newborns</h2>

      <p><b>NEW YORK (Reuters Health) -</b> Newborns are highly
      sensitive to pain and may be more vulnerable to its long-term
      consequences than older children and adults, an international
      committee reports.</p>

      <p>The group's <a href="/library/pain/anand5/">guidelines</a>
      on preventing and managing pain in newborns dispute the
      notion that young infants cannot feel pain and challenge a
      reluctance among doctors to provide pain relievers during
      routine procedures such as blood sampling, immunization and
      circumcision.</p>

      <p><a href="/library/pain/anand/">Research</a> indicates,
      however, that hormonal, metabolic and cardiovascular
      responses to surgery are more pronounced in newborns than in
      older children, the authors note.</p>

      <p>``Management of pain must be considered an important
      component of the health care provided to all neonates,
      regardless of their gestational age or severity of illness,''
      conclude Dr. K.J.S. Anand from <a
      href="http://www.ach.uams.edu/">Arkansas Children's Hospital
      in Little Rock</a> and colleagues from the International
      Evidence-Based Group for Neonatal Pain.</p>

      <p>The <a href="/library/pain/anand5/">recommendations</a>,
      published in the February issue of the Archives of Pediatric
      and Adolescent Medicine, state that doctors should allow
      newborns to be swaddled, kept in close contact with the
      mother or suck on a pacifier with a sugar solution during
      routine procedures such as a blood test. These simple
      measures have been shown to reduce a newborn's reaction to
      pain.</p>

      <p>Topical pain relievers such as lidocaine can be used
      during circumcision. Clamps, which are used to protect the
      penis while the foreskin is being removed, should be used
      during the procedure, and <a
      href="/library/pain/howard/">acetaminophen</a> may be given
      for postoperative pain, the group suggests.</p>

      <p>Lidocaine can be used when a catheter has to be inserted
      in a vein or artery, and stronger drugs such as morphine or
      fentanyl may be given to newborns who require a tube in their
      chest or down their throat.</p>

      <p>``Pain in newborns is often unrecognized and undertreated.
      Neonates do feel pain, and analgesia should be prescribed
      when indicated during their medical care,'' the authors
      assert.</p>

      <p>They argue that the guidelines could ``not only improve
      the clinical care provided to all neonates, but may also have
      a positive impact on their subsequent health and behaviors
      during childhood and adolescence.''</p>

      <p>Indeed, studies have shown that newborns who experience
      extreme pain may be at increased risk for illness and death.
      These experiences may also affect the way a child responds to
      pain in the future. For example, one <a
      href="/library/pain/taddio2/">study</a> showed that babies
      who underwent a painful circumcision were more likely to have
      a more pronounced reaction to immunizations later on.</p>

      <p>The current recommendations are based on a review of
      published medical studies.</p>
