            <p><b>A man circumcised two baby boys in their mothers'
            front rooms after leading them to believe he was a
            medical doctor, a court heard.</b></p>

            <p>Omunnakwe Amechi, 53, would turn up at houses
            smartly dressed and carrying a doctor's kit bag, <a
            href="http://194.176.197.234/council/other/courtcrown.htm"
             target="_blank">Woolwich Crown Court</a> was told.</p>

            <p>But his doctorate was a PhD in chemistry, which was
            to do with the workings of rats' brains, and he had no
            formal medical qualifications.</p>

            <p>Mr Amechi, of Goldsmith Street, Peckham, south-east
            London, denies two charges of unlawful wounding and two
            deception charges.</p>

            <p>Prosecutor Mark Wyeth told the court two boys, aged
            14 months and 19 months, lost a lot of blood and needed
            transfusions and corrective surgery after being
            circumcised by Mr Amechi.</p>

            <p><b>Mistaken belief</b></p>

            <p>He said Mr Amechi used business cards, receipts and
            the title "doctor" given for his PhD to create a false
            impression of medical expertise.</p>

            <p>"The defendant, by his conduct, induced in the
            mothers of these children the mistaken belief that he
            was medically qualified," he said.</p>

            <p>"If he hadn't induced that state of belief neither
            would have consented to their sons being circumcised by
            this man."</p>

            <p>The court heard Mr Amechi had been regularly
            circumcising young boys since 1995.</p>

            <p>His business spread by word of mouth although he had
            no surgery or office.</p>

            <p>But his business cards, which bore the title doctor,
            a phone number and a list of qualifications failed to
            clarify his non-medical status or give his home
            address, the prosecutor said.</p>

            <p>He added there was no formal rules governing
            circumcision and it was not regulated by the <a
            href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/" target="_blank">General
            Medical Council</a> or anyone else.</p>

            <p>But those who performed surgery had to be "very
            clear about their qualifications, very clear about
            their training and need to be capable of carrying it
            out to a high and safe standard," said Mr Wyeth.</p>

            <p>The trial continues.</p>
