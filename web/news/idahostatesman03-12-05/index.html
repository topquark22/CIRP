            <h4>Budget is higher than governor's by $10
            million</h4>

            <p>The House-Senate budget committee on Friday approved
            a spending blueprint for Medicaid that's $10 million
            higher than Gov. Dirk Kempthorne had asked for &mdash;
            on the basis that the governor is overly optimistic
            about forthcoming federal reforms to the health care
            program for the poor and disabled.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">But no one criticized the Joint
            Finance-Appropriations Committee's action, which also
            instructed the <a
            href="http://www.healthandwelfare.idaho.gov/"
            target="_blank">Department of Health and Welfare</a> to
            end the practice of subsidizing infant circumcisions
            (for a savings of $173,000) and to find ways to
            streamline sprawling mental health services.</span></p>

            <p>"It's a thoughtful budget," Kempthorne's Health and
            Welfare adviser, David Lehman, said after the vote. "We
            are very delighted, very pleased with the actions of
            the committee," Health and Welfare director Karl Kurtz
            told legislative budget writers.</p>

            <p>The committee's proposal weighs in at $331 million,
            an increase of 15 percent over the $288 million in
            state taxpayer support that lawmakers set a year
            ago.</p>

            <p>Kempthorne's budget was $321 million. He was hopeful
            that the federal government would give relief to the
            states, which are almost universally struggling with
            annual double-digit increases in Medicaid spending.</p>

            <p>Kempthorne told lawmakers in his State of the State
            speech that his budget "anticipates that we'll find
            additional ways to contain rising costs."</p>

            <p>But he added, "Absent federal reforms in the
            Medicaid system, or drastic or even devastating
            reductions in vital services, we will have to revisit
            this year's Medicaid budget next session."</p>

            <p>Senate Finance Chairman Dean Cameron of Rupert said
            he wasn't comfortable with the prospect of waiting and
            then having to inject another $20 million into the
            budget next year.</p>

            <p>"We all recognize that the governor's number is well
            under what the actual cost will be," Cameron said. "It
            is far more responsible for us to put a reasonable
            number out there."</p>

            <p>"I feel like this is as honest a budget as we can
            come up with," said Rep. Margaret Henbest, a Boise
            Democrat who worked up the budget with Republican Sen.
            John McGee of Caldwell.</p>

            <p>The budget remains more than $8 million less than
            the agency had requested, but lawmakers were confident
            that the agency would find ways to keep costs in
            check.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Part of that effort was the
            joint committee's clear directive that the agency end
            state-supported infant circumcisions unless they are
            medically necessary.</span></p>

            <p>And the committee instructed the department to
            review mental health services for possible overuse.
            Mental health care is one of Medicaid's more rapidly
            growing expenses.</p>

            <p>The panel said the department should look at
            limiting hours and requiring prior approval for
            psychosocial rehabilitation services &mdash; a popular
            set of services provided to help kids and adults with
            serve emotional problems function in the community and
            at home.</p>

            <p>Henbest said the intent is not to limit the
            availability of the service, but to better match the
            services to clients.</p>
