            <h2>30 vehicles to assist initiation monitors</h2>

            <p>By Taralyn Bro</p>

            <p>BHISHO - The forthcoming circumcision season got off
            to a good start yesterday when Health Department
            officials handed over 30 vehicles to medical officers
            to help them monitor initiation schools scattered
            throughout the province.</p>

            <p>Department of Health fleet manager Odwa Matshaya
            said the 30 vehicles represented a R500 million saving
            for the department as they were re- assigned from
            within the department rather than being hired as in
            previous years.</p>

            <p>"The vehicles include 4x4s, double cabs, and
            sedans," said Matshaya at Bhisho Hospital, where they
            were assigned to medical officers.</p>

            <p>"These will be allocated according to the terrain
            where the medical officers will be operating. Our
            province has a vast area that needs to be covered and
            with these vehicles we will be able to reach the
            furthest rural areas."</p>

            <p>The medical officers will have the vehicles until
            the end of February and then return them to the
            department.</p>

            <p>The Department of Health's provincial co-ordinator
            for the circumcision programme, Solo Mkiva, welcomed
            the use of the vehicles which would make it easier for
            the team to inspect circumcision schools.</p>

            <p>"We have managed to decrease the number of
            admissions into hospital and deaths of initiates
            because our medical officers have been able to visit
            lodges all over the province," said Mkiva.</p>

            <p>He estimated that roughly 6000 initiates would
            undergo circumcision this season.</p>

            <p>"Last season, a lot of circumcisions were performed
            illegally," Mkiva acknowledged. "Now, we are guided by
            the Circumcision Act."</p>

            <p>In terms of the Act, initiates and traditional
            surgeons must follow certain guidelines for safety.</p>

            <p>"You must go to a hospital or clinic and be
            examined, you must have the parents' signed consent,
            the traditional surgeon must have a valid form and it
            must be signed by a medical officer," Mkiva
            explained.</p>

            <p>A medical officer and professional nurse from
            Keiskammahoek, Fumana Mabuda, said the vehicles would
            help him greatly as he needed to go into the bush in
            the Amahlati district.</p>

            <p>"I need to travel into the bush and check the
            dressings of wounds. This will help eliminate sepsis
            and amputation," said Mabuda.</p>

            <p>Daily Dispatch records indicate that by the end of
            last year's season 12 initiates had died and 86 had
            been taken to hospitals in the province due to botched
            circumcisions. These figures had shown a decrease from
            December 2002, when <span class="yellow">17 deaths were
            recorded</span> and 156 initiates were admitted to
            hospital.</p>
