      <h2>$1.4M awarded for botched circumcision</h2>

      <p>Associated Press</p>

      <p>Sacramento-- A Sacramento jury awarded $1.42 million to a
      7 year-old boy this week for a botched circumcision performed
      by a first-year resident at <a
      href="http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/">University of
      California, Davis, Medical Center</a>.</p>

      <p>The verdict exceeds the legal cap of $250,000 on medical
      malpractice awards because the hospital failed to obtain the
      parents' permission to operate. After the boy was injured,
      the hospital asked the parents to sign a consent form,
      according to a press release by the parents' attorney.</p>

      <p>The hospital did not immediately respond to calls by the
      Associated Press.</p>

      <p>The boy suffered from a pituitary condition that made
      circumcision difficult and dangerous, said Mark Blake, the
      parents' attorney.</p>

      <p>Blake said a first-year medical resident performed the
      surgery.</p>
