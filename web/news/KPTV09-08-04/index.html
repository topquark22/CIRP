            <p>RIDGEFIELD, Wash. - A <a
            href="http://www.ridgefieldwash.com/"
            target="_blank">Ridgefield</a>, Washington, man faces
            assault charges after trying to circumcise his
            eight-year-old son with a kitchen knife.</p>

            <p>Edward Baxter is being held in the <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/" target="_blank">Clark
            County</a> jail on $50,000 bail.</p>

            <p>Baxter told police that he numbed the boy's penis
            with ice before attempting the circumcision at home.
            The eight-year-old has only minor injuries.</p>

            <p>Baxter was arrested and charged with <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/boyle1/">assault</a>.</p>

            <p>Prosecutor Kim Farr says the Ridgefield man was
            inspired by the Bible, which says that all men should
            be circumcised.</p>

            <p>Baxter and his wife have nine children.</p>
