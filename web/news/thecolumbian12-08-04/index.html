            <h2>Father convicted in circumcision attempt</h2>

            <p>Wednesday, December 8, 2004<br />
             <b>By STEPHANIE RICE, Columbian staff writer</b></p>

            <p>A jury deliberated 40 minutes Tuesday before
            convicting a Ridgefield man of assault for attempting
            to circumcise his 8-year-old.</p>

            <p>Edwin B. Baxter, 33, was polite after the verdict as
            he was handcuffed to be taken back to the <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/sheriff/custody/Index.html"
             target="_blank">Clark County Jail</a>. He thanked his
            attorney and the prosecutor, who last week offered
            Baxter a plea deal that would've given the father of
            nine credit for the three months spent in custody and
            released him from jail. He declined.</p>

            <p>Now, Baxter faces up to three years and five months
            in prison.</p>

            <p>A truck driver and fundamentalist Christian who
            wears a long beard, Baxter dressed in flannel shirts
            and work boots during his two-day trial and had a Bible
            with him in court. He did not testify before the jury
            of seven men and five women.</p>

            <p>He did, however, make a statement to Judge James
            Rulli for the purpose of preserving his right to appeal
            on the grounds Rulli did not allow him to use his faith
            as a defense.</p>

            <p>Baxter said he decided to circumcise his 8-year-old,
            the eldest of his four boys, on Sept. 3 after he read
            in the Old Testament that males should undergo the
            procedure.</p>

            <p>"I had no reason to think I would be in violation of
            any of God's laws," Baxter said.</p>

            <p>"I felt it was an act of obedience."</p>

            <p>He said he was only following in the footsteps of
            Abraham, Isaac and "every other godly man."</p>

            <p>He had his son lay on towels in what was described
            by witnesses as a dirty bathtub. He used a hunting
            knife to attempt the procedure, but called 911 when his
            son began bleeding profusely.</p>

            <p>"It breaks my heart to think that this state would
            think of me as a child abuser," Baxter said.</p>

            <p>Senior Deputy Prosecutor <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/pa/criminal/childabuse.html"
             target="_blank">Kim Farr</a> asked whether the
            circumcision would have been equally symbolic if it had
            been performed by a doctor in a sterile
            environment.</p>

            <p>"I have no reason to think otherwise," Baxter
            said.</p>

            <p>Farr said after the trial that Baxter's son was not
            circumcised at birth because none of the Baxter
            children have been born in hospitals. He said the
            family used a van outside their Ridgefield home as a
            birthing place.</p>

            <p>Baxter's 30-year-old wife, Tammy, is said to be
            pregnant with her 10th child.</p>

            <p>She and the children have not been found by law
            enforcement or investigators from the state <a
            href="https://fortress.wa.gov/dshs/caoffices/internetapps/ca/display.asp?officeName=Vancouver%20DCFS"
             target="_blank">Department of Children and Family
            Services</a>, who had been seeking them in connection
            with the trial.</p>

            <p>After the verdict, <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/courts/superior/judges.html"
             target="_blank">Judge Rulli</a> dismissed <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/thecolumbian10-13-04/"
            target="_blank">arrest warrants</a> for Tammy Baxter
            and the victim.</p>

            <p>A urologist who treated the victim said he has not
            seen the boy to know if his wound has healed.</p>

            <p>Dr. Douglas Masson said he closed the boy's wound,
            rather than complete the circumcision, to let it heal
            and to minimize the chance of infection.</p>

            <p>However, scar tissue could require that the boy be
            circumcised in the future, he said.</p>
