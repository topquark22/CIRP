            <h2>Drama As 'Cut' Youth Hits Back</h2>

            <p>There was drama at a circumcision ceremony in
            Bungoma District when an initiate attacked and injured
            a traditional circumciser.</p>

            <p>The traditional surgeon fled for dear life as the
            18-year-old youth turned violent immediately after his
            foreskin was chopped off.</p>

            <p>The incident occurred at Kisioyi village, West
            Bukusu location, in Bumula Division, on Tuesday
            morning.</p>

            <p>The youth, who was among the oldest in the on-going
            Kolongolo circumcision group, was, however, overpowered
            and rushed to Bungoma District Hospital where nurses
            operated on the skin.</p>
            However, three other youths who were together with the
            victim, stood firmly for the initiators. 

            <p>Uncles of the victim had to use huge rungus to scare
            off the youth who attacked the circumciser with a
            stick.</p>

            <p>At the hospital, relatives had to combine forces to
            force the initiate onto a bed before operating on him
            as he cried loudly.</p>

            <p>Elders said the incident was shameful to the
            community and expressed fear that the boy may never
            marry in his life because no girl would accept a man
            who has no bravery.</p>
