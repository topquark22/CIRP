      <h2>Foreskin lament for babies</h2>

      <p>09 JANUARY 2001</p>

      <p><b>Circumcision became widespread in New Zealand after
      World War 1, but later in the 20th century the practice
      diminished sharply. Yvonne Martin looks at an unusual chapter
      of medical history.</b></p>

      <p>It was like a tsunami that began around World War 1, swept
      over the nation's nurseries, and receded just as quickly.</p>

      <p>Yet no-one seems sure why New Zealand embraced
      circumcision so enthusiastically and rejected it with similar
      zest, all within one generation.</p>

      <p>Over the last five years, <a
      href="http://www.aut.ac.nz/external.shtml"
      target="_blank">Auckland University of Technology</a> senior
      lecturer in pathology Ken McGrath has tracked the history of
      circumcision in New Zealand as best he can, with the scant
      medical records that exist.</p>

      <p>He uncovered a surreal story of medical fashion,
      unquestioned authority of doctors, and a lack of ethical
      awareness. Throw into the mixture strong forces of social
      conformity and rapid change, and the result is a unique slice
      of New Zealand medico-cultural history.</p>

      <p>Mr McGrath presented his findings to the Sixth
      International Symposium on Genital Integrity at the <a
      href="http://www.usyd.edu.au/" target="_blank">University of
      Sydney</a> in early December.</p>

      <p>Among experts, the foreskin is recognised for its
      important sensory function. In the 1890s, boys were
      circumcised to discourage masturbation, which was thought to
      overstimulate the spinal chord and lead to a plethora of
      diseases.</p>

      <p>Circumcision gained momentum during World War 1 for other
      reasons. The army medical branch believed that hygiene was a
      major factor behind a rise in sexually transmitted diseases
      during major wars&mdash;and the foreskin had to go.</p>

      <p>According to a Dunedin doctor who had performed
      circumcisions since 1916, the operation was rare in New
      Zealand before the World War 1, says Mr McGrath.</p>

      <p>"The foreskin came to be considered as enclosing a space
      which would act as a `cultural medium' for bacterial growth
      and a trap for pollution &mdash; a veritable cesspool," he
      says.</p>

      <p>Its removal was seen as a way of getting a man well enough
      to return to the frontline, with the added bonus of reducing
      his sexual capacity and therefore his risk of
      reinfection.</p>

      <p>This hygiene argument for circumcision appears to have
      reached NZ's civilian population through the many doctors who
      served in the army, says Mr McGrath.</p>

      <p>By the late 1930s, New Zealand rates of circumcision
      appear to have equalled Britain's. A survey of British men
      born between 1934 and 1944 found 38 per cent were cut. Of New
      Zealand fathers born around the same time, 40 per cent were
      done, says Mr McGrath.</p>

      <p>But during the early years of World War 2, New Zealand's
      rates rocketed to probably as high as 95 per cent, says Mr
      McGrath. From his own observations, men born between 1941 and
      1948 were rarely left intact.</p>

      <p>"This suggests that the rate of early-childhood
      circumcision went from about 35 per cent just before World
      War 2 to over 90 per cent by 1942, a rise of over 50 per cent
      in three years," he says.</p>

      <p>"We have tried for some time to find an account of why
      this sudden enthusiasm occurred, and from where it
      originated, by searching official medical and wartime
      records, without finding anything that even hints at what
      happened."</p>

      <p>A recurring theme, though, from medical student surveys in
      the 1960s and 1970s was hygiene problems for troops in desert
      theatres and prisoner-of-war camps.</p>

      <p>The fear that sons who were not "fixed" would have serious
      foreskin problems should they find themselves in another
      desert war, has become known as the sand myth. Mr McGrath
      says he has found no evidence to support this notion.</p>

      <p>The official record of World War 2 military medicine (by
      Sir Duncan Stout) makes no mention of circumcision or
      foreskin problems. It also reports a great reluctance to cut
      skin because of the extreme difficulty keeping out the
      irritating fine flour-like dust in the Sahara.</p>

      <p>Mr McGrath believes the sand myth somehow became an
      unquestioned truth among doctors and parents in New Zealand
      and Australia.</p>

      <p>Britain's circumcision rate had begun to fall during World
      War 2 and plummeted when its new National Health Service
      decided against funding the procedures in 1947 (having judged
      it unnecessary and cosmetic).</p>

      <p>Two years later a <a
      href="/library/general/gairdner/">study</a> by a prominent
      British pediatrician Douglas Gairdner on foreskin development
      in children disputed the common reasons for circumcision.</p>

      <p>The NHS decision had little impact in New Zealand, but
      Gairdner's and other British medical articles against
      circumcision eventually filtered back to doctors here.</p>

      <p>Mr McGrath says that by 1961 the <a
      href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/animatedmenu/frame.html"
      target="_blank">Otago Medical School</a> was teaching that
      circumcision had little or no place in medical practice. The
      few doctors who remained in support of routinely cutting
      babies were mostly older, more senior, and the subjects of
      circumcision in their own infancies.</p>

      <p>However, it took two decades for parents to drop
      circumcision, says Mr McGrath. Doctors generally tried to
      dissuade parents, but in the end if a parent demanded it,
      doctors did it or referred them to someone who did, he
      says.</p>

      <p>"What doctors had not anticipated was the extent to which
      the public had taken to the practice."</p>

      <p>Most parents surveyed around this era still believed
      circumcision was essential for hygiene. Others considered it
      necessary for family conformity.</p>

      <p>Having a circumcised father, a grandmother in favour, or
      circumcised brothers were highly significant risk factors for
      intact baby boys.</p>

      <p>"There was, and probably still is, a national reluctance
      to stand out, and intolerance of anyone who did, from the
      perceived social norms&mdash;the Tall Poppy Syndrome," says
      Mr McGrath.</p>

      <p>"This may partially explain why parents thought their sons
      should be the same as their peers, as well as resemble their
      fathers and brothers."</p>

      <p>Christchurch, well known for its conservatism, was a
      hotbed of circumcision, he says.</p>

      <p>When national rates had fallen to low levels, one
      Christchurch study of 590 boys born in 1977 found that one in
      four had been cut, mostly before they were five months old.
      By comparison, in Dunedin&mdash;where doctors
      trained&mdash;only 5 per cent of boys were cut that year.</p>

      <p>As the public system gradually reduced the number of
      circumcisions it performed, the private sector took over.
      Public hospitals still do circumcisions for medical
      reasons.</p>

      <p>National health statistics for all hospitals show that by
      1995 less than 1 per cent of boys under four years were
      circumcised, says Mr McGrath.</p>

      <p>New Zealand now has one of the lowest rates of
      circumcision in the world. Circumcision is still the norm for
      Samoans, Tongans, Jews, and Muslims.</p>

      <p>Spencer Beasley, professor of pediatric surgery at <a
      href="http://www.chl.govt.nz/chchhosp.asp"
      target="_blank">Christchurch Hospital</a>, says most
      pediatric surgeons do not believe in doing circumcisions
      routinely.</p>

      <p>But they do see medical advantages in some cases, says
      Professor Beasley, president of the New Zealand Society of
      Pediatric Surgeons.</p>

      <p>"If some parents very strongly wanted their children
      circumcised, we would be happy to do that," he says. "One of
      the difficulties is that there are actually some advantages
      in being circumcised in terms of being able to clean under
      the foreskin. There may also be a reduced risk of getting
      sexually transmitted diseases."</p>

      <p>A study of circumcision in Pacific Island families living
      in Christchurch found they strongly embraced the practice, as
      have their predecessors for the last 150 years, mostly for
      cultural and religious reasons.</p>

      <p>Most circumcisions are now performed by pediatric
      surgeons, using both general and local anaesthetic. They cost
      $800 to $2000.</p>

      <p>"They have a light anaesthetic so they don't have the
      trauma of the experience and when they wake up they are not
      in much pain," says Professor Beasley.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.racp.edu.au/"
      target="_blank">Royal Australasian College of Physicians</a>
      is drafting guidelines for circumcision in New Zealand and
      Australia.</p>
