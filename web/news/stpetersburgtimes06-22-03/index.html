            <p>TALLAHASSEE - This is about a boy named Jeffery who
            suffered a terrible injury at the hands of
            inexperienced doctors. It happened 19 years ago in
            another state but the <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/1986.05.28_lawsuit/">story</a>
            has a lot to say about Florida's current medical
            malpractice dispute.</p>

            <p>If you are squeamish, please stop here.</p>

            <p>Jeffery was 2 years old when he underwent a
            therapeutic circumcision that went horribly wrong. A
            first-year family practice resident physician being
            supervised by a third-year surgical resident used a
            high-frequency electronic cutting tool instead of a
            conventional scalpel. There was too much current, too
            much heat. "Eventually," wrote a Louisiana Court of
            Appeal, "his external penile tissue sloughed away,
            leaving him with no visible penile tissue. In simple
            terms, his penis was gone."</p>

            <p>This happened at a charity hospital for which the
            state was responsible. Jeffery's father sued the state
            and the manufacturer, exposing a cascading chain of
            negligence. Among other things, the senior resident had
            never asked her supervisors whether it was safe to use
            the device for a circumcision (it wasn't) and the
            hospital only selectively enforced its requirement that
            a member of the medical school staff or a certified
            general surgeon oversee all elective surgery.</p>

            <p>The main question before the appeals court was how
            much the state should pay: $2,750,000 recommended by
            the jury or $1,730,000 favored by the judge. The three
            appeals judges found the larger sum more reasonable.
            Only $118,000 was for past and future medical expenses.
            The rest was for pain and suffering. The judges
            explained why.</p>

            <p>"The record shows that Jeffery suffered greatly as
            the tissue of his penis withered away from the burn.
            For days he screamed "it hurts.' There was nothing that
            could be done to save the tissue. Jeffery now has no
            visible penis tissue left. The medical testimony
            presented two future alternatives. The first is
            possible reconstructive surgery when he reaches puberty
            . . . to make the stump of the penis appear more
            prominent . . . Jeffrey's second alternative is for a
            sex change operation.</p>

            <p>". . . Jeffery's psychiatrist testified that the
            child will need intermittent psychiatric counseling to
            help him cope with crises as they occur. She said that
            there is a high possibility his loss will affect his
            self-identity . . . that Jeffery will undoubtedly
            experience anger and frustration as he grows older and
            probably will direct that anger against his
            parents.</p>

            <p>"The usual guidelines - pain and suffering,
            disability, loss of income, future medical - are
            inappropriate to measure this loss. Pain, the doctors
            say, though intense at first, is now gone. Future
            medical treatment and expenses could be enormous, but
            no one knows for sure. The urination function is
            accommodated by a still-working, albeit shorter,
            urethra. As a physical person who can eat, drink,
            sleep, work, think, Jeffery probably can meet objective
            standards for normal performance.</p>

            <p>"It is elsewhere that his loss lies. Sexual
            pleasure, procreativity, marriage in any normal sense,
            these things will never exist for him. The suffering of
            deprivation, both physical and mental, that will
            accompany him throughout his life can be only vaguely
            imagined. What will his puberty be like? Where will he
            go to escape the cruel and ribald jokes of his
            comrades? For that matter who will be his comrades?
            Into what corner of his dark cell will he seek refuge
            when the natural urgings of his body wage battle?</p>

            <p>"There is a suggestion in the evidence that he can
            be changed into a woman. As a means of mitigating
            damages in this case, we view this prospect as pure
            speculation. If it is realistic to imagine that he may
            find a new life in this way, it is just as realistic to
            speculate that after the sex change, he may wish it had
            never been done . . ."</p>

            <p>If something like this were to happen to a child in
            Florida under the law as Gov. Jeb Bush wants the law to
            be, the court could award only $250,000 for his pain
            and impaired life. That is far less than it typically
            costs a law firm to prepare and try such a case, so one
            practical - and intended result - of Bush's draconian
            cap would be to keep victims out of court. Much gross
            medical negligence would go unpunished.</p>

            <p>The governor is rightly concerned by the high
            insurance premiums that are driving Florida doctors out
            of practice and out of state. But I wonder why such an
            intelligent man is willing to trust the insurance
            industry's word for why this is happening. And I worry
            that he seems to care so little about potential victims
            like Jeffery.</p>

            <p>Money judgment, though it is as old as the Bible, is
            an imperfect remedy for any injury. But it's the best
            we have.</p>

            <p>Louisiana has a $500,000 ceiling on non-economic
            damages that apparently did not apply in such a severe
            case. Similarly, the $500,000 cap reluctantly approved
            by the Florida Senate would permit exceptions of up to
            $2-million (or $6-million in rare cases where doctors,
            hospitals and manufacturers were all held liable) for
            catastrophic injuries including loss of reproductive
            function.</p>

            <p>The governor thinks that's still too generous. Do
            you?</p>
