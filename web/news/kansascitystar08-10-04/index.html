            circumcised</h2>

            <p><b>By STEVE ROCK</b><br />
             <b><small>The Kansas City Star</small></b></p>

            <p>The father of an almost 3-year-old boy had his son
            circumcised last week, registering moot at least a
            portion of a petition before the <a
            href="http://www.courts.mo.gov/sup/index.nsf"
            target="_blank">Missouri Supreme Court</a>.</p>

            <p>The boy's mother, Camille Azar of Lee's Summit,
            filed a petition for a writ of prohibition in mid-July
            and effectively asked the state's highest court to
            reverse a decision previously made in <a
            href="http://www.16thcircuit.org/"
            target="_blank">Jackson County Circuit Court</a>. She
            was hoping to stop Ray Jagoda, the child's father, from
            having their son circumcised.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the case.</p>

            <p>Earlier this year, Jackson County Circuit <a
            href="http://www.16thcircuit.org/Divisions/division.asp?div=31"
             target="_blank">Judge Christine Sill-Rogers</a>
            granted full custody to Jagoda. Included in her order
            was a stipulation: &ldquo;When there is disagreement
            regarding medical treatment, dental treatment and any
            health-care issue, father shall be the final, sole
            decision-maker.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Azar didn't want Jagoda to have their son
            circumcised, she wrote in her petition, because the
            procedure was &ldquo;unneeded and irreparable.&rdquo;
            On Monday, she said her son &ldquo;had something
            precious taken away from him forever.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Jagoda, who is Jewish, initially wanted the
            circumcision for religious reasons. But he said a
            recent examination revealed that his son &ldquo;would
            have had a lot of problems&rdquo; had he not been
            circumcised.</p>

            <p>Though he declined to discuss details, he said the
            procedure went well and that his son was under general
            anesthesia when the circumcision was performed.</p>
