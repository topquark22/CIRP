      <h2>Jail Sentences Possible for Illegal Circumcision School
      Operators</h2>

      <p>Pretoria</p>

      <p>People who operate circumcision schools in the <a
      href="http://www.northern-province.gov.za/"
      target="_blank">Northern Province</a> in contravention of
      regulations gazetted this week, could get a fine or prison
      sentence of up to five years.</p>

      <p>Anyone who abducts a person to a circumcision school is
      guilty of an offence and can go to jail for up to 10 years,
      according to the regulations published in an extraordinary
      provincial gazette.</p>

      <p>The premier published them in terms of the <a
      href="http://www.limpopo.gov.za/docs/pr/showpr.asp?ID=41"
      target="_blank">Circumcision Schools Act of 1996</a>.</p>

      <p>"No person below the age of sixteen can be admitted to a
      circumcision school," the regulations stipulate.</p>

      <p>They also require parental consent for any initiate
      younger than 21 years.</p>

      <p>In terms of the regulations anyone wishing to conduct a
      circumcision school, any traditional doctor who wants to
      perform operations at such a school or any traditional nurse
      wishing to treat initiates must apply for a permit from the
      provincial government.</p>

      <p>No such permit will be granted without the applicant
      having completed training on the safe running of circumcision
      schools, as determined by the health MEC.</p>

      <p>In their applications, organisers must submit, among
      others, a list of all initiates to be admitted to the school,
      proof of their ages and medical certificates for each of them
      stating that they are fit to undergo circumcision.</p>

      <p>The premier may designate medical practitioners to inspect
      circumcision schools.</p>

      <p>Traditional doctors' applications to perform operations
      must be accompanied by certificates from the inspectors that
      their surgical instruments are fit for the purpose and of
      sufficient quality.</p>

      <p>No circumcision school's operations may run concurrently
      with the academic activities of schools or educational
      institutions, the regulations state.</p>
