            <p><b>ACCRA, Ghana (AP) -- A judge in northern Ghana
            has sentenced a 70-year-old woman to five years in
            prison for violating a ban on circumcising girls,
            saying the tough sentence should deter an "outmoded
            custom."</b></p>

            <p>Ghana in 1994 outlawed the practice of cutting away
            parts of girls' sexual organs, but the long-held rite
            of passage has continued in parts of West Africa,
            mostly rural areas where education campaigns are only
            beginning to reach largely illiterate and highly
            traditional populations.</p>

            <p>Prosecution is rare, throughout West Africa.</p>

            <p>Judge Jacob Boon on Friday handed down the five-year
            sentence after the defendant admitted in court in Bawku
            that she continued initiating girls into womanhood, "as
            demanded by our custom," court documents showed.</p>

            <p>"I hope the sentence will serve as a deterrent to
            other practitioners of the outmoded custom, that the
            law would not deal leniently with anyone who continued
            to perpetuate it," Boon said, according to documents
            sent from the court, 500 miles north of Ghana's
            capital, Accra.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.who.int/en/"
            target="_blank">World Health Organization</a> estimates
            up to 140 million girls -- most of them in 28 African
            countries -- have been subjected to female genital
            cutting.</p>
