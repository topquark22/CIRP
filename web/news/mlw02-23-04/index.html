            <h3>Excess Skin Removed During Infant's
            Circumcision<br />
            $110,000 Settlement</h3>

            <p>The minor plaintiff was born on Feb. 12, 1997.
            According to the medical records, the defendant
            performed a circumcision on the minor plaintiff five
            days after his birth. <span class="yellow">Following
            the procedure, the minor plaintiff's penis bled
            profusely requiring several sutures. His hematocrit
            dropped from 45.9 to 34.1 after the
            circumcision.</span></p>

            <p>After being discharged from the hospital, the minor
            plaintiff was referred to a pediatric urologist who
            examined the minor plaintiff and noted that his penis
            was virtually devoid of shaft skin. The urologist noted
            that the condition of the minor plaintiff's penis was
            highly suggestive of excess penile shaft skin being
            removed at the time of circumcision.</p>

            <p>In October 1998, the minor plaintiff underwent
            reconstructive surgery by the urologist. An additional
            reconstructive procedure reportedly was necessary in
            order to attempt to rectify the damage done during the
            circumcision. The case was resolved when the minor
            plaintiff was almost 7 years old; he did not sustain
            any loss of sensation or function. The case resolved
            mainly on the minor plaintiff's claims of pain and
            suffering and the residual scarring caused as a result
            of the initial procedure and the subsequent surgical
            procedures.</p>

            <p>The defendant maintained that he was not negligent
            in performing the circumcision. He further maintained
            that the minor plaintiff's medical condition
            predisposed him to excessive bleeding, that the clamp
            used carried with it the risk of excess skin being
            removed and that the subsequent surgery was
            unnecessary.</p>

            <p>The case settled on the eve of the second trial date
            for $110,000.</p>
