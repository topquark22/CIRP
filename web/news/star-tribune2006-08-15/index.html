            <h2>Why circumcise?</h2>
            Cultural preference, not medicine, drives the decision
            of whether or not to circumcise baby boys. And mostly
            that depends on your religion and where you live. 

            <p><a href="mailto:marcotty@startribune.com">Josephine

             Melissa King</p>

            <p>Many of Sara Stephenson's friends are taken aback
            when she tells them that her son will not be
            circumcised after his birth next month. Some have
            reminded her of an episode in the TV series "Sex and
            the City" in which the female characters are repulsed
            by the thought of having sex with an uncircumcised
            man.</p>

            <p>She wouldn't want that to happen to her son, would
            she?</p>

            <p>"I tell them it's just a TV show," said Stephenson,
            34, of Chaska.</p>

            <p>Still, this is just one of the many issues that
            parents struggle with when they face the decision of
            whether to circumcise their sons. Yes, there are some
            minor health aspects to the decision, but experts say
            there is no clear medical reason to remove the foreskin
            of an infant's penis. The choice is largely driven by
            cultural preference.</p>

            <p>In the United States, most boy babies are
            circumcised because most American men are. That, and
            the fact that circumcision is usually paid for by
            health insurance, is why the practice continues, said
            Eli Coleman, a professor and director of the <a
            href="http://www.fp.umn.edu/fm/phs/home.html"
            target="_blank">Program on Human Sexuality</a> at the
            <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/twincities/index.php"
            target="_blank">University of Minnesota</a>.</p>

            <p>"We are all trying to look like a man ... is
            supposed to," he said.</p>

            <p>That's also why leaving their son uncircumcised is a
            natural choice for Stephenson and her husband, Paul,
            30. They're British. And in Great Britain, with the
            exception of Jewish and Muslim religious practices,
            boys aren't routinely circumcised. They haven't been
            since the early 1950s, when the <a
            href="http://www.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">National
            Health Service</a> stopped paying for it.</p>

            <p>"The treatment is cosmetic and totally unnecessary,"
            said Paul Stephenson.</p>

            <p><a href="/news/star-tribune09-01-05/"
            target="_blank">This year the state of Minnesota
            stopped covering routine circumcisions for the 670,000
            low-income Minnesotans covered by taxpayer-funded
            health plans</a>. Before that, about 10,000 baby boys
            were circumcised annually at an average cost of $54
            each.</p>

            <p>But that change in circumcision policy has prompted
            many physicians to predict that private insurance won't
            be far behind. Most private plans still cover routine
            circumcision and have no plans to change, said health
            plan officials. But "the writing is on the wall," said
            Dr. John O'Connell, a pediatrician who practices at
            clinics in Edina, Burnsville and Shakopee.</p>

            <p>"We are concerned that this is not going to be
            covered by commercial insurers as time goes on," said
            Dr. Peter Dehnel, medical director for the <a
            href="http://www.cpnonline.org/"
            target="_blank">Children's Physician Network</a>, a
            statewide organization of pediatric clinics.</p>

            <p>So some clinics are preparing to do circumcisions in
            the doctor's office, as opposed to hospital nurseries.
            O'Connell said his clinics are planning to charge $300.
            That way, parents who want the procedure but don't have
            coverage will pay much less than it would cost in the
            hospital, he said. Rates for circumcision vary,
            hospital officials said, but would most likely cost
            $700 or more if done in a hospital.</p>

            <p>"That health plan thing is shocking to me," said Lee
            Anne Swanson-Peet, 35, of St. Paul, who was attending a
            recent prenatal class with the Stephensons at <a
            href="http://www.abbottnorthwestern.com/ahs/anw.nsf/"
            target="_blank">Abbott Northwestern Hospital</a> in
            Minneapolis. O'Connell, who gave a talk about infants
            during the class, warned the group to check with their
            health plans to make sure circumcision is covered.</p>

            <p>Swanson-Peet said that if she has a boy he will be
            circumcised, partly because she is Jewish. "But I would
            do it anyway," she said, because she wants him to look
            like his father, and because it's the norm in the
            United States.</p>

            <p>It's unclear if dropping circumcision from insurance
            coverage would have an effect on its frequency.
            HealthPartners tried that for a while in the mid-1980s,
            and finally gave in to public and medical pressure and
            started covering it again in the mid-1990s, said Dr.
            George Isham, medical director of <a
            href="http://www.healthpartners.com/"
            target="_blank">HealthPartners</a>.</p>

            <p>"That decision was based on the notion that this was
            a patient dis-satisfier, and there was not a clear
            consensus in the medical profession," he said.</p>

            <p>It is, nonetheless, one of the few cosmetic
            procedures that insurance does cover routinely, Isham
            said. The only other one he could think of, he said,
            was breast reconstruction after cancer surgery.</p>

            <p>Although no one knows its origin, circumcision has
            been around for thousands of years in many cultures.
            Egyptian mummies have been found to be circumcised, and
            wall paintings from that era depict ritual
            circumcisions. It is an ancient ritual in both Muslim
            and Jewish religions, but not generally associated with
            Christian or Eastern religions.</p>

            <p>Belief in its health benefits arose in the 19th
            century. Doctors advised using circumcision as a
            treatment for practices that were considered sexual
            problems, such as masturbation. During World War II,
            U.S. military personnel were circumcised as a way of
            reducing sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

            <p>In the mid-1970s, an estimated 80 percent of boys
            were circumcised nationwide, but the number declined in
            subsequent decades.</p>

            <p><b>Rates are climbing again</b></p>

            <p>Now, the number appears to be rising again. An
            analysis of inpatient hospital data published in the
            <i>Journal of Urology</i> in 2005 showed that
            nationwide rates climbed from 48 percent between 1988
            and 1991 to 61 percent by 2000.</p>

            <p>But those percentages varied widely by geography. It
            was highest in the Midwest and Northeast -- averaging
            71 percent and 68.9 percent respectively, and lowest in
            the West -- 28 percent. Most of the increase occurred
            in the South, which averaged 53 percent, said Dr. Caleb
            Nelson, lead author of the study and a pediatric
            urologist at <a
            href="http://www.childrenshospital.org/"
            target="_blank">Children's Hospital</a> in Boston. The
            research does not explain why those changes occurred,
            he said, but it may be linked to a population shift
            from North to South during that period.</p>

            <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
            estimates that in 1999 the national average rate was 65
            percent.</p>

            <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: In 2004, the average rate
            of non-therapeutic circumcision of newborn boys in the
            United States was 55% and in a declining trend,
            according to the National Inpatient Sample. This is the
            lowest rate since approximately 1935.]</p>

            <p>The practice persists despite the fact that leading
            <span class="yellow">medical organizations have said
            there is no clear medical benefit.</span> And although
            circumcision used to be done without local anesthesia,
            that's no longer the case. With anesthesia, doctors say
            that most babies appear to feel little discomfort.</p>

            <p>It has, however, always been a contentious procedure
            in medicine. And in 1999 the <a
            href="http://www.aap.org" target="_blank">American
            Academy of Pediatrics</a> adopted a hands-off policy.
            It says that doctors should provide parents with the
            medical pros and cons -- and then let them decide.</p>

            <p>"This is the perfect situation where you ought to
            let people choose," said Isham.</p>

            <p>And most parents choose circumcision because they
            want their sons to look like their fathers, or because
            they are worried that their sons might look different
            than other boys, doctors say.</p>

            <p>"It's not what the girls think, it's what the boys
            will think," said Coleman. "It's that father and son
            will go into the shower and be comparing their penises,
            that this is what a good man looks like."</p>

            <p>Some parents find that ridiculous.</p>

            <p>"I remember telling one of my friends, 'If your
            husband had blue eyes and your son had brown, would you
            give him contacts?' "said Michelle Cunningham, 45, of
            Minneapolis, who has two sons. "Why do their penises
            have to match?"</p>
