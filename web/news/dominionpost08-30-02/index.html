            <p>CIRCUMCISION is no `quick snip' and there is no good
            medical reason for babies to have the procedure, four
            expert health bodies in New Zealand have said in a
            landmark position statement.</p>

            <p>They say circumcision is painful, risky and often
            medically unnecessary.</p>

            <p>For the first time, the division of paediatrics and
            child health of the <a href="http://www.racp.edu.au/"
            target="_blank">Royal Australasian College of
            Physicians</a>, the Australasian Association of
            Paediatric Surgeons, New Zealand Society of Paediatric
            Surgeons and Urological Society of Australasia have
            combined their expert resources and formulated a joint
            position statement on circumcision.</p>

            <p>Professor Spencer Beasley, chairman of the
            circumcision working party, said: "Circumcision is
            quite a painful procedure with significant risks but
            often the general public think it's just a quick snip.
            The college has reviewed evidence in relation to risks
            and benefits and has concluded there is no evidence of
            benefit outweighing harm for circumcision as a routine
            procedure."</p>

            <p>Professor Beasley said the fashion for circumcision
            began in World War II in North Africa where soldiers
            often went days without showers and inflammation of the
            foreskin from sand was the most common cause of
            absenteeism from the front line.</p>
