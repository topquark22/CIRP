            <p>When Nancy McIlvaine told her parents that her
            newborn son wouldn't be circumcised, her mother gasped.
            McIlvaine, who lives in Napa with her husband, Willem
            Maas, said she consulted with health professionals
            about circumcision and never heard a compelling reason
            to snip her baby's foreskin.<br />
            <br />
             "It's just inflicting pain to a newborn when there
            doesn't seem to be any evidence of it being
            beneficial," said McIlvaine, who gave birth to Theodore
            on June 8.<br />
            <br />
             McIlvaine is part of a growing trend away from male
            circumcision. According to the Centers for Disease
            Control and Prevention, the circumcision rate in the
            United States dropped to 55.9 percent in 2003 -- an
            all-time postwar low. In the early '60s, it peaked at
            90 percent.<br />
            <br />
             In the Bay Area, the numbers are even lower. Dr.
            Laurence S. Baskin, chief of pediatric urology at UC
            San Francisco, said, "I would say it's only 40 percent
            in San Francisco. People are more educated about the
            reasons for it now. In the past it was part of the
            package: You had a boy, he was circumcised and you
            would be sent home with a car seat, and that was
            it."<br />
            <br />
             Immigration also is a big factor in the decrease in
            male circumcision nationwide, Baskin said. Among Asian
            cultures and Latin American cultures, circumcision is
            the exception, not the norm.<br />
            <br />
             During the 1950s, the rate of routine infant
            circumcision leapt from 50 to 90 percent in response to
            the advice of medical doctors, like the author <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/info/spock.html"
             target="_blank">Dr. Benjamin Spock</a>, who argued
            that it was beneficial.<br />
            <br />
             But in 1999, after decades of debate, the American
            Academy of Pediatrics issued a <a
            href="/library/statements/aap1999/">policy statement on
            circumcision</a> stating, "Existing scientific evidence
            demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male
            circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to
            recommend routine neonatal circumcision."<br />
            <br />
             When Baskin speaks to parents of infant boys, he
            describes the pros and cons of the procedure. On the
            pro side: Circumcision can decrease the likelihood of
            urinary tract infections, penile cancer, HIV and
            sexually transmitted diseases. On the con side:
            Circumcision has a small risk factor, like any surgery,
            and in most cases is unnecessary. With good hygiene, an
            uncircumcised male can maintain good health throughout
            life.<br />
            <br />
             <span class="yellow">Baskin said that most of the
            clinical studies measuring the reduction of HIV, STDs
            and penile cancer were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa
            and "not really germane to people living in San
            Francisco." Penile cancer, he said, is a problem in
            Africa but almost unheard-of in the United
            States.</span><br />
            <br />
             Dan Savage, a popular sex adviser whose Savage Love
            column is syndicated to 70 newspapers, has a 9-year-old
            adopted son, Daryl. When he and his partner, Terry
            Miller, made the decision not to circumcise, he said,
            "My parents didn't interfere. They had their three sons
            circumcised because that's what everyone did, but
            they're informed enough now to know that it's not what
            everyone does. It's a choice that parents make."<br />
            <br />
             Initially, Savage said, "there was some discussion on
            my boyfriend's part of wanting him to look like us. All
            I had to tell him was, 'I don't remember ever comparing
            penises with my dad. You don't sit around the
            Thanksgiving dinner table, haul it out and say, 'Hey,
            don't we all look alike!' "<br />
            <br />
             Stacy Nye of Redwood City agrees. She has an
            uncircumcised 8-year-old son and says the
            like-father-like-son argument is absurd. "Dr. Dean
            Edell (the talk-show host) made a good point on his
            show once when he said the penis is the last thing that
            others see to compare a father and a son, unless you
            hang out at a nudist colony."<br />
            <br />
             Even among young Jewish parents, there has been a
            change. Jonathan Marks, a Marin County real-estate
            agent, said he and his wife, Paula, did a "vast amount
            of research" when their son, Gabriel, was born five
            years ago.<br />
            <br />
             "I can't say we were torn about it. Actually, we were
            torn, but only in the expectation of others around us
            and especially my Jewish heritage. But after doing the
            research and speaking with midwives and others around
            us with boys, we decided that the trend at the time was
            moving away from this blanket circumcision edict that
            comes down from God knows where."<br />
            <br />
             "It comes up frequently in my column," Savage said.
            "Where it really creates conflict and stress for my
            readers is when they're young, hip, alternative-scene
            Jews who may not even be practicing. But suddenly
            they're having a boy, and they get all this pressure
            from their families. I know one couple who were
            disinherited, and they went ahead and didn't do the
            circumcision anyway."<br />
            <br />
             Jeff Lewis, a San Francisco optometrist who practices
            in Orinda, is Jewish and is expecting a daughter with
            his wife, Shem. If they have a boy in the future, he
            said, "We would circumcise, not only for the sake of
            tradition, but also because I've seen in hospital
            training too many elderly men go through the
            circumcision process for <a
            href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/pamphlet8.html"
            target="_blank">hygiene</a> reasons. The trauma is
            measurable."<br />
            <br />
             For a lot of parents, the notion of inflicting pain on
            their newborn son is loathsome. David Fortner of
            Berkeley, whose son Wyatt was born seven months ago,
            said, "He was such a small, little, delicate guy that
            the last thing I'd want to do was start carving up his
            little ween."<br />
            <br />
             "I'm not going to buy the argument that it's brutal,"
            Baskin said. "There's a general anesthetic involved, so
            they're not going to experience any pain, because
            they're asleep. And afterwards, with good nerve blocks,
            they basically do fine." Infants 3 to 6 months old are
            given a general anesthetic; newborns 1 to 8 days are
            given a local anesthetic.<br />
            <br />
             Baskin also dismissed the argument that circumcised
            men experience less sexual pleasure because of the loss
            of foreskin. "I think that's been pretty much debunked
            by a number of articles in the British Journal of
            Urology and the Journal of Urology." Regarding men who
            endeavor to restore their foreskin in their adult years
            -- Web sites are devoted to the practice -- Baskin
            said, "In my mind that would go under the heading, 'Get
            a life.' "<br />
            <br />
             "It's pretty hard to scientifically quantify pleasure
            under any circumstances," said retired San Francisco
            urologist Dale McGhee, "and particularly hard to
            compare pleasure quantitatively between circumcised and
            uncircumcised penises. I know that in all my career in
            medicine, I never met one man who was circumcised in
            adulthood and who said he experienced less sexual
            pleasure after than before."<br />
            <br />
             Curiously, one of the least-mentioned factors in the
            cut versus uncut debate is the <a
            href="/library/anatomy/ohara/">sexual experience of
            women</a>. "Friends who have made love to men who were
            not circumcised have told me it felt a whole lot better
            to them than men who were circumcised," said Nye. "That
            may have more to do with the skills of the man than the
            circumcision. But who knows?"<br />
