            <h2>Touch-test study finds circumcised males
            significantly less sensitive.</h2>

            <p>SEATTLE&mdash;Doctors Opposing Circumcision (DOC)
            announces the publication of a landmark study on penile
            sensitivity in the April 2007 edition of <i>BJU
            International</i>. Morris Sorrells, M. D., who serves
            on the DOC Board of Directors and Mark D. Reiss, M.D.,
            Executive Vice-President of DOC, led a team of
            physicians and other professionals in the study of
            penile sensitivity of both circumcised and
            non-circumcised men.</p>

            <p>The study, which was carried out in the San
            Francisco Bay area of California, tested 159 subject
            males with Semmes-Weinstein monofilament touch-test
            sensory evaluators..</p>

            <p>The study found that the most sensitive part of the
            penis on non-circumcised males is at the tip of the
            foreskin, an area which is always removed if a male is
            circumcised..</p>

            <p>The study also found that the glans penis in
            circumcised males is significantly less sensitive to
            fine touch than in intact males. The five most
            sensitive areas are found only on the non-circumcised
            penis..</p>

            <p>This study conclusively shows that circumcised males
            have a significant penile sensory deficit as compared
            with non-circumcised intact men..</p>

            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>,
            commented, &ldquo;This new study provided further
            evidence of the permanent and irreversible lifelong
            injury of non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision and
            raises grave ethical questions regarding the continued
            performance of child circumcision. We call upon the <a
            href="http://www.aap.org">American Academy of
            Pediatrics</a> to defend children from this
            practice.&rdquo;</p>
