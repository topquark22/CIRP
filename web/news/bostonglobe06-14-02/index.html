      <h2>Meeting draws media, protest</h2>

      <p><font size="2"><b>By Sacha Pfeiffer, Globe Staff,
      6/14/2002</b></font></p>

      <p>DALLAS - More than a dozen uniformed Dallas police
      officers stood sentry at the hotel elevators, blocking
      visitors without guest passes from reaching the rooms above.
      A dozen more officers hovered outside the hotel entrances in
      the Dallas heat - which had already reached 90 degrees by
      sunrise - monitoring the clusters of news photographers,
      television trucks, and sign-waving protesters assembled
      across the street, including one man dressed as Pope John
      Paul II and another shouting, ''Holy Pedophilia!''</p>

      <p>Inside the air-conditioned building, swarms of print,
      radio, and television reporters trailed by sweaty camera
      crews roamed the lobby, straining for a glimpse of a
      prominent cleric. Cardinal Bernard F. Law was the prize
      quarry, but his comings and goings were closely guarded, and
      sightings were rare. Access to bishops was severely limited
      by rules requiring the media to sign up in advance for
      interviews - or risk having their credentials yanked. So,
      many reporters turned their attention to victims of clergy
      sexual abuse and advocacy groups, whose frequent impromptu
      news conferences drew frenzied masses of lights, cameras, and
      microphones.</p>

      <p>Controlled mayhem characterizes the scene this week at the
      Fairmont Hotel in downtown Dallas, where more than 300
      bishops have gathered for their semiannual conference to
      debate a binding national policy on clergy sexual abuse, and
      where reporters clamor for tidbits of news in the tightly
      controlled environment like ants at a picnic.</p>

      <p>Access to bishops was severely limited by rules requiring
      the media to sign up in advance for interviews - or risk
      having their credentials yanked. So, many reporters turned
      their attention to victims of clergy sexual abuse and
      advocacy groups, whose frequent impromptu news conferences
      drew frenzied masses of lights, cameras, and microphones.</p>

      <p>Typical media attendance at the bishops' spring meetings
      numbers about 20 reporters and the event rarely attracts
      television attention, according to conference staff members
      and religion reporters who have attended the gatherings for
      years. This year, more than 750 members of the media received
      credentials to cover the meeting, including every major
      network and dozens of affiliates, and another 250 were turned
      away for lack of space. The only other church-related events
      to have drawn more media attention, conference staffers said,
      are papal visits.</p>

      <p>''We've never had this kind of media frenzy or even public
      interest,'' said Richard N. Ostling, a long-time religion
      reporter for the Associated Press and Time magazine. One of
      the few other meetings that sparked similar press interest
      was held in November 1968, shortly after the Vatican issued
      its controversial encyclical on birth control, and even that
      session drew only about 200 reporters, according to Russell
      Shaw, who was press secretary for the bishops conference from
      1969 to 1987 and now writes for <i>Our Sunday Visitor</i>, a
      Catholic magazine.</p>

      <p>The event has drawn protesters, too. Across the street
      from the hotel yesterday, where a row of tents is set up for
      television reporters to deliver live newscasts, about two
      dozen demonstrators were gathered, holding signs that read,
      ''Recovering Catholic,'' ''Homosexuality is the Cause of
      Sexual Abuse Scandal'' and <span class="yellow">''<a
      href="/library/cultural/catholic/">Stop Infant Circumcisions
      in Catholic Hospitals</a>.''</span></p>

      <p>Many of the bishops, anticipating a media mob scene,
      arrived in Dallas with their communications staffs.
      Accompanying Law were his spokeswoman, Donna M. Morrissey,
      and private secretary, the Rev. John Connolly.</p>

      <p>To accommodate the phalanx of reporters and news crews,
      the hotel's ballroom has been transformed into a pressroom
      equipped with scores of phone jacks and electrical outlets
      and a closed-circuit feed that allows reporters to watch the
      bishops from afar. The scene resembles a national political
      convention.</p>

      <p>The level of management is also considerably tighter than
      in past years. The press is barred from certain parts of the
      hotel, including floors on which the bishops are staying.
      Rules preventing reporters from speaking with bishops without
      a pre-scheduled interview, widely ignored in the past, are
      being observed. By yesterday afternoon, more than 1,000
      interview requests had been received, according to Sister
      Mary Ann Walsh, the conference's deputy director for
      communications. The press material is also more voluminous
      and sophisticated than in past years.</p>

      <p>Given the intense news coverage of the clergy sex abuse
      scandal that broke in Boston in January, the huge media
      presence isn't surprising, many observers said.</p>

      <p>''We've had six months of buildup for this meeting, and
      that's unusual, to say the least,'' said Shaw.</p>
