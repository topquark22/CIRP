            <h2>Circumcision 'often unnecessary'</h2>
            Judy Skatssoon<br />
             17feb03 

            <p>YOUNG boys might be undergoing unnecessary
            circumcisions for a condition that can be effectively
            treated with creams, according to a new study.</p>

            <p>The percentage of Australian boys being circumcised
            has fallen from 95 per cent in the 1930s to only 6.5
            per cent 20 years ago.</p>

            <p>However, a West Australian <a
            href="http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/178_04_170203/spi10278_fm.html"
             target="_blank">report</a> published today in the
            <i>Medical Journal of Australia</i> reveals a high rate
            of circumcision for phimosis, a condition where the
            foreskin cannot be retracted, in boys under five.</p>

            <p>This is despite the condition &ndash; which can
            easily be confused with normal development of the penis
            &ndash; being rare among this age group.</p>

            <p>Dr Katrina Spilsbury, of the <a
            href="http://www.uwa.edu.au/"
            target="_blank">University of Western Australia</a>'s
            <a href="http://www.publichealth.uwa.edu.au/"
            target="_blank">School of Population Health</a>,
            reviewed the circumcision of boys in the state's
            hospitals between 1981-1999.</p>

            <p>Boys aged five and under had the highest rate of
            surgery for phimosis, representing about 300
            circumcisions each year.</p>

            <p>More older boys were also being circumcised for
            phimosis, with a 70 per cent increase in the procedure
            among boys 10-14 during the period studied.</p>

            <p>"The past 19 years have seen a steady rise in the
            rate of medically indicated circumcision," Dr Spilsbury
            reports. "Most of the increase is the result of an
            increase in the rates of phimosis."</p>

            <p>Dr Spilsbury said if the current rate continued,
            about 4 per cent of boys would be circumcised for
            phimosis by the age of 15.</p>

            <p>This rate was seven times higher than the estimated
            occurrence of the condition, she said.</p>

            <p>"These findings imply a high rate of unnecessary
            surgery," writes Dr Paddy Dewan of the <a
            href="http://www.rch.org.au/rch/index.cfm?doc_id=1495">Royal
            Children's Hospital</a> in Melbourne in an <a
            href="http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/178_04_170203/dew10610_fm.html"
            target="_blank">accompanying editorial</a>.</p>

            <p>Dr Dewan suggests the high rates might be the result
            of "manipulation", either by parents who want to
            circumcise their child for cosmetic reasons or GPs who
            expect resistance from surgeons unless they give a
            medical reason for circumcision.</p>

            <p>She said phimosis could cause pain and urinary tract
            infections and was associated with sexual dysfunction
            and cancer in later life.</p>

            <p>However, there was evidence the use of steroid
            creams could reverse the situation in about four to six
            weeks.</p>

            <p>She said there might also be some confusion among
            doctors between phimosis and normal development of the
            penis in very young boys.</p>

            <p>"Our findings indicate that a review of current
            practice guidelines for the paediatric management of
            phimosis in Australia may be warranted," she
            concludes.</p>
