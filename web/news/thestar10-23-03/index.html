            <p><b>By Madoda Dyonana</b></p>

            <p>A traditional surgeon has been jailed for carrying
            out a botched and unauthorised circumcision.</p>

            <p>Eastern Cape <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/department_overview.asp?departmentID=4&amp;menuid=204&amp;mainmenuid=21"
             target="_blank">Health Department</a> spokesperson
            Sizwe Kupelo said yesterday Mphathiseni Mduka (23) was
            found guilty of circumcising an 18-year-old youth
            although he was not registered with the Health
            Department and did not have the permission of the
            youth's parents.</p>

            <p>The circumcision was botched, so the youth had to be
            taken to hospital and re-circumcised.</p>

            <p>Mduka was sentenced in the Engcobo Magistrate's
            Court to 12 months' imprisonment or a fine of R2 000.
            Sapa reported that he was unable to pay the fine and
            will remain behind bars.</p>

            <p>Eastern Cape Health MEC Dr Bevan Goqwana said: "The
            sentencing of Mduka sends a clear message that the
            government will not tolerate any contravention of the
            circumcision act in the province."</p>

            <p>Kupelo said it was the first conviction since the
            passing two years ago of the Application of Health
            Standards in Traditional Circumcision Act.</p>

            <p>Mduka was one of nine traditional surgeons arrested
            in June after 21 initiates died and 16 had to undergo
            amputations as a result of botched circumcisions, said
            Kupelo.</p>

            <p>The 18-year-old youth had been admitted to All
            Saints Hospital in Engcobo after complaining about a
            severe headache.</p>

            <p>"This initiate was observed as mentally disturbed
            and was an incomplete-circumcision case," Kupelo
            said.</p>
