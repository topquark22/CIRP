      <h2>The truth about women</h2>
      <b>A new anatomical study shows there<br />
      is more to the clitoris than anyone<br />
      ever thought. Susan Williamson and<br />
      Rachel Nowak report</b> 

      <p><b>PENIS ENVY</b> may be a thing of the past. The
      clitoris, it turns out, is no "little hill" as its derivation
      from the Greek <i>kleitoris</i> implies. Instead, it extends
      deep into the body, with a total size at least twice as large
      as most anatomy texts show, and tens of times larger than the
      average person realises, according to new studies by Helen
      O'Connell, a urology surgeon at the Royal Melbourne Hospital
      in Melbourne.</p>

      <p>The clitoris earned its Lilliputian reputation, in part,
      because much of its elaborate 3D structure is on the inside,
      hidden by fat and bone--an anatomical smoke screen that has
      helped fool lay people and experts alike. "There is a lot of
      erectile tissue down there that is not drawn in any anatomy
      textbooks, save perhaps a couple of really old dissections in
      the French and German literature." says O'Connell. "Just
      because you can't see the rest does not mean it is not
      there."</p>

      <p>Nor does it mean it is not important. O'Connell's detailed
      descriptions of female sexual anatomy could help prevent
      women who have pelvic operations from ending up with impaired
      sexual function.</p>

      <p>"The dissections are wonderful," says Cindy Amundsen, a
      gynaecologist at the University of Houston in Texas. "The
      erectile tissue is closer to the urethra and encompasses a
      far larger area of the anterior vaginal wall than most people
      thought".</p>

      <p>O'Connell first realised just how little was known about
      female sexual anatomy when she was studying for her surgical
      exams in the late 1980s. Even nowadays, she says, textbooks
      routinely recycle decades-old, inaccurate illustrations of
      female sex organs, or omit diagrams altogether. The written
      accounts can also lack a certain something. One text
      describes female genitalia as the same as the guys' only
      turned inside out; another, as the "poor homologue" of the
      male.</p>

      <p>And none of them--not even the anatomists' bible,
      <b>Gray's Anatomy</b>--describe in detail the nerves and
      blood vessels that go to the clitoris. "For a surgeon," says
      O'Connell, "that's unacceptable."</p>

      <h4>Details, details</h4>

      <p>The study of men's sexual anatomy has fared slightly
      better. Back in the 1970s, modern micro-dissection techniques
      were brought to bear on the nerves and blood vessels that
      supply the penis. The information gleaned helped spawn "nerve
      sparing" surgery that reduces the risk of impotence following
      operations for diseases like prostate or bladder cancer.</p>

      <p>Helped by John Hutson, an expert on paediatric genital
      reconstruction at the University of Melbourne, O'Connell
      hoped to do the same for women's sexual anatomy and surgery.
      But as she started to map out the nerves, she realised it
      wasn't just the fine detail that was missing from the
      textbook picture of the clitoris. "I thought, Damn! I'm not
      sure the gross anatomy is correct, either," she says.</p>

      <p>Since then O'Connell and her assistant Robert Plenter have
      dissected the bodies of 10 adult women, relying heavily on
      photography to capture the 3D structure of the clitoris. She
      has described in detail the dorsal nerves (much bigger than
      in the anatomy books) that are thought to carry the sensory
      information on the first step of its journey to the brain, as
      well as the cavernosal nerves that probably control the
      smooth muscles of the clitoris, and the size of its blood
      vessels, enabling it to swell during sex. She has also
      concluded that the clitoris as described in most textbooks is
      a mere shadow of its real self.</p>

      <p>According to O'Connell's dissections, the external tip of
      the clitoris, or glans, connects on the inside to a
      pyramid-shaped mass of erectile tissue, far larger than
      previously described. The "body" of the clitoris, which
      connects to the glans, is about as big as the first joint of
      your thumb. It has two arms up to 9 centimetres long that
      flare backwards into the body, lying just a few millimetres
      from the ends of the muscles that run up the inside of the
      thigh. Also extending from the body of the clitoris, and
      filling the space between its arm, are two bulbs, one on each
      side of the vaginal cavity.</p>

      <p>The bulbs do, in fact, make an appearance in at least some
      textbooks, but few recognise them as part of the clitoris.
      Indeed, they are usually referred to as the "bulbs of the
      vestibule"--the vestibule being the vagina. To make their
      origins clearer, O'Connell wants to rename them the "bulbs of
      the clitoris". The penis also has bulbs of erectile tissue at
      its root that extend into the body cavity, but "the bulbs are
      more prominent in females", she says.</p>

      <p><b>Gray's Anatomy</b> and other texts also claim that the
      clitoris, unlike the penis, is entirely separate from the
      urethra, the tube that connects the bladder to the outside.
      O'Connell disagrees. According to her dissections, the
      clitoris surrounds the urethra on three sides, while the
      fourth is embedded in the front wall of the vagina.</p>

      <p>That layout makes perfect sense if you think about what
      the clitoris has to do. Freud described it as a tool for
      arousing the rest of the female much as "pine shavings can be
      kindled in order to get a log of harder wood on fire". But
      the clitoris also helps squeeze the urethra shut during
      intercourse, perhaps stopping bacteria making their way up to
      the bladder and causing an infection. The engorged bulbs of
      the clitoris may also help hold the walls of the vagina
      rigid, aiding penetration.</p>

      <p>Understanding the clitoris's design, could also help
      protect women's ability to have good sex. According to
      O'Connell's descriptions, the cavernosal nerves travel
      alongside the walls of the uterus, vagina, bladder and
      urethra. And although practically nothing is known about how
      operations for, say, incontinence or bladder cancer or
      hysterectomies affect sexual function, the positions of the
      nerves suggest that it could be at risk. "Lots of operations
      involve dissections around the urethra. That could affect
      patients' sexual function," says Amundsen. Just as doctors
      routinely ask men who have had prostate surgery about their
      erections, they should ask female patients who have had
      comparable operations about any changes in their sexual
      function, she says.</p>

      <p>Now the nerves' pathways are known, it should also be
      possible to modify at least some operations to reduce the
      risk of sexual dysfunction. "There have been tons of studies
      about how to prevent impotence after radical prostectomy,"
      says John DeLancey, an expert on gynaecological anatomy at
      the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Anatomically
      speaking, a radical hysterectomy for cancer of the cervix is
      similar to a radical prostectomy. "Given this beautifully
      detailed knowledge of the interrelationship between the
      female urethra and sexual organs," it should be possible to
      develop similar nerve-sparing operations for women, he
      says.</p>

      <h4>Victorian prudes</h4>

      <p>So why have anatomists routinely got the clitoris wrong?
      Part of the problem may be a Victorian prudishness about
      examining women's sexual organs in detail. Then there's the
      fact that most of the clitoris is hidden inside, shielded by
      lots of fat and the arch of the pubic bone. Another obstacle
      to accuracy is that anatomical studies are usually done on
      the bodies of women in their 80s and 90s. Just as muscle and
      bone wither with age, so does the mass of erectile tissue in
      the clitoris. In men, shrinking erectile tissue is less of a
      problem, at least for the anatomist. More men die in
      accidents, so young bodies routinely find their way to the
      dissection table. And as the erectile tissue of the penis is
      mainly on the outside in one compact piece, it's easier to
      spot .</p>

      <p>O'Connell had two cadavers of women under forty. The older
      bodies had much smaller clitorises (although still far larger
      than in the textbooks), but once O'Connell had identified the
      erectile tissue in the younger women it was easy to find in
      the older ones. "We lucked out," she says, "one of our
      cadavers was 36 years old. She looked like an Amazon."</p>

      <p>O'Connell is now studying the cellular structure of the
      clitoris, urethra and vagina. Amundsen, meanwhile, suggests
      another topic for research: "We have Viagra. We know
      anatomically what's going on [in the clitoris]. We need some
      studies on erectile dysfunction in women."</p>
