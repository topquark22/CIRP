            <p>By Madoda Dyonana</p>

            <p><a href="" target="_blank">Health MEC Bevan
            Goqwana</a> said he would not rest until another wanted
            ingcibi (traditional surgeon) has been arrested
            following the death of an initiate in Libode in the
            Eastern Cape.</p>

            <p>The surgeon allegedly circumcised a 17-year-old
            youth who later died on arrival at St Barnabas Hospital
            as a result of complications. His name could not be
            released yesterday as the authorities were still
            locating his family.</p>

            <p>Goqwana said his department had launched a joint
            operation with police and traditional leaders to
            control the situation.</p>

            <p>"We will work hard with the team and ensure all the
            perpetrators are brought to book. We want to find out
            whether there is a third force activity which seeks to
            undermine our cultural practice," he said.</p>

            <p>Departmental spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said four other
            initiates aged 15 to 20 were likely to suffer
            amputations.</p>

            <p>The wanted ingcibi will face charges of culpable
            homicide and practicing circumcision without a
            permit.</p>

            <p>This week Queenstown police launched a hunt for
            another ingcibi wanted for the deaths of two initiates
            at Thornhill.</p>
