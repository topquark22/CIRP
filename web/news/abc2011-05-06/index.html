            <h2>Brooklyn Toddler Dies After Circumcision</h2>

            <p>(NEW YORK) -- New York City's Office of the Chief
            Medical Examiner is investigating the death of
            two-year-old Jamaal Coleson, Jr. following a
            circumcision Tuesday at Manhattan's <a
            href="http://www.wehealny.org/patients/bi_home/bi_index.html"
             target="_blank">Beth Israel Medical Center</a>.<br />
            <br />
            "They gave him anesthesia, and after the circumcision
            he woke up he was fine," said Jabbar Coleson, Jamaal
            Jr.'s uncle, who lives in Jonesboro, Ga. "He asked to
            eat, he asked for something to drink, and then he
            started complaining about pain in his stomach."<br />
            <br />
             Jabbar said his nephew was in the outpatient ward when
            doctors noticed something was wrong. But four hours
            passed before the toddler was rushed to the emergency
            room, he said. The case, which has been reported as an
            accidental death to the New York State Department of
            Health, highlights the extremely rare complications of
            the procedure performed widely throughout the United
            States.<br />
            <br />
             "Circumcision is a surgical procedure and so with that
            there are <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/">certain
            risks</a>, although the risks are quite small," said
            Dr. Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Austin, Texas, and
            author of <i>Baby 411</i>.<br />
            <br />
            The most common complications are local infections and
            bleeding, but Brown says the risks are about one in
            1,000 and one in 3,000 respectively. In infants,
            circumcision is done using local anesthesia -- a
            numbing cream or an injection into the skin. But the
            general anesthesia used for older children, like Jamaal
            Jr., can increase the risk of complications.<br />
            <br />
            "The risk is still low, but it's higher than with local
            anesthesia," Brown said, adding that in extremely rare
            cases people can be allergic to an anesthetic.<br />
            <br />
            Beth Israel Medical Center staff will conduct an
            internal review of the events the led to Jamaal Jr.'s
            death, the hospital said in a statement. A spokeswoman
            for the medical examiner's office said the cause of
            death would be released in two weeks, following
            standard tissue and toxicology tests.<br />
