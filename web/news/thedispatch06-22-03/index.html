            <h2>Circumcision: parents lay charge against
            surgeon</h2>

            <p>UMTATA (South Africa)-- Parents of a 14-year-old
            initiate from Libode have laid charges against a
            traditional surgeon who conducted an incomplete
            circumcision without their consent.</p>

            <p>When provincial Health Department spokesperson Sizwe
            Kupelo visited St Barnabas Hospital in Libode yesterday
            he was informed that the initiate's foreskin was
            incompletely cut.</p>

            <p>Nurses treated and discharged the initiate, who said
            a man known as Njini (engine) circumcised him.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said they were also looking for a surgeon
            known as Mpisi from Libode.</p>

            <p>A third surgeon known as Khonkcweni from Ngidini,
            who recently circumcised 24 boys with the same tool,
            would also be arrested, he said.</p>

            <p>"We are going to close down this circumcision
            school, because most of the boys there are under age
            and three of them had septic circumcisions. They were
            treated and discharged."</p>

            <p>They were also looking for an unknown Mdantsane man
            who circumcised boys recently.</p>

            <p>None of these surgeons were registered.</p>

            <p>St. Barnabas Hospital records showed that this
            season nine boys were circumcised in a safe Western
            method at the hospital. All have been discharged.</p>

            <p>Kupelo yesterday proceeded to the Umtata General
            Hospital, where four initiates have been admitted since
            Monday from the Sibangweni administrative area, near
            Libode. <span class="yellow">Traditional nurses
            allegedly assaulted these initiates and the community
            decided to close down the initiation school,</span>
            Kupelo said.</p>

            <p>The hospital's records showed 11 initiates have been
            treated since the start of this season.</p>

            <p>"We have already arrested a traditional surgeon
            known as S. Mtwa from Etyeni, near Tsolo for
            circumcising boys without their parents' consent,"
            Kupelo said.</p>

            <p>The department was trying to arrange a meeting with
            the village chief after officials received death
            threats from residents in Mfabantu, near Tsolo.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said the matter had been reported to the
            police.</p>
