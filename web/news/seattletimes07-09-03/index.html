            <h2>The circumcision decision: Merits of procedure
            debated</h2>

            <p><i>Over the past 20 years, rates of hospital
            circumcision have fallen steadily in Western states, as
            doctors and parents debate the procedure's medical and
            cultural significance.</i></p>

            <p>By <a href="mailto:costrom@seattletimes.com">Carol
            M. Ostrom</a><br />
             <i>Seattle Times staff reporter</i></p>
            <img border="0" bordercolor="#000000" height="136"
            src="gomco.jpg" width="200" align="right" vspace="20"
            hspace="20" alt="Gomco clamp" /> 

            <p>The pictures were eye-catching but hard to look at:
            baby boys strapped down, surgical drapes across their
            middles revealing teeny, tiny penises clamped into
            metal vises, awaiting a few fateful minutes with the
            knife.</p>

            <p>Are you squirming a bit? That's just fine with
            anti-circumcision protesters, who gathered recently
            with their photos and banners outside the <a
            href="http://www.wsctc.com/">Washington State
            Convention &amp; Trade Center</a>, hoping to change
            hearts and minds among hundreds of pediatricians
            gathered for an annual meeting.</p>

            <p>"It's barbaric," said protester John Mark, a former
            public-health worker and founder of CIRC, the
            Circumcision Information Resource Center of Washington,
            who was busily buttonholing passersby.</p>

            <p>"We should protect every part of a child, from head
            to toe and everywhere in between&#8212;from our point
            of view, especially <i>in between</i>."</p>

            <p>Once upon a time, the decision to circumcise a
            newborn boy barely warranted discussion between new
            parents and their obstetrician, pediatrician or family
            doctor. "Of course," was the answer to the doctor's
            virtually rhetorical question about the procedure,
            which removes the skin covering the head of the penis,
            called the foreskin.</p>

            <p>Parents assumed there were good reasons to do it,
            and doctors assumed parents wanted it done. Although
            statistics are spotty, by the mid-20th century the
            practice was widespread. By 1979, says one researcher,
            as many as 85 percent of baby boys in the U.S. were
            being circumcised. In Western states, according to
            federal statistics, nearly 64 percent of boys born at
            hospitals were circumcised.</p>

            <p>In those years, parents or doctors sometimes made
            vague references to supposed health benefits, but
            details probably were not discussed. Often, parents
            simply said they wanted their newborn boy to look like
            "the other kids," or like Dad.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Today, it's not as clear as it
            once was what the other kids, or even Dad, if he's
            young enough, will look like.</span></p>
            Over the past 20 years, rates of circumcision have
            fallen steadily in Western states. In 1999, although
            national rates hovered around 60 percent, according to
            the National Center for Health Statistics, less than 37
            percent of boys born in hospitals in Western states
            were circumcised.<br />
            <br />
             

            <p><span class="yellow">"I tell people, at least in my
            community, that if their son was in high school and
            pulled his pants down in the locker room and was
            uncircumcised, it would be no big deal,"</span> says
            Dr. Mitch Weinberg, a pediatrician and president of the
            medical staff at <a
            href="http://evergreenhealthcare.org/showpage.asp"
            target="_blank">Evergreen Hospital Medical Center</a>
            in Kirkland. <span class="yellow">"Twenty years ago
            that wouldn't have been the case."</span></p>

            <p>These days, Weinberg, like many doctors, is careful
            to go over the pros and cons with prospective parents.
            "I think it's a parent's choice to decide," he said.
            <span class="yellow">"It is not a medically necessary
            procedure."</span></p>

            <p>Dr. Steven Woods, chief of the obstetrics-gynecology
            department at <a
            href="http://www.overlakehospital.org/"
            target="_blank">Overlake Medical Center</a>, agrees. On
            the other hand, he says, "It's not butchery."</p>

            <p>In 2000, <a href="http://www.ghc.org/"
            target="_blank">Group Health Cooperative</a>, which had
            not covered routine circumcision since the late 1980s,
            resumed coverage in health policies after merging with
            Group Health Northwest, based in Spokane. Many parents
            asked for it, and doctors were divided about the
            procedure's value, said Group Health spokeswoman Lee
            Tucker Therriault.</p>

            <p>Considering that circumcision is a procedure that's
            been around for centuries&#8212;the first recorded
            account appears to be about 2400 B.C., from an Egyptian
            hieroglyph&#8212;some might think it's odd that once
            again, it's become controversial.</p>
            But in many ways, patients are making more decisions
            about medical care that was once taken for granted. And
            many doctors, wary of regaining that old
            "paternalistic" label, are trying harder to present
            balanced information to help new parents sort out the
            choices, rather than just giving them their opinions.
            And in the past few years, anti-circumcision groups
            have gained new momentum.<br />
            <br />
             

            <p><span class="yellow">Lawsuits over technically
            flawless circumcisions on babies may signal even more
            change on the horizon.</span> One was filed by an adult
            man who claimed he was sexually desensitized without
            his consent, the others by parents who said they
            weren't fully informed about the procedure.</p>

            <p>For some parents, circumcision isn't really a
            choice: It's dictated by their religion, or there are
            specific medical indications for the procedure.</p>

            <p>For most parents, though, the decision they face is
            about routine neonatal circumcision. For many, it's a
            decision that requires more analysis than it did for
            their parents.</p>

            <p><b>Making the decision</b></p>

            <p>Lon Vaughn and his wife, Jennifer, were divided. She
            was of the "if it's natural, leave it alone" view, he
            said. But Lon prevailed, he said, because he'd once
            been a boy in gym class and knew how important it was
            to be "normal."</p>

            <p>"It's hard enough for a kid to grow up," says
            Vaughn, a small-business owner who lives in Ballard.
            The last thing you want, he says, is to "draw attention
            to your genitalia." Being laughed at, he thinks, could
            scar a boy for life.</p>

            <p>Vaughn figures that his son, due next month, will
            mostly see circumcised men in pictures, or in real
            life. On the other hand, an uncircumcised friend opted
            against the procedure for his baby. For both of them,
            he realized, it was important that their sons look like
            their dads.</p>

            <p>Katlyne Mobasher, an Edmonds mom, decided against it
            for her son, now 13, after reading about circumcision
            when she was pregnant. "The whole thought of it didn't
            seem like a very nice thing to do to a baby," she said.
            After all, she'd strongly disagreed when a friend had
            docked her dogs' ears and tails&#8212;for no good
            reason, she thought at the time.</p>
            She learned that the vast majority of men in
            Scandinavian countries aren't circumcised, and seemed
            to be healthy and strong, said Mobasher. And the "look
            like Dad" argument didn't impress her either: "If your
            husband was missing an arm, would you chop off your
            baby's arm?"<br />
            <br />
             

            <p><b>Benefits vs. risks</b></p>
            In 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics took a <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/">long
            look</a> at the evidence and concluded the potential
            benefits of circumcision, weighed against risks,
            weren't significant enough to recommend it as a routine
            procedure. They stopped short of advising against it,
            but recommended that parents weigh potential benefits
            and risks, as well as cultural and religious
            traditions.<br />
            <br />
             

            <p>In many other countries, circumcision is much less
            common, and health insurance doesn't routinely pay for
            it. In <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statistics/Canada/">Canada</a>,
            for example, estimates place the rate of circumcision
            at 20 percent or less.</p>
            Potential benefits, says Dr. Monja Proctor, a pediatric
            surgeon with Swedish Pediatric Specialty Care, are
            thought to be decreased incidence of urinary-tract
            infections and penile cancer, a very rare disease in
            men. Circumcision also may help protect men from
            getting and spreading sexually transmitted diseases,
            including AIDS, although the pediatrics academy
            statement calls that evidence "complex and
            conflicting."<br />
            <br />
             On the other hand, there are real risks, including
            what Proctor calls "acute, significant complications."
            Bleeding and infection may range from mild to severe.
            Other complications may not show up until much later,
            including scarring or stricture of the opening of the
            urethra.<br />
            <br />
             

            <p>Although most studies show that serious
            complications are very rare, John Geisheker, a local
            lawyer, says he now has several "botched-circumcision
            clients," and that a pediatric urologist he consults
            told him he sees three such cases every day.</p>

            <p>Ranging from very mild to severe, <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/williams-kapila/">
            complications</a> may reach as high as 3 to 4 percent,
            Proctor estimates. Weinberg puts the risk of
            complications lower, probably under 1 percent, while
            anti-circumcision forces often use higher
            estimates.</p>
            Proctor believes most of the touted benefits can be
            achieved other ways&#8212;through proper hygiene and,
            in the case of urinary-tract infections, antibiotics.
            As for the supposed protection from sexually
            transmitted diseases conferred by a circumcision, <span
            class="yellow">Proctor says it doesn't stack up against
            safe sex.</span><br />
            <br />
             

            <p>"I don't try to scare parents, but you're doing
            essentially an elective procedure with very few
            definite indications, and it has some potential real
            risks," says Proctor. "Putting a child through
            circumcision because you say you're decreasing the
            chances of a sexually transmitted disease is, I think,
            a very poor indication."</p>

            <p>Other cosmetic procedures are done to fix
            abnormalities, she says. <span class="yellow">"But this
            is not an abnormality."</span></p>
            Like many doctors these days, though, Proctor believes
            it's the parents' right to decide.<br />
            <br />
             

            <p>"There's not a right or a wrong answer," she says.
            "I think it's important to consider what the risks are,
            and what the reasons are they're proceeding with a
            circumcision."</p>

            <p>Dr. Jeffery Thompson, chief medical officer for the
            state's <a href="http://www.wa.gov/dshs/"
            target="_blank">Department of Social and Health
            Services</a>, points out information about circumcision
            made available to doctors by <a
            href="http://www.mdconsult.com/" target="_blank">MD
            Consult Clinical Knowledge System</a>, an online
            service.</p>

            <p>"The foreskin on the penis is not some cosmic
            error," says the fact sheet. <span class="yellow">The
            foreskin, the fact sheet continues, protects the top of
            the baby's penis from urine, feces and other
            irritation, lessens the chance of infection or scarring
            of the urinary opening, and helps preserve the
            sensitivity of the glans, the top of the
            penis.</span></p>

            <p>On the other hand, it notes the sensitivity of
            adolescent boys to looking like everyone else: "It can
            be emotionally painful to be a trailblazer about the
            appearance of one's genitals."</p>

            <p>At Evergreen, Weinberg says he tells parents that
            research shows it's not necessary for kids to look like
            their fathers, but once you make a choice, stick to it
            for siblings. "Little brothers pull their pants down,
            and they want to look alike."</p>

            <p><b>Rates vary by hospital</b></p>

            <p>There are huge variations in circumcision rates by
            country and by region, and even by hospital, Weinberg
            notes. At <a href="http://www.overlakehospital.org/"
            target="_blank">Overlake Hospital</a> in Bellevue,
            hospital figures for 2002 show two-thirds of baby boys
            born there were circumcised; at Swedish Medical
            Center's First Hill and Ballard hospitals, the rate is
            about 56 percent, including babies circumcised later at
            doctors' offices. Some observers believe the West's
            lower statistics may reflect ethnic differences; for
            example, California has an increasing proportion of
            Hispanics, who historically have been less likely to
            choose circumcision.</p>

            <p>The numbers also may reflect that California, like
            Washington, has not covered routine circumcision with
            Medicaid, the joint state-federal health-insurance
            program, for many years.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">It's not clear yet what effect
            the lawsuits may have on numbers of
            circumcisions.</span> One suit, by the parents of a
            North Dakota boy who said a Fargo doctor didn't inform
            them of the risks, is on appeal after being rejected by
            a jury.</p>

            <p>Another, by a 21-year-old Virginia man, William
            Stowell, targeted the <a
            href="http://www.webspan.net/~goodsam/GoodSamHosp.html"
            target="_blank">hospital</a> where he was born.</p>

            <p>Stowell, who received an undisclosed amount of money
            in settlement, said his foreskin was wrongly removed,
            sexually desensitizing him without his consent. He
            believes doctors shouldn't do circumcisions, even if
            parents ask them to.</p>

            <p>"Common sense should dictate you shouldn't perform
            life-altering surgery on someone for no medical
            reason," said Stowell, reached last month at an
            anti-circumcision group's strategy meeting in San
            Francisco. "You don't perform cosmetic surgery on your
            child to make him look like you."</p>

            <p>Stowell says his lawsuit should send a stab of fear
            into doctors who do circumcisions. "I was circumcised
            in 1981. It was 18 years before they heard from me
            again," he says. "The doctor could be living the high
            life in retirement" when an angry patient appears with
            a lawsuit.</p>

            <p>Geisheker, the attorney, sees the lawsuits as the
            leading edge of a movement. Parents, Geisheker
            believes, depend on the goodwill and honesty of doctors
            to guide them. They shouldn't have to "spend evenings
            reading urology texts to protect their child from
            medical overreaching," he says.</p>

            <p>Proctor predicts the trend will be toward fewer
            circumcisions as parents realize there is no medical
            justification. "Then there will be less of a cultural
            tendency to do it."</p>

            <p>Doctors, too, are changing in their views, says Dr.
            George Denniston, a retired UW family practitioner and
            tirelessly campaigning president of DOC (Doctors
            Opposing Circumcision).</p>

            <p>Denniston, co-author of "Doctors Re-examine
            Circumcision," says that's evidenced by doctors'
            attitudes toward anti-circumcision protesters. "In the
            old days, they'd come up and say 'Get a life!' Now,
            they can't do that&#8212;they can't trivialize it."</p>
