        <h2>FAMILY GETS $2.75 MILLION IN WRONGFUL SURGERY SUIT</h2>

        <p>by Vincent Lupo<br />
         American Press Staff Writer</p>
      </center>

      <p>The family of a young boy, whose penis had to be amputated
      after it was severely burned during a <span
      class="yellow">routine</span> circumcision performed at a
      state-run hospital, was awarded $2.75 million by a jury in
      14th Judicial District Court.</p>

      <p class="cirp">[CIRP Comment: A <i>routine</i> circumcision,
      by definition, is an unnecessary, non-therapeutic
      circumcision that is performed in the absence of medical
      indication. The lack of necessity for the surgery makes this
      case all the more tragic.]</p>

      <p>Jurors made the award against the State of Louisiana <a
      href="http://www.dhh.state.la.us/" target="_blank">Department
      of Health and Human Resources</a> (DHHR) and the <a
      href="http://www.lsuhsc.edu/hcsd/" target="_blank">LSU Board
      of Supervisors</a>. The family of the boy asked that they not
      be named.</p>

      <p>According to testimony during the week-long civil trial
      before Judge L. E. Hawsey Jr., the boy who was 2 years old at
      the time, was to undergo a routine circumcision at W. O. Moss
      Regional Hospital on February 2, 1984.</p>

      <p>A third-year surgical resident undergoing training through
      the LSU medical program supervised the operation in which an
      electrosurgical instrument manufactured by Valley Lab of
      Boulder, Colo., was used. The device, commonly used to stop
      bleeding during surgery, can cut tissue through heat
      transmitted by an electric current.</p>

      <p>During the surgery which was actually performed by another
      resident under the supervision of the surgical resident,
      <span class="yellow">the boy's penis was severely
      burned.</span> Internal damage to blood vessels apparently
      also occurred and kept vital oxygen from reaching the tissue
      of the organ, which had to be removed later after the child
      was transferred to a New Orleans hospital.</p>

      <p>Doctors in New Orleans strongly suggested that the parents
      allow them to perform a sex change operation on the toddler,
      but they refused. <span class="yellow">The boy's urinary
      tract was rerouted during several subsequent surgeries both
      here and in New Orleans, and he now urinates through a hole
      located where his penis had been.</span></p>

      <p>His parents sued the state and Valley Lab. Neither doctor
      was named as a defendant. The family claimed the manufacturer
      of the surgical device failed to adequately warn doctors of
      the harm which could be caused by the instrument.</p>

      <p>The trial was bifurcated which means a portion was decided
      by Judge Hawsey and portion was decided by the jurors.
      Because juries are composed of citizens of the state, jurors
      are not allowed to decide any suit or part of a suit naming a
      state agency as defendant.</p>

      <p>Therefore Judge Hawsey determined the liability of the
      state, while the jurors decided the liability of Valley
      Lab.</p>

      <p>While jurors deleberated on their verdict, Judge Hawsey
      rendered his decision against the state. He found both DHHR
      and the LSU Board of Supervisors liable in the case.</p>

      <p>The judge awarded a total of $18,969 in special damages to
      the boys parents for medical expenses and $100,000 in general
      damages, ande $1.73 million to the victim.</p>

      <p>In his oral ruling, Judge Hawsey said he felt Valley Labs
      was not negligent in providing warnings about the surgical
      instrument.</p>

      <p>Jurors, however disagreed and determined Valley Lab was 30
      percent responsible for the injuries to the child.</p>

      <p>The juries awarded the boy a total of $2.75 million.</p>

      <p>Local attorney David A. Fraser, who represented the
      family, said the higher figure awarded by the jury is
      considered the amount of the judgement.</p>

      <p>Since the state has a $500,000 limit stipulated by state
      law regarding its insurance coverage, Valley Lab apparently
      must assume the payment of the remainder. However, Valley Lab
      can attempt to recover 70 percent of that remainder since
      jurors found that defendant only 30 percent liable, Fraser
      said.</p>

      <p>The attorney said he feels certain the defendants will
      appeal the decisions to higher courts.</p>
