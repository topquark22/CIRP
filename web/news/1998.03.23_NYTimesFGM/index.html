      Rite (Oct. 12, 1996)</a> 

      <p><b>By BARBARA CROSSETTE</b></p>

      <p>More than 160,000 girls and women in immigrant communities
      in the United States may have been victims of the traditional
      practice of genital mutilation or are at risk of being
      subjected to it, according to a report to be published Monday
      by a New York State congresswoman active in a campaign to
      prosecute practitioners.</p>

      <p>The estimate -- extrapolated from the 1990 census -- does
      not distinguish between those on whom the operation has been
      performed and those who are deemed at risk.</p>

      <p>Information is only beginning to be collected on the
      prevalence of the operation to remove all or part of the
      female genital area, a practice most common among immigrants
      from Africa. It has been illegal in the United States since
      1997. Much evidence is anecdotal, but public health officials
      say there is enough to cause concern.</p>

      <p>In January, Rep. Louise M. Slaughter, D-N.Y., asked the
      Health and Human Services Department to survey the situation.
      The department based its report on a statistical analysis by
      the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
      Atlanta.</p>

      <p>Officials say precise figures are difficult to collect
      because the only sure medical measurement of the practice is
      physical examination. But doctors and women's groups in
      immigrant communities are accumulating enough accounts to
      cause concern in Congress and the administration.</p>

      <p>Donna Shalala, secretary of <a
      href="http://www.os.dhhs.gov/" target="_blank">Health and
      Human Services</a>, has been developing educational material
      for health professionals encountering the problem for the
      first time.</p>

      <p>"It's illegal, it's inhumane and we've got to be clear
      about that," Ms. Shalala said. "At the same time, we have to
      be culturally sensitive in explaining to those immigrants who
      might put their girls at risk that the practice has harmful
      physical and psychological consequences."</p>

      <p>The practice, which women's groups call female genital
      mutilation, affects about 100 million women worldwide,
      international health experts say. It may involve the removal
      of only the clitoris or all of the external genitalia.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.oms.ch/" target="_blank">World
      Health Organization</a> says the practice often includes
      infibulation, in which the vagina is sewn shut to prevent the
      woman from having sexual relations with anyone but her
      husband. Infections and perpetual leakage of urine are among
      the side effects. Many girls die of bleeding or shock.</p>

      <p>David Smith, associate director of the office of
      international and refugee health at the Department of Health
      and Human Services, said: "The issue is not simply new
      surgeries. There are lifelong medical consequences as a
      result of these surgeries that have to be attended to."</p>

      <p>Ms. Slaughter said she was disturbed by arguments that
      this is an acceptable cultural practice.</p>

      <p>"I appreciate that a lot of people are very sensitive to
      the cultural notion that this is something done in other
      places, but we don't do it here any more than we would let a
      group put chastity belts on little girls over 11," she said
      in an interview.</p>

      <p>At <a href="http://www.equalitynow.org/"
      target="_blank">Equality Now</a>, a women's human rights
      organization in New York that works extensively with
      immigrants, Jessica Neuwirth, the director, said that to
      avoid cultural clashes over the issue, "there is a strong
      feeling that the movement against this must be led by African
      activists."</p>

      <p>Experts say it is too early to determine whether the
      practice, now under attack in Africa, will die in the United
      States as immigrants move into mainstream society.</p>

      <p>But Ms. Neuwirth, who receives letters from African women
      here asking for help in combating the rite here, says she has
      heard accounts of operations done by immigrants themselves or
      by foreign practitioners who perform the cutting either in
      the ancestral country or in the United States at the
      invitation of families seeking to evade the law.</p>

      <p>A number of African countries have curtailed the practice
      or are advising against it. In a landmark ruling last year,
      Egypt's highest court not only banned the practice but also
      ruled against Muslims who advocate it by declaring in the
      decision that there is nothing in the Koran or Islamic law
      that prescribes or condones the operation.</p>
