            <h2>45 initiates have died in botched
            circumcisions</h2>

            <p>BISHO -- A total of 45 initiates have died as a
            result of circumcision-related practices so far this
            year.</p>

            <p>The death toll is the highest since the <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/structure/department/health2/overview.htm"
             target="_blank">Health Department</a> started
            recording initiates' deaths in 1995.</p>

            <p>The department recorded 41 deaths in 1995. This
            year's fatalities included 33 in the June season and 12
            in the present season so far.</p>

            <p>At least 68 initiates have been admitted to
            hospitals around the province during the
            December/November initiation period.</p>

            <p>The Spethu Hospital in Ntabankulu topped the list of
            admittances, with 35 initiates referred there. Two of
            these patients are in a critical condition. Another
            initiate is in a critical condition in the intensive
            care unit at the Umtata General Hospital.</p>

            <p>The police have arrested seven people following the
            deaths. They have been deemed to be in contravention of
            the Application to Health Standard Act, which enforces
            proper initiation processes.</p>

            <p>On Sunday police in Ntabethemba arrested six people
            in connection with murder and contravening the Act.</p>

            <p><span>Three of the six suspects will be charged with
            the murder and assault of a 17-year-old initiate from
            Saaiplaas near Tarkastad.</span></p>

            <p>The three suspects -- the 65-year-old father of the
            boy, the boy's 24-year-old brother and a 55-year-old
            man -- will appear in court today.</p>

            <p>The remaining three charged with violating the Act
            include a 65-year-old traditional surgeon.</p>

            <p>In Qweqwe, not far from Qunu, a traditional surgeon
            was arrested for carrying out initiation rites under
            the influence of alcohol.</p>

            <p>The head if the Health Department, <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/structure/profile/stamper.htm"
             target="_blank">Dr Siphiwo Stamper</a>, urged the
            community to co-operate with health officials and
            police in reporting circumcision malpractices.</p>

            <p>He said the community should "participate strongly"
            because they know when things go wrong.</p>

            <p>"This fights needs the co-operation of the community
            and we will not conquer without them.</p>

            <p>"They must be the whistle-blower as they are there
            ones who see these things."</p>

            <p>Stamper emphasised that people should "tell the
            truth" about an incident rather than hide the real
            causes.</p>

            <p>Stamper noted that co-ordination among traditional
            leaders, nurses and surgeons, the community and the
            department was "bearing fruit".</p>

            <p>He said it was the community who had a duty to
            choose the "right" people to perform the rite. --
