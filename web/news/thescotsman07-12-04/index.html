            <h2>Doctors Accused over Circumcisions</h2>
            <i>By Nick Foley, PA News</i> 

            <p>Two experienced doctors admitted carrying out <a
            href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/standards/circum.htm"
            target="_blank">circumcisions</a> on two baby boys
            without the parents' written <a
            href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/standards/consent.htm"
            target="_blank">consent</a>, but denied causing them
            unnecessary pain, the <a href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/"
            target="_blank">General Medical Council</a> heard
            today.</p>

            <p>Dr Virinder Madhok and Dr Ayyaswany Vasanthakrishnan
            also admitted failing to inform the babies' parents
            about the <a
            href="/library/complications/williams-kapila/">risks</a>
            involved in the procedure, during the hearing in
            Manchester.</p>

            <p>The GMC heard that the two babies, referred to only
            as Master A and Master B, had been taken to Dr Madhok's
            private surgery in Battlefield Road, Glasgow, to have
            the circumcisions performed in accordance with Muslim
            tradition.</p>

            <p>Opening the case for the GMC, Nick Braslavsky QC,
            said that eight-month-old Master A was taken to the
            surgery on July 6, 2002 by his mother and aunt.</p>

            <p>As the family waited to be seen by the doctor they
            saw another boy who had just been circumcised return to
            his family.</p>

            <p>His body and legs were covered in blood, he was
            sweating and in a distressed state, Master A's aunt
            told the hearing.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">"He was just crying and crying
            and just wouldn't stop. He was covered in blood, it got
            me quite scared," she said.</span></p>

            <p>She told the GMC that she noticed Dr Madhok's hands
            were also covered in blood and he was not wearing
            gloves.</p>

            <p>The doctor handed back the baby to its parents,
            telling them he was a "stubborn child who would cause
            them a lot of problems in the future".</p>

            <p>When Aunt A intervened and pointed out he was only a
            baby, Dr Madhok replied: "I don't need a lecture from
            you. I've been doing this for 52 years," she said.</p>

            <p>Baby A was then taken away for just under an hour
            for the surgery.</p>

            <p>Dr Madhok and Dr Vasanthakrishnan, who was
            performing the surgery, both admitted they failed to
            get written consent from the mother or explain that the
            procedure was to be performed by Dr Vasanthakrishnan,
            who in fact was never introduced to the family
            members.</p>

            <p>When Master A was returned he was covered in blood,
            sweating and had scratches on his arms and stomach, his
            aunt said.</p>

            <p>Dr Madhok explained that the scratches had been
            caused by his fingernails during the circumcision.</p>

            <p>"I felt quite angry that this had happened, he was a
            doctor. I was quite angry and shocked," she said.</p>

            <p>She told the hearing that she did not believe the
            scratches had been caused by the doctor's
            fingernails.</p>

            <p>The worried aunt and mother later took the boy to
            hospital, fearing the blood on the doctor's hands could
            have infected the child.</p>

            <p>Tests were carried out on the boy, which proved
            negative.</p>

            <p>The GMC also heard that the four-month-old boy,
            referred to as Master B, was taken to the same surgery
            for circumcision on October 26, 2002.</p>

            <p>The doctors again failed to explain the risks
            involved in the procedure and failed to gain either the
            aunt or mother's written consent.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">The boy was returned to them in
            a "very distressed state" and could be heard screaming
            from the waiting room as the procedure was performed,
            Mr Braslavsky said.</span><br />
            </p>

            <p>Dr Madhok, of Dalziel Drive, Glasgow, suggested that
            he had not been anaesthetised properly or at all during
            the surgery, it was claimed.</p>

            <p>The doctors were also accused of permitting sutures
            to be inappropriately inserted into the glans (end) of
            the penis.</p>

            <p>Both claims were denied by the GPs who were both
            present at the hearing.</p>
