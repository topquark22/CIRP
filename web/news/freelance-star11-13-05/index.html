            <h4>Doctor says routine circumcision of baby boys is
            wrong</h4>

            <p>Date published: 11/13/2005</p>

            <p>FOR THOSE OF YOU who read my last column and the
            letters to the editor that followed, you already know
            that my comments about anti-circumcision demonstrators
            at the recent <a href="http://www.aap.org"
            target="_blank">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>
            meeting in D.C. were not well received.</p>

            <p>My column was about SIDS prevention, but I slipped
            in a little joke about the demonstrators being mostly
            "graying hippies" and having bumper stickers like, "Not
            Circumcised? You Lucky Stiff!"</p>

            <p>While I was trying to be funny, and make light of
            the controversy at our conference, I apparently
            offended people all over the U.S. and Canada. And all
            this for a column that wasn't even about circumcision.
            Obviously, people feel very strongly about this
            issue.</p>

            <p>The funny thing is, I agree with the demonstrators.
            I don't think circumcision should be routinely
            performed on newborns.</p>

            <p>I don't do circumcisions. I was trained to, and had
            to do them while still in the Navy. But in our area,
            unlike where I trained in California, Ob/Gyn doctors
            perform most circumcisions. Even if they didn't, I
            still would not perform them.</p>

            <p>Like the demonstrators, I believe that removing a
            healthy body part for cosmetic reasons is not
            appropriate. Well, let me rephrase that, because I have
            no problem at all with liposuction in a consenting
            adult. But in most cases of neonatal circumcision,
            we're talking about a helpless newborn losing a very
            sensitive part of the body for no good medical reason.
            Certainly there are religious reasons for some
            families--more on that later.</p>

            <p>In the U.S., most people who choose to circumcise
            their newborns do it so that the penis looks "normal"
            and so that it will be cleaner. Neither of these
            reasons is valid. Isn't the "normal" penis the one that
            God created? Whatever happened to, "If it ain't broke,
            don't fix it?" In fact, 80 percent to 85 percent of the
            world's male population is not circumcised. So that is
            more "normal."</p>

            <p>I hear fathers say they worry that if their son does
            not have it done, he'll wonder why he doesn't look like
            his dad. Well, that is just as easy to explain as
            questions like, "Dad, why do you have hair there and I
            don't?" Or, "Dad, why do you have blue eyes and I have
            brown eyes?"</p>

            <p>Hygiene is also a nonissue for most people. There
            are rare cases, like soldiers out in the field for days
            and days without bathing, in which the uncircumcised
            penis is more prone to infection. But in most cases,
            boys who are "uncut" learn to care for their penises
            just like they learn to brush and floss their teeth,
            and it's no big deal.</p>

            <p>Let me mention that there are religious reasons for
            circumcision in the Jewish and Islamic faiths. I
            consider that to be very different than the routine
            circumcision done just because everybody else is doing
            it.</p>

            <p>In the Old Testament, circumcision is described as a
            symbolic act by which a Jewish male enters into a
            covenant with God. This is a long-standing tradition,
            and the bris ceremony is very important in the Jewish
            faith. However, I have learned that the practice is
            beginning to be questioned by many Jews (see <a
            href="http://www.jewishcircumcision.org"
            target="_blank">jewishcircumcision.org</a>).</p>

            <p>It is unclear why Christians took up the practice,
            or why it occurs more in the U.S. than any other
            country in the world. There are Christian organizations
            such as Catholics against Circumcision (<a
            href="http://www.catholicsagainstcircumcision.org"
            target="_blank">catholicsagainstcircumcision.org</a>)
            which state that the New Testament has passages that
            recommend against the practice.</p>

            <p>Several resources I read mentioned that the practice
            became more widespread in the late 1800s in the U.S.,
            and was touted as a way to cure masturbation (which was
            thought at the time to cause insanity, blindness and
            all sorts of horrible things). The circumcised penis is
            certainly less sensitive, due to the loss of a ring of
            tissue near the tip of the foreskin, which is the most
            sensitive part of the penis. But, I'm not really seeing
            that this was a cure.</p>

            <p>Anyway, routine circumcision goes on in many areas,
            despite the fact that the American Academy of
            Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Practitioners,
            and the American Medical Association have all published
            statements that do not support routine neonatal
            circumcision. These are echoed by medical organizations
            all over the world, including the <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aaps/"
            target="_blank">Australian Association of Paediatric
            Surgeons</a>, which put it like this: "We do not
            support the removal of a normal part of the body,
            unless there are definite indications to justify the
            complications and risks which may arise."</p>

            <p>As the American Academy of Pediatrics notes in its
            position statement, there are potential medical
            benefits, but they are minimal and do not outweigh the
            risks. (You can read the statement online at <a
            href="http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;103/3/686"
             target="_blank">aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;103/3/686</a>).</p>

            <p>There are definitely fewer urinary tract infections
            in male infants under 1 year of age who are
            circumcised. However, fewer than 1 percent of
            uncircumcised baby boys get UTIs, so the increased risk
            is still pretty minimal. The same goes for the
            increased risk of penile cancer in uncircumcised men.
            There is a slightly increased risk, but this cancer is
            quite rare.</p>

            <p>Potential complications of circumcision are more
            likely and include bleeding, poor cosmetic results,
            adhesions (I see a lot of those), scarring of the
            urethral opening, infection, and very rarely, penile
            amputation or death.</p>

            <p>Then there is another issue I never thought about
            until I started researching this article. In the U.S.,
            1.2 million circumcisions are performed each year, yet
            this is considered a medically unnecessary procedure.
            The cost adds up to somewhere between $150 million to
            $270 million per year. Just think of how that money
            could be better spent!</p>

            <p>In Virginia, Medicaid still pays for circumcisions.
            If that money was saved, it could pay for many of the
            infant's immunizations, for example. Several states,
            including California, Arizona, Florida, Washington and
            Oregon, already have disallowed Medicaid coverage of
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>Having to pay $100 upfront to be circumcised was
            certainly a big deterrent at my last practice in
            California. In California, circumcision is in the
            minority--approximately 33 percent of newborns are
            having it done. In Virginia, it is still more
            widespread than that, but seems to be decreasing in
            popularity. (Exact numbers are difficult to come by,
            but I think we are in the range of 75 percent).</p>

            <p>It seems like I end almost every column this way: Be
            informed. Know the risks and benefits before you
            decide. If you choose to have the surgery performed on
            your newborn, be sure that analgesia is used. Lidocaine
            injected into the base of the penis is very helpful in
            reducing pain during the procedure. Also, giving the
            baby sugar on a pacifier decreases their pain
            response.</p>

            <p>Hard to believe, but even a few years ago it was
            routine practice not to use any analgesia or anesthesia
            for newborns being circumcised.</p>

            <p>Now, it's considered the standard of care.</p>

            <p>If you choose not to circumcise your son, you don't
            need to do anything special to care for the penis--just
            normal bathing. Do not try to retract the foreskin!
            This should not be done until years later, and will
            happen naturally with time. For more information on
            care of the intact penis, see <a
