            <h2>Another boy dies after circumcision</h2>
            <i>2 July 2008</i> 

            <p>The number of winter circumcision fatalities in the
            Eastern Cape has risen to 15 following the death of
            another youth in the Libode area of Transkei, the
            provincial health department said on Wednesday.<br />
            <br />
             Spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said the latest death
            followed an attempt by parents to frustrate the
            department's efforts to clamp down on an illegal
            initiation school.<br />
            <br />
             He said police and health officials went to the site
            of the school at Gxulu village in the early hours of
            Saturday morning when one youth died there.<br />
            <br />
             They found the site deserted, and community members
            assured them that all the remaining boys had been taken
            away by their parents and were safe.<br />
            <br />
             However, Kupelo said, it appeared that they merely
            re-established the school at a different site.<br />
            <br />
             A second boy died at the new site on Tuesday
            afternoon.<br />
            <br />
             "This is unacceptable," he said. "People must
            understand these deaths happen at illegal schools
            because the whole thing is not properly
            organised."<br />
            <br />
             Kupelo said autopsies had not yet been carried out,
            but the usual causes of initiate deaths were gangrene
            from septic wounds, or dehydration.<br />
            <br />
             He said the department was disturbed by the growing
            tendency for parents to try to treat initiates' health
            problems at home.<br />
            <br />
             "It is important for people to raise the alarm with
            the department because we have the skill, we have the
            capacity. They are running away from the hospital and
            it's not going to help."<br />
            <br />
             Earlier this week Kupelo warned that parents who were
            negligent over their sons' circumcisions would face the
            full might of the province's Traditional Circumcision
            Act.<br />
            <br />
             Parents found guilty of contravening the act faced a
            fine of R1 000 - which coincidentally is the daily cost
            of hospitalisation for an initiate - or six months in
            jail.<br />
            <br />
             Over 90 other initiates are being treated in various
            Eastern Cape hospitals, four of them facing possible
            genital amputation.<br />
            <br />
             Meanwhile, one Libode chief on Wednesday announced
            measures to clamp down on illegal circumcision in his
            area.<br />
            <br />
             Chief Mangaliso Bokleni said his Gibisela traditional
            council had called an urgent community meeting for
            Thursday to discuss circumcision problems that have
            already claimed the life of one initiate in the
            area.<br />
            <br />
             Bokleni said illegal circumcisions, by unregistered
            traditional surgeons, were a "big problem" in the
            area.<br />
            <br />
             Though 18 was the proper age for circumcision,
            children as young as 11 were being subjected to the
            practice.<br />
            <br />
             Another problem was that youths did not write their
            school exams before going to circumcision
            schools.<br />
            <br />
             Thursday's meeting, which would also be attended by
            health department officials, would introduce a single
            traditional surgeon responsible for the entire council
            area, which covers eight villages.<br />
            <br />
             He would be the only surgeon with authority to
            circumcise boys from those villages.<br />
            <br />
             Along with him would be four traditional nurses
            responsible for management of the initiation schools,
            where boys stay after the circumcision.<br />
            <br />
             Bokleni said the actual circumcisions would be
            performed only on the premises of the council offices,
            and a guardian or parent of the youth would have to be
            present.<br />
            <br />
             The council intended to impose a fine of an ox -
            usually paid in its R600 cash equivalent - on anyone
            who did not comply with these resolutions. - Sapa</p>
