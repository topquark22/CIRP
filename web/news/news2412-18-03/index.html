            18/12/2003 06:11 - (SA) 

            <p>Queenstown - <span class="yellow">Three candidate
            initiates died</span> and 18 were admitted to the
            Frontier and Hewu hospitals due to injuries sustained
            at circumcision schools around the Eastern Cape, police
            reported on Wednesday.</p>

            <p>Spokesperson Captain Gcinikaya Taleni said Thamsanqa
            Mnyaka, 19, of Whittlesea, died on Friday on his way to
            Hewu Hospital. Mnyaka had complained of cramps.</p>

            <p>Myolisi Mayekiso, 18, also of Whittlesea, died after
            complaining of weakness at the school.</p>

            <p>Andile Masabalala, 21, of Tsomo, died on Monday.</p>

            <p>A matron at the Frontier Hospital's surgical ward,
            who did not want to be named said Masabalala died of
            dehydration and anaemia while in the casualty ward and
            while staff were trying to resuscitate him.</p>

            <p>The matron said six other initiates were admitted
            last week.</p>

            <p>Some had gangrene, but none was in a serious
            condition. They would be discharged immediately once
            fully recovered.</p>

            <p>Taleni said they were waiting for postmortem results
            before continuing investigations.</p>

            <p>Documents brought to police suggested that proper
            procedures were followed during the circumcision, he
            said.</p>

            <p>Hewu Hospital manager Monwabisi Mgulwa said 12
            initiates were admitted last week with septicaemia, but
            none was in a serious condition.</p>
