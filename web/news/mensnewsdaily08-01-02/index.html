              <p><b><font face="Courier New, mono">Berkeley,
              CA</font></b> <font face="Courier New, mono">- This
              month, North Dakota District Judge Cynthia
              Rothe-Seeger denied a motion for summary judgment by
              defendants in the Flatt v. Kantak circumcision case,
              and decided it will proceed to trial on February 3,
              2003. The precedent setting decision confirms that a
              baby who is circumcised can sue his doctor when he
              reaches age of majority, even if there was parental
              consent for the circumcision, and even if the results
              are considered to be 'normal.'</font></p>

              <p><font face="Courier New, mono">"This is the latest
              in a series of warnings to doctors who still
              circumcise: proceed at your peril, because even if
              you get parental consent and do a standard job of the
              circumcision, the child can still grow up and sue you
              for taking away part of his penis," says lawyer J.
              Steven Svoboda, executive director of Attorneys for
              the Rights of the Child (<a
              href="http://www.arclaw.org/"
              target="_blank">ARC</a>).</font></p>

              <p><font face="Courier New, mono">Like the on-going
              William Stowell case in New York, this case would be
              a breakthrough in establishing that circumcision is
              litigious even where there is no "botch" and
              "consent" is given, but there are problems with the
              "consent." In this case, the mother was not informed
              about the procedure prior to signing the "consent"
              form. Plaintiff Flatt's attorney Zenas Baer says,
              "There will be a nine-person jury hearing this
              precedent setting case. I am optimistic we will be
              able to have the "informed consent" issue decided by
              the jury. "</font></p>

              <p><font face="Courier New, mono">Svoboda said, "This
              is the second significant legal victory this year,
              after the <a href="/news/ABCnews03-12-01/">case of
              William Stowell</a> also survived summary judgment
              and is proceeding to trial. Both cases will establish
              that, even where the procedure is performed at the
              professional standard, a circumcision is litigious if
              the consent is not informed."</font></p>

              <p><font face="Courier New, mono">Baer added, "The
              court also observed that, in an informed consent
              case, the type of information to be disclosed to a
              parent is a 'standard set by law for physicians
              rather than one which physicians may or may not
              impose upon themselves.' This is a huge statement and
              will put the physicians in their place if we can
              convince nine reasonable people that the physicians
              failed to give adequate information."</font></p>

              <p><font face="Courier New, mono">Marilyn Milos,
              Director of <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/"
              target="_blank">NOCIRC</a>, an organization that
              seeks to end routine infant circumcision in North
              America, says, "Female genital mutilation has been
              outlawed, and we need the law to set the standard
              here, too, followed by aggressive educational
              programs. Parents and doctors need to know that this
              is a harm that lasts a lifetime."</font></p>

              <p><font face="Courier New, mono">Svoboda stated "The
              foundation is well laid for lawsuits. Doctors who are
              still doing circumcisions are already investing in a
              lot of trouble, and this case will make their
              troubles worse. They just have to wait 18 years until
              that baby grows up, and they're in for a lawsuit. An
              army of lawyers will be there with this precedent and
              many more in their arsenal."</font></p>

              <p><font face="Courier New, mono">This landmark case
              brings into question whether a physician can remove
              healthy, normal tissue from unconsenting minors for
              non-therapeutic reasons, and whether a parent can
              legally consent to a medically non-indicated surgery
              for a minor child. Svoboda is convinced that this
              case will have a major impact on circumcision in the
              U.S. "Doctors ignore a lot of medical literature," he
              said, "and they ignore the screams of the babies, but
              they listen when they hear the word 'malpractice.' As
              a lawyer willing to sue, I' ve never had a doctor not
              listen to me."</font></p>

              <p><font face="Courier New, mono"><a
              href="/news/thetribune06-14-02/">Arizona</a> and <a
              href="/news/columbiamissourian07-25-02/">Missouri</a>
              have recently dropped Medicaid funding for
              circumcision, joining six states, and other states
              are considering similar steps. The American Academy
              of Pediatrics (AAP) first acknowledged that there was
              <a
              href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap/#1971">
              no medical justification</a> for routine circumcision
              in 1971. In 1999, the AAP reaffirmed that it <a
              href="/library/statements/aap1999/">does not
              recommend routine circumcision</a>. The American
              Medical Association concurred in 2000, <a
              href="/library/statements/ama2000/">calling routine
              circumcision "non-therapeutic."</a> No national or
              international medical organization recommends routine
              circumcision. The United States is the only country
              that continues to circumcise the majority of its
              newborns for non-religious reasons. As parents have
              become more educated about the surgery, the
              circumcision rate in the US has fallen to
              57%.</font></p>
