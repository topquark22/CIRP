            <p><big><b>T</b></big> he man responsible for carrying
            out a botched circumcision on four week old Callis
            Osaghae at a city centre house on Sunday evening may
            have conducted a number of similar operations in the
            Dublin area on the same day, it has emerged.</p>

            <p>And the man, believed to be of European nationality
            in his 40s, with white hair, could have charged up to
            300 euro per operation, with the parents of the
            deceased child believing he was a doctor.</p>

            <p>As baby Callis, the third child and first born son
            of Nigerians Idehen (31) and Mabel (23) Osaghae, was
            buried in an area set aside for deceased infants at St.
            Otteran's Cemetery, Waterford, yesterday (Thursday),
            Gardai renewed their appeal for information on the man,
            who is no longer believed to be in the city.</p>

            <p>The infant's grieving parents stayed away from
            Callis' burial in a bid to avoid further confrontation
            with journalists who surrounded their home when details
            of the death first emerged. Garda&iacute; maintained a
            uniformed presence at the Summerhill Mews townhouse, as
            the family consistently refused to comment on the
            tragedy. They did, however, attend a prayer service in
            the multi-faith oratory at WRH earlier on Thursday, at
            which they were comforted by family and friends.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">The baby, who would have been a
            month old on Tuesday, died at <a
            href="http://www.hebe.ie/Links/Hospitals/Waterford/"
            target="_blank">Waterford Regional Hospital</a> having
            suffered severe blood loss after what is thought to
            have been a ritual circumcision.</span></p>

            <p>Callis began bleeding heavily after the procedure
            was carried out in the family's rented home close to
            The Glen at about 5pm on Sunday. He was rushed to the
            emergency room at WRH in a taxi by his parents at about
            4.30am on Monday [18 August 2003], but died shortly
            afterwards. The couple had initially summoned the help
            of an ambulance but, as the baby was losing a
            substantial amount of blood, they decided to make their
            own way to the hospital.</p>

            <p>Staff at the hospital subsequently alerted
            Garda&iacute;, who launched an investigation into the
            tragedy. Detectives found no visible marks on the
            infant's body and the results of a post-mortem
            examination carried out by Dr. Margaret Bolster of the
            State Pathologists' office in a bid to identify the
            exact cause of death have so far been inconclusive.
            Further tests are being carried out and are not
            expected to be released for several weeks.</p>
            Red Volvo 

            <p>A Garda spokesperson said a number of people,
            including the infant's parents, had been interviewed as
            part of the ongoing investigation into the tragedy. The
            man who carried out the operation is not thought to
            have any apparent medical training, though Callis'
            parents are said to have thought he was a doctor.
            Gardai are now working on the theory that he travelled
            from Northern Ireland, carried out a number of
            circumcisions in Dublin and then went on to Waterford
            city, in a red Volvo estate. His nationality remains
            unclear.</p>

            <p>It is understood the Osaghaes contacted the man from
            a mobile number they were given by other Nigerians
            living in Waterford and Dublin. The mobile number has
            since been disconnected.</p>

            <p>Idehen and Mabel Osaghae have lived in Waterford
            with their two young daughters for over a year. The
            couple made an application for asylum on 27th June last
            year, but that application was subsequently withdrawn
            after the birth of their second daughter. Callis was
            born at WRH on 19th July. It is thought the family
            wanted the boy circumcised within six weeks of his
            birth for religious reasons, though it is not clear if
            they sought the operation at Ardkeen. A spokesperson
            for the SEHB has confirmed that WRH does not provide
            male circumcisions on religious or cultural grounds. If
            the procedure is deemed necessary on medical grounds,
            it is undertaken under a general anaesthetic and
            usually takes place after a child has reached two years
            of age. Temple St. and Crumlin Children's hospitals in
            Dublin do carry out circumcision for cultural reasons,
            in order to dissuade people from carrying out the
            procedure in unsafe or unhygienic surroundings. Crumlin
            Children's Hospital carried out 31 non-medical
            circumcisions this year, compared to 15 in 1993.</p>

            <p><b>Cultural obligation</b><br />
             Circumcision of young male children is a
            cultural/religious obligation for many of the ethnic
            groups who are making their home in Ireland, according
            to Itayi Viriri of the Irish Refugee Council. He added
            that having the procedure carried out within the
            community is the norm and that it especially applies to
            males from Islamic communities and from Eastern and
            West African countries.</p>

            <p>"This is definitely a cultural and in some aspects a
            religious tradition", he continued. "It is legally
            available in Ireland and is carried out by qualified
            personnel. However, most of these communities, even
            when they move away from home, would have somebody who
            is designated to carry it out within the community. In
            Africa you would not need to go to a hospital for the
            procedure and in most cases everything is fine. Even if
            a family are modernised and affluent enough to have the
            circumcision carried out in a hospital, it would not
            matter, as it is a question of cultural beliefs."</p>

            <p>Reacting to the tragedy, however, Dr. Maurice Geuret
            - a member of the <a href="http://www.erha.ie/"
            target="_blank">Eastern Regional Health Authority</a> -
            said Ireland had become a `haven' for bogus doctors, an
            issue which had been highlighted but not addressed.</p>

            <p>Failed the family</p>

            <p>Meanwhile a member of the <a
            href="http://www.icgp.ie/" target="_blank">Irish
            College of General Practitioners</a>' General Practice
            in a Multicultural Society has slated the Irish medical
            system for failing the Osaghae family.</p>

            <p>Dr. Philip Crowley, project director, said the <a
            href="http://www.sehb.ie/" target="_blank">South
            Eastern Health Board</a> had been contacted earlier
            this year over concerns about the board's failure to
            provide this service in Waterford. "This tragedy has
            shown us that if people are determined to have a child
            circumcised, they will do so. Ireland is now a
            multicultural society and we should have these services
            available to those who chose to use them. We have made
            several representations over the past months, urging
            the health board to develop this service. People would
            be less likely to have these procedures done in their
            own home, were they available in our hospitals. This
            little boy wouldn't have died were the procedure
            carried out in a hospital."</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.finegael.com/index.shtml"
            target="_blank">Fine Gael</a>'s Foreign Affairs
            Spokesperson Gay Mitchell TD said the tragedy had
            raised profound issues which must be addressed without
            further delay, namely that the religious and cultural
            traditions of those who seek male circumcision should
            be respected and accommodated within the public
            hospital system.</p>

            <p>"There has been a huge change in Irish society and
            this should be provided for. A Green Paper on
            Immigration should be published by the Government so
            that these issues can be addressed comprehensively by
            the Oireachtas and State Agencies. The Minister of
            State for European Affairs at the Department of the
            Taoiseach co-ordinates European issues across
            Departments. The Government Chief Whip, as the other
            Minister of State at that Department, should
            co-ordinate immigrant policies so they can be addressed
            across Departments and a Minister can be held directly
            responsible for policy issues. At present nobody is in
            charge of immigrant issues and this cannot be allowed
            to continue."</p>
