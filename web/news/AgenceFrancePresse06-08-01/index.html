      <h2>Jews in uproar over Swedish circumcision law</h2>

      <p>STOCKHOLM, June 8 (AFP) -</p>

      <p>A new Swedish law regulating male circumcision has caused
      an uproar among the Jewish community in Sweden and abroad,
      representatives of Stockholm's Jewish community said
      Friday.</p>

      <p>Under the new law that goes into effect in Sweden on
      October 1, circumcisions can only be carried out on boys
      under the age of two months, and local anesthesia must be
      administered by an authorized nurse or doctor.</p>

      <p>Jewish groups from Europe, Israel and the United States
      meeting in Madrid last week discussed the new law, which they
      view as an unjust restriction on their religion, according to
      Lena Posner-Koeroesi, the chairwoman of Stockholm's Jewish
      community.</p>

      <p>"The reactions I have encountered have been of incredible
      indignation, where people have compared the regulation to
      those Nazi Germany implemented against the Jews,"
      Posner-Koeroesi told the Swedish news agency TT.</p>

      <p>Rare in Scandinavia, about 3,000 Jewish and Muslim boys
      are circumcised for religious reasons each year in
      Sweden.</p>

      <p>Supporters of the new law, adopted June 1, have argued in
      defense of the well-being of children, as debate focused on
      how to respect both the rights of the child and freedom of
      religion.</p>

      <p>Males old enough to make up their own minds are permitted
      to opt for circumcision under the new law.</p>

      <p>In the Jewish religion, circumcision is a rite performed
      on boys when they are eight days old as a sign of inclusion
      in the Jewish community. A tradition that dates back some
      4,000 years, it is performed by a specially trained and
      ordained functionary called a Mohel.</p>

      <p>In presenting the bill to parliament, the Swedish
      government recommended that any qualified person approved by
      the <a href="http://www.sos.se/sosmenye.htm"
      target="_blank">Swedish Board of Health</a> be allowed to
      perform circumcisions, such as a Mohel, using the necessary
      anesthesia.</p>

      <p>But Sweden's parliament went a step further and required
      that the Mohel, or any non-doctor carrying out the operation,
      be assisted by a nurse or doctor to administer local
      anesthesia, a move that has upset the Jewish community.</p>

      <p>According to Posner-Koeroesi, Sweden is the only country
      in the world that has such restrictions on the Jewish
      community.</p>

      <p>Sweden has already banned the ritual Jewish slaughter of
      animals, forcing the community to import its meat.</p>

      <p>"On behalf of the Swedish community and international
      Judaism, I am incredibly upset and bewildered by what Sweden
      is doing," Posner-Koeroesi said.</p>
