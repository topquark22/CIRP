      <h1>11-year-old dies after botched circumcision</h1>
      DUMISANE LUBISI, Bushbuckridge | Thursday 

      <p>AN 11-YEAR-old boy became yet another victim of a botched
      circumcision in the Northern Province when he died just hours
      after being admitted to hospital on Sunday.</p>

      <p>Sipho Mathe of Cork Trust village in Bushbuckridge was
      admitted to Mapulaneng Hospital on Sunday afternoon after
      being circumcised at an initiation school several days
      earlier.</p>

      <p>Calcutta police representative Inspector Thulane Maphanga
      said the boy was in pain for several days, but was only
      rushed to hospital on Sunday when his condition
      deteriorated.</p>

      <p>He is one of nine boys who have died at initiation schools
      in the province this winter.</p>

      <p>Inspector Maphanga said no arrests had been made yet as
      police were still questioning the owner of the initiation
      school, the person who circumcised Mathe and the doctor who
      examined him.</p>

      <p>A provincial circumcision indaba was cancelled at the last
      minute last Tuesday when traditional leaders and healers
      boycotted the event, saying they had not been properly
      consulted and that the event would divulge the secrets of
      circumcision rites.</p>

      <p>The conference was meant to devise stricter safety
      standards at circumcision schools.</p>

      <p>Thousands of boys attend the schools each winter to be
      circumcised as part of their passage into manhood. - African
