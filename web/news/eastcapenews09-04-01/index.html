      <p>Although people supported the Traditional Circumcision
      bill, serious concerns have been raised at public hearings
      which end today, about English terminology and the
      participation of women in the rite.</p>

      <p>Traditional Affairs Standing Committee Chairperson Chief
      Zwelodumo Mtirara said today (subs: tues) his committee is
      listening to "hot debates" in the community.</p>

      <p>He said men did not want women to participate in the
      custom, while women were saying they had parental rights to
      be involved.</p>

      <p>A number of communities said they wanted Xhosa names to be
      used for key figures in the process, such as traditional
      nurses, traditional surgeons, assegai and huts.</p>

      <p>The bill calls for the appointment by the Health MEC of a
      medical officer to oversee circumcisions.</p>

      <p>Although this idea did not go down well among the
      communities, they would only accept the prescence of a
      medical officer if he was "a black man" only.</p>

      <p>Communities were calling for "Iingcibi (traditional
      surgeons) and amakhankatha (traditional nurses)" to be
      trained to deal with wounds. They wanted the custom perfomed
      in the manner it was in the olden days where initiates did
      not eat "delicious" meals and did not drink liquids for the
      first eight days prevent the wounds from "getting wet".</p>

      <p>They wanted the circumsicion instrument to be a
      "sterilised assegai" and not a "pair of doctor's
      scissors."</p>

      <p>Others suggested that a prospective initiate bring his own
      assegai. Parents agreed that before a boy was circumsiced, a
      parent or gurdian had to give consent and that a traditional
      authority should be informed prior to the rite.</p>

      <p>It was suggested that amakhankatha and iingcibi should be
      men above 40 and should be non-drinkers.</p>

      <p>Before Ingcibi could perform the execise, he should not
      have sexual intercourse and not drink for at least 24
      hours.</p>

      <p>Mtirara said the public welcomed the bill but called for
      it to be changed "here and there."</p>

      <p>The committee is expected to meet shortly after hearings
      end today (subs: wed) and start compiling a report for a
      joint standing committee on Health and Traditional
      Affairs.</p>

      <p>The report will be passed to the House of Traditional
      Affairs for scrutiny and then tabled before the legislature
      for the debate and to be passed as an Act, said Mtirara.</p>
