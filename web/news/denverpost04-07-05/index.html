            <h2>Raucous Senate OKs budget plan</h2>

            <p>By Chris Frates<br />
             Denver Post Staff Writer</p>

            <p>The Colorado Senate approved the state's $14.9
            billion spending plan Wednesday following an afternoon
            of raucous debate that included everything from charges
            of pork-barrel spending to circumcision jokes.</p>

            <p>The debate was the first time all 35 senators had
            the chance to tinker with the budget and insert funding
            for pet projects into the 675-page document.</p>

            <p>Democratic Sen. Jim Isgar convinced his colleagues
            to spend $136,471 for a mental-health center outside
            Durango. But the tight budget forced Isgar to cut an
            equal amount from another program.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">He chose to cut funding for
            Medicaid-covered circumcision - eliciting several bad
            jokes.</span></p>

            <p>"The cruelest cut of all," said Republican Sen. Ron
            Teck, recycling a line from last year's budget
            debate.</p>

            <p>Democratic Sen. Lois Tochtrop said, "I rise to the
            occasion to support this amendment."</p>

            <p>At one point, Democratic Sen. Deanna Hanna had to
            remind the upper chamber's members where they were.</p>

            <p>"Senators, we are grown-ups. Please listen to what
            Sen. Isgar is saying," she said over laughter. "It's
            not a middle school, if I may say so."</p>

            <p>The debate did have more serious moments.</p>

            <p>Republican Senate leader Mark Hillman said a list of
            projects recommended by the budget committee had an
            "unmistakable political pattern." Several projects
            added to the list were in the home districts of
            Democrats who control the committee.</p>

            <p>Democratic chairman Sen. Abel Tapia defended the
            choices, noting that the bipartisan panel voted for a
            project in his district.</p>

            <p>Republican Sen. Tom Wiens tried and failed to remove
            the $111,000 in state funding for the University of
            Colorado's ethnic-studies department because of
            professor Ward Churchill's controversial writings.</p>

            <p>Shortly after, Republican Sen. Jim Dyer appeared to
            be nodding off as he sat, eyes closed, off to the side
            of the chamber. Several minutes later, he got up and
            said, "Well, so much for siesta."</p>

            <p>Lawmakers introduced more than 30 amendments to the
            budget and passed about a half dozen. Almost the entire
            debate focused on the $6.2 billion in general-fund
            spending for fiscal 2005-06. The rest of the money that
            makes up the $14.9 billion budget is special cash funds
            and federal funds.</p>
