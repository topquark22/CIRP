      <p><b>"SEX WAS ALWAYS MUCH BETTER WITH A FORESKIN. AFTER IT
      WAS<br />
       REMOVED, IT WAS LIKE GOING FROM TECHNICOLOR TO BLACK AND
      WHITE."</b></p>
    </center>

    <p>Joshua was born a healthy six pound, nine ounce baby boy.
    Shortly after his birth, the baby's mother signed a consent
    form permitting her son's circumcision. During the procedure,
    the obstetrician used a device commonly called the Gomco clamp.
    The tool has two parts: a small cone that slides between the
    foreskin and head of the penis, and a clamp that cuts off the
    circulation of blood to the base of the foreskin. With the
    clamp in place and the foreskin sufficiently desensitized, the
    doctor ripped it from the shaft of Joshua's penis.</p>

    <p>Immediately after the procedure, the doctor wrapped the
    wound in sterile, Vaseline soaked gauze, and Joshua went home
    with his mother the following day. At four the next morning,
    she noticed a reddening on her baby's scrotum and raced back to
    the hospital. The physician removed Joshua's clothing and found
    that most of the infant's skin appeared severely burned. He
    diagnosed the condition as Scalded Skin Syndrome, the result of
    a staph infection that had entered the body through the
    circumcision wound. Despite the hospital's round-the- clock
    care, Joshua died three days later. He was eight days old.</p>

    <p>Each day, more than 3,400 baby boys are circumcised in
    hospitals across the United States. Though the majority of
    these operations are performed without incident, between 2 and
    10 percent of circumcisions result in complications such as
    excessive bleeding, infection, or even death.</p>

    <p><a id="JohnJoan" name="JohnJoan">In what seems a bizarre
    twist, some botched circumcisions have been corrected by
    surgically altering the remaining tissue into female genitalia.
    One such procedure, widely known as the case of John/Joan, was
    recently reported in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent
    Medicine. Based on the theory that the absence of an adequate
    penis would be psychosexually devastating, surgeons removed the
    child's remaining male tissue and constructed a vagina. But
    despite the parents' best efforts at feminization - having the
    child wear dresses and makeup, and letting her receive estrogen
    treatments at age 1 - the child rebelled. At 14, she learned
    the truth about her past and demanded to have her manhood
    restored. Now in his mid twenties, "John" is married and has
    adopted children. He's able to ejaculate, but he must urinate
    while sitting down (through a tube at the base of his
    penis).</a></p>

    <p>Though the rate of circumcision in the United States has
    fallen from a peak of 90 percent in the 1970s to just over 60
    percent today, certain religions, including Islam and Judaism,
    consider it essential. The B'rit Milah, which is performed
    eight days after birth, has been a Jewish custom for nearly
    4,000 years. According to Rabbi Marty Pasternak of Congregation
    Agudas Achim in Austin, Texas, "It's very simple. Circumcision
    is a basic commandment directly spoken by God to Abraham in the
    Old Testament. The b'rit is the first ceremony sanctifying the
    child into the Jewish tradition." Every b'rit must be performed
    by a mohel, or ritual circumciser, who is formally trained in
    both circumcision techniques and Jewish law. There's a definite
    link between circumcision and sacrifice," says Rabbi Daniel
    Silberman Brenner of the National Center for Learning and
    Leadership in New York City. It's a covenant of blood, and
    contact with blood instills a sense that our bodies are a
    sacred thing."</p>

    <p>In the United States, circumcision crossed into the secular
    community in the late 18th century. In 1870, Dr. Lewis A.
    Sayre, the first American surgeon to advocate circumcision,
    found that "relieving the imprisoned glans penis" cured many of
    his patients who suffered from paralysis and hip-joint disease.
    Circumcision became even more fashionable toward the turn of
    the century, when personal cleanliness grew to be associated
    with "good morals, sound health, and upright character,"
    according to David L. Gollaher, Ph.D., president of the
    California Health Care Institute.</p>

    <p>Physicians also began using circumcision to desensitize the
    penis and thus discourage masturbation, which many people
    believed led to blindness, nervousness, insanity, venereal
    disease, tuberculosis, and death. The Journal of Orificial
    Surgery reported in 1898: "Clarence B. was addicted to the
    secret vice practiced amongst boys. I per- formed circumcision.
    He needed the rightful punishment of cutting pains after his
    illicit pleasures. Realizing his error, his eyes grew bright,
    his gait became elastic, his intellect widened, and his memory
    returned."</p>

    <p>Many immigrants to America at the turn of the century looked
    upon cir- cumcision as something of a status symbol - the first
    sign of a baby's birthright in a new land. During the two world
    wars, the military took to circumcising its soldiers -
    unsuccessfully - in an attempt to halt the spread of sexualIy
    transmitted diseases. Meanwhile, this country's medical field
    became increasingly standardized, and women started giving
    birth in hospitals in greater numbers. Following World War II,
    the economic boom resulted in more jobs that offered health
    insurance. By 1960, 85 percent of American males were routinely
    circumcised. It wasn't until the late '60's that the first
    studies to probe the link between circumcision and mental and
    physical health were published.</p>

    <p>The medical community's conclusions regarding circumcision
    are "controversial, to say the least," says Dr. Hans Kersten, a
    pediatrician at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children in
    Philadelphia. "For parents who are undecided, the medical
    evidence just isn't strong enough to say you definitely need
    this." Evidence that supports circumcision generally cites
    reduced rates of penile cancer and sexually transmitted
    diseases, including AIDS. Studies in Kenya suggest that HIV
    infection is more common in men with foreskins. These results,
    however, don't account for cultural, economic, or religious
    differences between the two groups. Another study, conducted by
    Dr. Thomas Wiswell, a pediatrician and professor at Thomas
    Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, followed 200,000
    boys born in U.S. Army hospitals from January 1985 to December
    1990. A subsequent report found that circumcision reduced the
    rate of urinary tract infections (UTIs) almost tenfold.</p>

    <p>Urinary tract infections, however, occur in only one percent
    of all males. "How do you go from a one percent risk of UTI to
    to 0 percent amputation of foreskins?" asks Dr. George
    Denniston, president of <a
    href="http://faculty.washington.edu/gcd/DOC/">Doctors Opposing
    Circumcision</a> (DOC). "The relative risks don't justify the
    act."</p>

    <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has reported that penile
    cancer in the United States is found almost exclusively in
    uncircumcised men. However, in Denmark and Japan - two
    countries where circumcision is not routine - the rate of
    penile cancer is the same as it is in America. According to the
    <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/consent/form.html">Circumcision
    Consent Form</a>, which every parent is required to sign, "It
    is known that most cases of penile cancer are caused by human
    papillomavirus, which is acquired through sexual intercourse.
    More baby boys die each year from circumcision than men die of
    penile cancer."</p>

    <p>With all the studies being done on the effects of
    circumcision, relatively few address the pain of the newborn
    child. Only recently have doctors started administering local
    anesthetics, such as lidocaine, to ease the pain of the
    procedure. But the use of painkillers is still left to the
    physician's discretion. Researchers at the Hospital for Sick
    Children in Toronto found in 1997 that circumcision pain can
    continue to affect an infant several months after the
    operation. Some circumcised newborns were found to be
    particularly sensitive to the pain from their first vaccination
    shots. Infants have even been known to rupture their stomachs,
    sometimes fatally, as a result of hysterical crying following
    circumcision.</p>

    <p>Mohels attribute the need for anesthetics to the technique
    that's followed by hospitals: It requires the baby to be
    strapped to a board for 50 minutes or more and is often
    performed by a doctor not experienced in the procedure. Says
    Canter Philip L. Sherman, a New York City based mohel who has
    performed 8,000 circumcisions, "A traditional b'rit takes only
    no seconds - and that's with the baby lying on a double pillow.
    There is significantly less pain - no anesthetic is
    necessary."</p>

    <p>With annual revenues estimated at $1 billion, circumcision
    is an industry that involves medical equipment manufacturers,
    insurance companies, physicians, and biotech firms.</p>

    <p>Olympic Medical and Allied Healthcare Products are both in
    the business of supplying hospitals with tools for circumcision
    - such as the Circumstraint Board, which immobilizes the infant
    during the procedure, and the aforementioned Gomco clamp.</p>

    <p>Insurance companies are doing their part to defend the
    status quo. According to Dr. W. Knox Fitzpatrick, vice
    president of Medical Affairs for Blue Cross/Blue Shield of
    Utah, "It has been known for decades that circumcision has no
    demonstrable, medically necessary purpose. It is rooted in our
    culture, however, and efforts to the contrary have done little
    to abolish the habit. The public demands that this service be
    included in their insurance policy."</p>

    <p>Without coverage, circumcision's future could be bleak. When
    MediCal, a state sponsored healthcare program in California,
    stopped covering circumcision, the circumcision rate in one
    hospital fell from 35 percent to 6.1 percent. Availability of
    health insurance may also be a reason that circumcision rates
    vary among whites (81 percent), blacks (65 percent), and
    Hispanics (54 percent). In the Midwest, the circumcision rate
    exceeds 80 percent, while in the West, it stands at only 34
    percent.</p>

    <p>The cost of a circumcision varies according to the physician
    and the location. The national average in 1994 was $137, but
    fees ranged from $98 to $400. Multiplying the average cost of a
    procedure by the 1 million operations performed per year
    reveals that doctors are generating $164.4 million annually
    from routine infant circumcision.</p>

    <p>The scientific community has found uses for infant foreskin
    that defy the imagination. According to Frederick Hodges,
    Ph.D., a medical historian at Oxford University, "The after
    market for human foreskin is where the real money is made.
    Foreskins are sold to biomedical companies, which use them in
    the manufacture of insulin. They're also sold to middlemen, who
    package them for sale to research companies that in turn use
    them for biochemical analysis." Corporations such as Advanced
    Tissue Sciences (ATS), Organogenesis, BioSurface Technology,
    Genzyme, and Ortec International are taking cells from
    amputated foreskins and experimenting with artificial skin.
    Products like DermagraftTC, which sells for about 33,000 per
    square foot, are grown from the cells in infant foreskins and
    used as a temporary wound covering for burn patients. One
    foreskin contains enough genetic material to grow 250,000
    square feet of skin.</p>

    <p>For burn patients and diabetics with foot ulcers, foreskin
    grafting can be a more sterile choice than what was available
    just a few years ago. "The advances in this field have been
    astounding," says Janet Wall of Advanced Tissue Sciences. "It
    used to be that when burn patients didn't have enough of their
    own skin to cover wounds, the only alternative was to use skin
    from a cadaver, which raised concerns about the transmission of
    disease." The patient's body would often reject the cadaver
    skin in a matter of days or weeks.</p>

    <p>Parents' decisions about circumcision are often based on
    little that resembles science. Fear of a son's alienation is a
    haunting thought to an expectant father - even if he didn't
    take part in the ridicule as an adolescent, he was probably a
    witness to a scenario like, "Hey Robby, what's wrong with your
    ding a ling? You're weird" And that stigma is nothing compared
    to the scorn of the girl next door. "Nothing prepared me for
    the first time I actually saw one uncircumcised penis - I
    wasn't sure what to make of it," says Sarah M., a student at
    the University of Texas at Austin. A study published in 1988 in
    The Journal of Sex Education Therapy concluded that women
    actually prefer circumcised men.</p>

    <p>The United States is. the only country in the Western
    Hemisphere that routinely practices nonreligious male
    circumcision. As DOC's Dr. Denniston points out, circumcision
    violates one of the basic tenets of medicine: primum non nocere
    (first do no harm). And since the choice is made for them so
    early in life, most men have no idea what they're missing. With
    more than three feet of veins, arteries, and capil- laries, 240
    feet of nerve fibers, and more than 1,000 nerve endings, the
    foreskin is one of the most erotically sensitive parts of the
    penis. Removing it leaves the exposed glans, which reacts best
    to intense pressure or pain. "Sex was always much better with a
    fore- skin," laments Matthew R., who was circumcised at age 21
    for medical reasons. "After it was removed, it was like going
    from technicolor to black and white."</p>

    <p>Not only do the glans and foreskin act as a tag team of
    stimulation, but the foreskin also produces a <a
    href="/library/normal/wright1/">natural moisturizer called
    smegma</a>. Just as the eyelid and tears protect the eye, the
    foreskin and smegma keep the reproductive package in top
    condition. But smegma is a pungent, grayish, cheese like
    substance that can be a nuisance if the penis is not properly
    cleaned. In any case, children are quick to learn how to
    maintain <a href="/library/normal/aap/">proper hygiene</a>.
    Says Matthew R., "It becomes second nature, like washing your
    armpits."</p>
