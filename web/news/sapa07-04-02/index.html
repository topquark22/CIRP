            <h2>Initiate, 42, dies in E Cape</h2>

            <p>A 42-year-old initiate has died at his circumcision
            lodge (ibhuma) at Mbosweni locality in Herschel,
            <span>bringing to six the number who have died in the
            province since the start of this year's circumcision
            period.</span></p>

            <p>Captain Mpofana Skwatsha said Zibusile Kwili, 42,
            died at his lodge on Monday afternoon after complaining
            of stomach pains.</p>

            <p>He said there was no evidence to suggest that Kwili
            was being ill-treated.</p>

            <p>Another initiate was admitted to the Umtata General
            Hospital on Tuesday night bringing to 14 the number of
            initiates receiving treatment there. The 18-year-old
            had signs of "beatings" but was reported to be in a
            stable condition.</p>

            <p>The dead initiates are from Whittlesea, Mount
            Ayliff, Libode, Ntabankulu, Herschel and East
            London.</p>

            <p>The provincial health department has not disclosed
            their names. Reasons for the deaths have been given as
            septicaemia, negligence and natural causes.</p>

            <p>Acting chief medical superintendent of the Umtata
            General Hospital, Dr Zola Dabula, said the condition of
            all the post-circumcision initiation candidates was
            "very stable".</p>

            <p>They were suffering from minor genital infections -
            the result of unhygienic practices - and were being
            kept in a holding ward.</p>
