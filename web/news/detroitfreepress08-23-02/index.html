            <p>Driving. Flying planes. Now add one more thing that
            drinking doesn't go with: circumcision.</p>

            <p>A man on his way to perform a ritual Jewish
            circumcision on an 8-day-old infant was arrested on a
            charge of driving under the influence blocks from his
            destination. He is scheduled to appear at a pretrial
            hearing Monday before 52-1 District Court Judge Michael
            Batchik.</p>

            <p>Samuel Greenbaum, 58, was charged June 18 with
            driving under the influence and failing to undergo a
            Breathalyzer test. Greenbaum, a cantor and former
            president of the congregation at <a
            href="http://www.congbethshalom.org/"
            target="_blank">Beth Shalom</a> in Oak Park, is one of
            only a handful of Detroit-area mohels -- those who
            perform the delicate Jewish ritual that involves
            removing a male infant's foreskin with a razor-sharp
            scalpel.</p>

            <p>The arrest stunned the baby's parents who had staged
            an elaborate gathering of 70 family members and friends
            to witness the traditional Jewish procedure, called a
            bris.</p>

            <p>"He was essentially about to perform surgery on my
            son," said Ken Gutman, of West Bloomfield Township. "If
            the charges are true, it's an inexcusable betrayal of
            trust."</p>

            <p>Neither Greenbaum nor his attorney, Gerald
            Gordinier, returned phone messages left Wednesday and
            Thursday.</p>

            <p>Oakland County Sheriff's Capt. Michael McCabe said
            an off-duty West Bloomfield police officer reported
            Greenbaum driving his red 1999 Ford Taurus erratically
            in Commerce Township late in the afternoon on June 18.
            A deputy confirmed the erratic driving and watched
            Greenbaum cut off another driver before pulling him
            over, McCabe said.</p>

            <p>After smelling intoxicants, and based on the results
            of a preliminary breath test and field sobriety tests,
            deputies arrested Greenbaum, McCabe said.</p>

            <p>"He indicated he had performed a bris earlier in the
            day, and had a couple glasses of wine there," McCabe
            said. "And he told the deputy he was on his way to
            another one, and had a lot of people waiting for
            him."</p>

            <p>Gutman, principal of Scripps Middle School near Lake
            Orion, said the bris was performed by a different mohel
            two days later. It was a deviation from strict Jewish
            tradition which calls for abris on a baby's eighth day
            of life. "Under the circumstances, I think God would
            understand," said Gutman. "I think things happen for a
            reason, and ultimately circumstances prevented him from
            arriving."</p>

            <p>Gutman's initial anger has subsided, and he even
            understands why the incident merited a mention by
            late-night comic Jay Leno.</p>

            <p>"Yeah, it was on Leno," he said. "It was
            hysterical.</p>

            <p>"Unless you were my son."</p>
