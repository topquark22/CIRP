            <h2>State stops paying for Viagra, sex changes</h2>

            <p>Maura Lerner, Star Tribune<br />
             September 1, 2005</p>

            <p>The state of Minnesota is quietly getting out of the
            business of paying for three controversial treatments
            that affect the sex lives or sex organs of low-income
            patients.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Starting today, the state will
            no longer cover routine circumcisions, unless "required
            by religious practice," under its insurance plans for
            670,000 low-income Minnesotans, according to the <a
            href="http://www.dhs.state.mn.us/main/groups/agencywide/documents/pub/dhs_Home_Page.hcsp"
             target="_blank">Department of Human
            Services</a>.</span></p>

            <p>It's also dropping coverage of Viagra and other
            impotence drugs.</p>

            <p>And last month, it completely stopped paying for
            sex-change operations.</p>

            <p>Each of the three changes in coverage may face legal
            problems.</p>

            <p>The Legislature voted to end the payments with
            little fanfare during the special session in July.
            Supporters say they were "no brainers" at a time when
            legislators desperately needed to cut costs without
            doing serious harm to the programs: MinnesotaCare,
            Medical Assistance and General Assistance Medical
            Care.</p>

            <p>Even state officials admit that the new rules may be
            challenged by civil liberties groups and activists, and
            in one case would require a federal agency to reverse
            its policy.</p>

            <p>But at least one Stillwater woman hopes the changes
            will spur a sea change in Minnesota, to help turn the
            tide against what she considers an unnecessary and
            barbaric procedure.</p>

            <p>Ending circumcisions</p>

            <p>In recent years, about 10,000 baby boys have been
            circumcised each year at state expense, at an average
            cost of $54, according to the Human Services
            Department. That's 10,000 too many to Cindy Tregilgas,
            a Stillwater financial manager and mother of two sons.
            For several years, as a volunteer for NoCirc, the <a
            href="http://www.nocircmn.org/"
            target="_blank">National Organization of Circumcision
            Information Resource Centers</a>, she had lobbied the
            Legislature to stop circumcision. This year, her
            testimony helped change the policy, <span
            class="yellow">making Minnesota the 16th state to do
            so.</span></p>

            <p>At a House hearing in March, she said: "I have come
            here today not to ask for money, but instead to show
            you where money can be saved." She argued that taxpayer
            dollars were wasted on a "cosmetic procedure." While
            she opposes circumcision on moral grounds, she said,
            the money argument was especially persuasive. "Frankly
            if it's ten dollars to spend on something that's
            totally unnecessary and can cause harm vs. spending on
            necessary medical services for low-income people, it's
            a no-brainer," she said.</p>

            <p>The bill's sponsor, Rep. Jim Abeler, R-Anoka, a
            chiropractor and father of six boys, agreed. "There's
            no medical indication, [and] we're looking for ways to
            save some money," he said. However, he added two
            exemptions, to allow payment if it's medically
            necessary or part of someone's "religious
            practice."</p>

            <p>Circumcision is practiced by Jews and Muslims, but
            he said neither group asked for the exemption. "I
            thought it seemed reasonable," he said.</p>

            <p>Assistant Human Services Commissioner Brian Osberg,
            who oversees the state health plans, acknowledged that
            the religious exemption might pose problems. "We have
            not determined exactly how we're going to process that
            exception," he said.</p>

            <p>Its legality was questioned by Charles Samuelson,
            executive director of the <a
            href="http://www.aclu-mn.org/" target="_blank">American
            Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota</a>, who wondered
            how the state could base payments on a patient's
            religion. "It just doesn't make sense," he said. "My
            guess is that if it was challenged, they would be hard
            pressed to keep that exception."</p>

            <p>Abeler, the sponsor, said he included it as a show
            of respect to other religions, and doesn't believe it
            affects many people. "So if it's an issue, there
            wouldn't be a big fight," he said.</p>

            <p>In any case, Tregilgas hopes this is just the
            beginning. Now, most private insurers cover routine
            circumcision in Minnesota. <span class="yellow">In
            other states, she said, private insurers have followed
            the government's lead. "I think it will take some time.
            But I do think that over time, [fewer] insurance
            companies are going to cover it."</span></p>

            <p>No more Viagra</p>

            <p>About 2,000 men got impotence drugs last year
            courtesy of the state's Medicaid program, at a cost of
            roughly $7 a pill (up to six a month), state officials
            say.</p>

            <p>It seemed like a natural place to save money, said
            Suzy Geroux, administrator for the House Health Policy
            and Finance committee. For the past seven years,
            Minnesota has covered impotence drugs under pressure
            from the federal government. In 1998, the Clinton
            administration issued a directive warning that states
            could lose federal funds if the drugs weren't covered
            under Medicaid.</p>

            <p>With the change in political winds, state officials
            say this is the time to challenge that policy. "It's
            really an interpretation of the law," Osberg said.
            Although the ban kicks in today, the state hasn't
            obtained federal permission to implement the change.
            Officials say they plan to submit that request later
            this month.</p>

            <p>Closing a 'loophole'</p>

            <p>Minnesota has tried to end Medicaid payments for
            sex-change operations for 10 years. But activists have
            challenged the restrictions in court. As a result, two
            to three people a year have had their sex-change
            operations paid for by state programs, at a total cost
            of about $15,000 in state funds, officials say. The new
            law, which took effect Aug. 1, "completely closes the
            loophole," Geroux said.</p>

            <p>State lawyers say they expect court challenges to
            continue. Phil Duran, a lawyer for OutFront Minnesota,
            an advocacy group, says he's appealing the department's
            denials to five patients awaiting sex-change surgery.
            "It's certainly our position that this is not about
            saving money," he said. "This is about imposing a
            [penalty] on politically unpopular people."</p>
