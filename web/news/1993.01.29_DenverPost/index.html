      <h2>24 nurses at hospital boycott circumcision</h2>
      By the Associated Press
    </center>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Twenty-four nurses at a Santa Fe hospital refuse to help
      in circumcisions of newborns.</p>

      <p>"Ethically, we find ourselves unable to assist with the
      procedure," the nurses said in a latter to doctors at St.
      Vincent Hospital. "Routine circumcision of the newborn
      conflicts with our beliefs."</p>

      <p>Mary-Rose Booker said circumcision is unnecessary and
      hurts.</p>

      <p>Mary Conant, a leader of the group, declined to elaborate
      but said the nurses would hold a news conference next week to
      explain.</p>

      <p>Thirty-five nurses at St. Vincent continue to help with
      the surgery, and the boycott hasn't harmed the hospital's
      ability to perform circumcisions, a spokesman said.</p>

      <p>Dr. Justina Trott, medical director, said no disciplinary
      action has been taken.</p>

      <p>"The hospital has no position on circumcision," said
      nursing director Annette Hall. "This decision is between a
      physician and the child's patients [sic--should probably be
      'parents']. We support professional nursing staff
      participation in patient education."</p>

      <p>Urologist Stephen Lucero accused the nurses of "jumping in
      with misinformation and misleading the public."</p>

      <p>Booker said the group hasn't tried to sway parents but has
      offered information form both sides and invited parents to
      watch a videotape of a circumcision being performed.</p>

      <p>Mary Harwell of <i>Mothering</i> magazine said her Santa
      Fe publication supports the nurses' stand. The magazine says
      parents need to be more aware of the pros and cons of
      circumcision before approving the procedure.</p>
