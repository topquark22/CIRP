            <h2>Girl's Life in Danger After Cut</h2>

            The Nation (Nairobi) NEWS December 6, 2003 Posted to
            the web December 6, 2003 By Nation Team Nairobi 

            <p>A 13-year-old girl who was circumcised secretly and
            bled profusely is fighting for her life in
            hospital.</p>

            <p>The girl, who is diabetic, is among six others, who
            underwent the ritual secretly early this week at
            Kamudugi village in Siongiroi Division, Bomet.</p>

            <p>She is at <a
            href="http://www.tenwek.org/twk/default.htm"
            target="_blank">Tenwek Mission Hospital</a> in critical
            condition.</p>

            <p>Her father is said to have been opposed to the rite.
            She was allegedly sneaked out of home by her mother,
            who had secretly arranged for the circumcision.</p>

            <p>Siongiroi District Officer Joseph Rono said the
            circumciser was arrested yesterday and is helping the
            police with investigations.</p>

            <p>Mr Rono said the ban on female circumcision was
            still in force. "I will make sure all parents who have
            forced their daughters to be circumcised are arrested
            and charged in court," he said.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, a massive manhunt has been launched for
            the circumciser who chopped off the genitals of an
            11-year at Ndanai Division last week.</p>

            <p>The boy is still in serious condition at Litein AIC
            Mission Hospital.</p>
