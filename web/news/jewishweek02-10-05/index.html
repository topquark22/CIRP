            <h3><i>Baby&rsquo;s death from herpes virus sparks call
            for oversight.</i></h3>
            Debra Nussbaum Cohen - Staff Writer 

            <p>The case of the Monsey mohel who may have infected
            three newborn boys with the herpes virus is prompting
            some to wonder if the field requires greater
            oversight.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/nydailynews02-02-05/">The
            three boys contracted herpes simplex virus 1</a>, the
            type which in adults usually causes only a mouth sore,
            but can overwhelm a newborn&rsquo;s system. <span
            class="yellow">One of the babies, who was circumcised
            in October, died ten days later.</span> He and his twin
            brother tested positive for the virus. The third is a
            Staten Island boy who also tested positive after being
            circumcised by Fischer in late 2003.</p>

            <p>Unlike doctors and most rabbis, those who perform
            Jewish ritual circumcision are not required to belong
            to any professional organization, instead operating
            independently and relying on referrals for new
            business.</p>

            <p>The current news centers on <a
            href="http://www.bris-milah.com/" target="_blank">Rabbi
            Yitzchok Fischer</a>, a man in his 60s who has worked
            as a mohel for decades, performing tens of thousands of
            ritual circumcisions in the New York area, in Israel
            and in the former Soviet Union.</p>

            <p>New York City&rsquo;s <a
            href="http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/doh/home.html"
            target="_blank">Department of Health and Mental
            Hygiene</a> has filed a civil suit against Rabbi
            Fischer, requiring him to give blood samples for
            testing and enjoining him from suctioning the requisite
            drop of blood by using his mouth. A court order also
            requires him to wear rubber gloves and take other steps
            to prevent infection.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.co.rockland.ny.us/health/default.htm"
            target="_blank">Rockland County health officials</a>
            say that they are now also planning to review Rabbi
            Fischer&rsquo;s circumcisions.</p>

            <p>Reached at his home, Rabbi Fischer declined to be
            interviewed, citing instructions from his attorney.</p>

            <p>Mohelim, or Jewish ritual circumcisers, operate in
            an essentially unregulated field, unlike doctors, who
            are licensed by the state and rabbis, most of whom
            belong to professional organizations with set
            standards.</p>

            <p>Leading rabbis and mohelim differ as to whether it
            would be beneficial to have mohelim more closely
            supervised.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.nybr.org/">New York Board of
            Rabbis</a> has recently discussed this very issue, said
            its executive vice president, Rabbi Joseph Potasnik.
            For many years it had a Brit Milah Board, which
            certified mohelim, but it has been defunct for the last
            decade, he said.</p>

            <p>Now is the time to revive it in one form or another,
            said Rabbi Potasnik, and he expects that the
            organization will put a new Brit Milah service in place
            within the next six weeks.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;There needs to be strict oversight in these
            matters,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;People rely upon some
            kind of verification that the mohel is fully suitable
            to perform the rite. That means also that there&rsquo;s
            a malpractice policy in place. If we&rsquo;re going to
            recommend someone for something so sacred that has this
            physical component, we need to be very clear
            we&rsquo;ll only recommend someone who fulfills all of
            our requirements.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>However, he says, it should be the Jewish community,
            rather than the government, providing this oversight.
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always dangerous to have the state
            involved in a religious procedure. We in the Jewish
            community are the more appropriate place to define what
            the criteria should be and monitor to see that they are
            fulfilled.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>One of the last steps in a brit milah involves
            suctioning blood from where the foreskin has been
            removed. Historically, this was done orally, with the
            mohel directly putting his mouth on the newly
            circumcised penis and sucking in the blood, a procedure
            called metzizah b&rsquo;peh.</p>

            <p>In recent decades, however, the practice has been
            continued only in some elements of the fervently
            Orthodox community.</p>

            <p>According to his attorney, Mark Kurzmann, Rabbi
            Fischer suctions by mouth only if the baby&rsquo;s
            parents request it. Other times, he uses the techniques
            more commonly utilized by non-haredi mohelim, which
            involve suctioning through a small plastic tube, or
            gently wiping the area with a piece of gauze, and in
            the process creating sufficient suction to draw away
            residual blood.</p>

            <p>Mohelim in the fervently Orthodox community say that
            only the most traditional method, the one cited in
            Jewish legal sources, is acceptable.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Our teachers taught us to use our
            mouths,&rdquo; said Crown Heights-based mohel Rabbi
            Israel Heller, who is the official mohel of <a
            href="http://www.nym.org/" target="_blank">Methodist
            Hospital</a> in Park Slope, Brooklyn.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;The saliva cleans wounds. God gave us saliva
            in our mouth to clean things.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>A spokesman for <a
            href="http://www.ou.org/network/agudah/aboutagudah.htm"
            target="_blank">Agudath Israel of America</a>, which
            represents the interests of the fervently Orthodox,
            doesn&rsquo;t think that any new form of oversight is
            necessary.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;There is a point when the government has a
            right to step in, when there&rsquo;s a clear and
            present threat to the public. Then public policy can
            override religious rights, but I don&rsquo;t think
            that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s before us at this
            point,&rdquo; said Rabbi Avi Shafran.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Word of mouth is the best regulatory system,
            and the system has worked very well,&rdquo; he said.
            &ldquo;There should be no ban on metzizah b&rsquo;peh,
            and no required testing of mohelim.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>According to Rabbi Tzvi Hersh Weinreb, executive
            vice president of the <a href="http://www.ou.org/"
            target="_blank">Orthodox Union</a> and a clinical
            psychologist, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know the facts of
            this case, and I am not sure that one isolated case,
            however tragic, warrants a major change in the
            system.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Mohelim and rabbis are concerned that the headlines
            about the current case might turn some people off to
            the idea of having their sons ritually circumcised.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the kind of thing that
            unfortunately plays to some people&rsquo;s worst
            feelings,&rdquo; said Rabbi Shafran. &ldquo;There is an
            anti-circumcision crowd out there, and they certainly
            will seize upon it.&rdquo;</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Cantor Philip Sherman, a
            well-known Manhattan-based mohel, said he spoke with an
            interfaith couple and &ldquo;the wife said her husband
            doesn&rsquo;t want to do it now. I&rsquo;ve had a
            number of phone calls this week. There is such a
            tremendous anti-circumcision movement out there as it
            is, and this will only fuel the fire.</span></p>

            <p>&ldquo;Way back when, drawing blood out of a wound
            was thought to remove impurities and was considered
            medically necessary,&rdquo; said Cantor Sherman, who
            does not suction directly with his mouth and says the
            custom has no bearing on the validity of the brit.</p>

            <p>Rabbi Heller said he recently performed a brit milah
            on the new grandson of a urologist. Present were a
            well-known Modern Orthodox rabbi and several
            doctor-colleagues of the baby&rsquo;s grandfather. When
            he saw Rabbi Heller do metzizah b&rsquo;peh, the rabbi
            commented negatively, but the doctors all said that it
            was medically acceptable, according to Rabbi Heller,
            since he carefully washed his hands and mouth
            beforehand with antiseptic.</p>

            <p>He said that good mohelim test themselves every
            three months for diseases, including HIV, hepatitis and
            herpes. &ldquo;We check ourselves more than surgeons
            check themselves,&rdquo; Rabbi Heller said. And if he
            has any kind of pimple or sore in his mouth, he has
            another mohel perform the brit milah for him.</p>

            <p>Rabbi Heller, who knows Rabbi Fischer and spoke with
            him recently, says that the Monsey mohel is &ldquo;very
            hurt that this happened.&rdquo; But it hasn&rsquo;t
            hampered his work, said Rabbi Heller. Since the lawsuit
            was filed, Rabbi Fischer has performed &ldquo;a few
            hundred brisses,&rdquo; he said.</p>

            <p>He also said that in the case of the Staten Island
            boy who tested positive, his mother tested for the
            virus. The baby who died in November had a rash in his
            diaper area before the brit milah, which Rabbi Fischer
            insisted be checked out by a pediatrician, according to
            Rabbi Heller. The pediatrician gave the go-ahead for
            the brit, he said.</p>

            <p>Mark Kurzmann, Rabbi Fischer&rsquo;s attorney,
            declined to comment on the medical status of anyone
            involved, including that of his client.</p>

            <p>He did say, however, that Rabbi Fischer &ldquo;is
            cooperating fully with the city&rsquo;s investigation,
            and that he consulted with his personal physician and
            was advised that there was absolutely no risk of any
            herpes infection from his performing a brit.&rdquo;</p>
