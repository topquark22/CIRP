                  <h4 align="center">Oral-suction circumcision</h4>
                  If a mohel is infected with oral herpes and
                  performs an oral-suction circumcision, the infant
                  can be exposed to the herpes virus. Oral herpes
                  spreads easily through saliva, especially when
                  saliva touches a cut or break in the skin, such
                  as during metzitzah b'peh.<br />
                  <br />
                  <br />
                   The New York City Health Department's letter on
                  oral suction circumcision can be found at <a
                  href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/std/std-bris.shtml"
                   target="_blank">www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/std/std-bris.shtml</a><br />

                  <br />
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>The New York City Health Department has recommended
            that infants not undergo oral-suction circumcisions
            after several babies were infected with herpes.</p>

            <p>The department's action was prompted after a
            Monsey-based rabbi was suspected of infecting three
            babies with herpes in 2004. One died and another
            suffered brain damage. The department said two more
            cases were reported in the city this year.</p>

            <p>The centuries-old practice, called <i>metzizah bi
            peh</i> or <i>metzitzah b'peh</i>, involves a mohel
            using his mouth to suction blood from the wound after
            the foreskin is removed. The ritual is used by Hasidic
            and ultra-Orthodox Jews.</p>

            <p>The Monsey rabbi, Yitzchok Fischer, 57, has agreed
            to stop performing the oral procedure until a religious
            panel investigates the method. The agreement between
            Fischer and New York City ended a court case brought by
            the city.</p>

            <p>Because the religious panel did not offer its
            recommendations by a Dec. 1 deadline, New York City
            Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas R. Frieden this week
            issued his warnings to the Jewish community in a
            letter.</p>

            <p>"Because there is no proven way to reduce the risk
            of herpes infection posed by metzitzah b'peh, the
            Health Department recommends that infants being
            circumcised not undergo metzitzah b'peh," Frieden
            wrote.</p>

            <p>Frieden wrote that parents must be made aware of the
            risks associated with oral-suction circumcision, even
            though the chances of the infant contracting herpes is
            considered rare.</p>

            <p>A newborn's immune system is not developed enough to
            fight serious infection, and herpes infections pose
            grave risks, he said.</p>

            <p>The <a
            href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/home/home.shtml"
            target="_blank">New York City Health Department</a>
            investigation found that Fischer infected three
            children with herpes in 2004 through oral-suction
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>Two additional cases of infant herpes through the
            oral-suction method were reported by physicians in
            2005, the commissioner wrote. The identity of that
            mohel or mohels was not revealed.</p>

            <p>Fischer had agreed to stop using the method this
            year while his court case was pending, authorities
            said.</p>

            <p>The department found that in all cases, the
            transmission of herpes was within the time frame of an
            oral-suction circumcision, Frieden said.</p>

            <p>Many rabbis say that Jewish law does not mandate
            mouth suction and that a mohel is allowed to use a
            tube, sponge or sterile gauze pad instead of the mouth
            to wipe away blood. Others contend it is mandated by
            Jewish law, and the spread of disease is rare.</p>

            <p>Fischer's lawyer, Mark J. Kurzmann of Pearl River,
            has said there has been no conclusive medical evidence
            that the infants contracted the virus from the rabbi.
            He said the rabbi used oral suction for two of the
            three circumcisions in question. Oral-suction
            circumcisions were done on the twins who became
            infected with herpes.</p>

            <p>Rockland Health Commissioner Dr. Joan Facelle also
            has voiced concerns about the health risks posed by the
            procedure. She said her department had not received any
            reports of herpes in infants in Rockland, and she
            couldn't legally prevent the use of the procedure.</p>

            <p>Facelle has said she planned to start an educational
            campaign in Rockland to inform parents about the
            potential risks.</p>

            <p>Most people with oral herpes don't know they are
            infected and have no symptoms, the city Health
            Department said. Even without symptoms, people can
            spread the infection.</p>
