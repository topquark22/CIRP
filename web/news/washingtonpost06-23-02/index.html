      <h4>North Carolina Group Fights State Funding for
      Circumcisions</h4>

      <p>Are you or aren't you?</p>

      <p>It's not a delicate question, that's for sure. But some
      lawmakers in Raleigh, N.C., seem to want to answer it, even
      when no one is asking.</p>

      <p>There is just something about the debate over using state
      money to pay for circumcisions that can turn hallway lobbying
      sessions with legislators into strangely revealing
      confessionals, said <a
      href="http://www.nocircnc.org/donna.htm"
      target="_blank">Donna Larkin</a>, a circumcision
      opponent.</p>

      <p>"A lot of them are older gentlemen," said Larkin, a
      supermarket checker from the tiny town of Troutman in central
      North Carolina. "They'll tell you their circumcision status.
      They'll say: 'Well, I'm circumcised. . . .' I'm like, 'I
      don't need to know <i>that.</i>' "</p>

      <p>Larkin and a group of circumcision opponents are pushing
      the <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/"
      target="_blank">North Carolina Legislature</a> to cut
      payments for circumcisions from the state's Medicaid program.
      They say the procedure is medically unnecessary and
      traumatic, limits sexual pleasure and increases the chances
      of urinary tract infections.</p>

      <p>They won a brief victory last year when the state
      suspended circumcision coverage for two months before <a
      href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/" target="_blank">Gov.
      Mike Easley</a> (D) prevailed on the state's <a
      href="http://www.dhhs.state.nc.us/" target="_blank">Health
      and Human Services Department</a> to restore the funding. Now
      the circumcision opponents are back, hoping to make North
      Carolina the eighth state to end such coverage.</p>

      <p>An early version of the state budget passed last week by
      the state Senate removes circumcision coverage, which amounts
      to about $250,000 a year. But many rewrites lie ahead.</p>
