            <h2>Cutting anger</h2>

            <p>By Tanya Moore</p>

            <p>DOUBLE standards allowed two boys to be circumcised
            without their mother's permission, an outraged
            Australian Health group said yesterday.</p>

            <p>Circumcision Information Australia spokesman Shane
            Peterson said the case in which a six- and
            nine-year-old boy were circumcised by their Bundaberg
            father, despite their mother's opposition, was "a
            tragedy''.</p>

            <p>"In European countries the written permission of
            both parents is necessary before a doctor can legally
            perform a circumcision on boys,'' Mr Peterson said.</p>

            <p>"This rule should be implemented in Australia to
            prevent such tragedies.''</p>

            <p>Mr Peterson said the case illustrated a double
            standard whereby female circumcision was condemned as
            mutilation while male circumcision was viewed as
            trivial or even a beneficial adjustment.</p>

            <p>He said the case also highlighted the lack of
            implementation of the <a
            href="/library/ethics/UN-convention/">UN Convention on
            the Rights of the Child</a> by Australian law.</p>

            <p>The mother of the boys is also angry at what she
            sees as a double standard on circumcision.</p>

            <p>"If I had been in this current situation with two
            daughters who were circumcised by their Muslim father,
            the Australian public would be outraged,'' said the
            woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons.</p>

            <p>"Because it is my two sons who have been harmed, few
            people seem to care.''</p>

            <p>She said her estranged husband had performed the
            operation during an access visit to the children last
            year.</p>

            <p>Grievous bodily harm and unlawful wounding charges
            were laid against the boys' father, but these were
            dropped on Thursday when the prosecution revealed they
            were not ready to proceed with their case.</p>

            <p>Detective Senior Constable Peter Cormack, from the
            Gold Coast child abuse investigation unit, said police
            would still pursue the case, on which charges could
            still be laid.</p>
