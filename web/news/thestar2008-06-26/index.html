            <h2>Eight initiates taken to hospital</h2>
            <i>26 June 2008, 13:13</i> 

            <p>Eight initiates have been taken to Mthatha General
            Hospital after they were found trapped in a shack in
            the Qokolweni Village outside Mthatha, the <a
            href="http://www.ecdoh.gov.za/" target="_blank">Eastern
            Cape health department</a> said on Thursday.<br />
            <br />
             Spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said police and health
            officials had raided the initiation school in the early
            hours of Thursday morning.<br />
            <br />
             "They found 76 boys trapped in crowded and unhealthy
            conditions in a shack and two small rondavels. Eight of
            the boys have been taken to hospital," said
            Kupelo.<br />
            <br />
             One of the boys was in a critical condition with
            sceptic wounds and was dehydrated, said Kupelo.<br />
            <br />
             <span class="yellow">"Another boy's private parts did
            not have blood and the six others are being treated for
            sceptic wounds," he said.</span><br />
            <br />
             He said the traditional surgeon was warned to improve
            the living conditions of the initiates.<br />
            <br />
             Kupelo said a raid was currently being conducted in
            the Libode area, following reports of an illegal
            initiation school operating there.<br />
            <br />
             Several traditional surgeons were being sought by
            police for operating illegally.<br />
            <br />
             <span class="yellow">At least nine initiates have died
            since the beginning of the annual winter circumcision
            season.</span><br />
            <br />
             Police were not immediately available for comment. -
