            <h2>Take boys home, parents urged</h2>

            <p>Johannesburg - The <a
            href="http://www.gpg.gov.za/index.html"
            target="_blank">Gauteng</a> health department is urging
            parents in local communities to get youths at
            initiation schools in the rugged hills around
            Heidelberg to come home.</p>

            <p>Spokesperson Simon Zwane said the department and
            local authorities considered the further stay of
            initiates at the schools to be a health risk.</p>

            <p>Zwane was commenting after the <a
            href="/news/sapa07-02-02a/">death of a sixth
            initiate</a> on Monday.</p>

            <p>Papa Mbovane (19) reportedly died of internal
            injuries at Heidelberg Hospital after he had been
            returned to an initiation school by his family on
            Wednesday last week. He had been removed from the
            school the day before.</p>

            <p>"The death of this boy should not have occurred. We
            have now requested the local authority to speak to the
            community and the parents of children still undergoing
            initiation to please allow the children to go home. We
            regard their continued stay there a health risk," Zwane
            said.</p>

            <p>He added that Sedibeng district mayor, Peter
            Skosana, was already pressing communities in his area
            on the issue.</p>

            <p>Skosana had also asked police to assist parents in
            bringing their children home, Zwane said.</p>

            <p>East Rand police spokesperson Superintendent Andy
            Pieke on Tuesday said <span class="yellow">two cases of
            abduction</span> in relation to children undergoing
            initiation had been opened at Orange Farm and were
            being investigated. He said parents had alleged their
            children were at the schools without their
            permission.</p>

            <p><b>15 schools shut down</b></p>

            <p>Gauteng MEC Gwen Ramokgopa said on Monday she would
            wait for a report from health officials before closing
            down any further initiation schools in the Heidelberg
            area, where five boys died and more than 30 injured
            after botched initiations last week.</p>

            <p>Ramokgopa has closed down three schools, and six
            people, including instructors and traditional healers
            have been arrested in connection with the deaths and
            assault of initiates.</p>

            <p>She said on Monday that officials from her
            department were inspecting other schools in the area
            and conditions at them before she would take any
            further action.</p>

            <p>In Limpopo province, officials closed down six more
            illegal circumcision schools, bringing to 15 the number
            shut down in recent days, SABC radio reported.</p>

            <p>The MEC in the premier's office, Catherine Mabuza,
            accompanied police when they acted against the schools
            in the Waterberg area.</p>

            <p>Fify-nine initiates were taken to the Mokopane
            hospital. Some of the boys had septic wounds and had to
            be put on drips.</p>

            <p>In the Eastern Cape, another mutilated initiation
            candidate was admitted to the Umtata General Hospital
            on Tuesday, bringing the total number admitted since
            the weekend to 13.</p>

            <p>The hospital's acting chief medical superintendent,
            Dr Zola Dabula, said the condition of all the
            post-circumcision initiation candidates was stable.</p>

            <p><b>Gangrenous penis</b></p>

            <p>Dabula said they were suffering from minor genital
            infections - the result of unhygienic practices - and
            were being kept in a holding ward.</p>

            <p>Four other youths, who have been in hospital for
            about a week, were being kept in a separate ward.</p>

            <p>Their condition was stable but more serious, Dabula
            said. Three of them were suffering from acute
            dehydration while the fourth had lost his penis after
            it fell off due to gangrene.</p>

            <p>Dabula said that boys whose penises fall off after
            circumcision had to live with a urinary catheter and a
            bag for about a year before penile reconstructive
            surgery could be done.</p>

            <p>Speaking of the boys' life after surgery, Dabula
            said: "It's not a normal life as such - they can
            urinate but they are compromised in their sexual
            activity."</p>

            <p><a href="/news/eastcapenews10-25-01/">The Eastern
            Cape government last year passed legislation to
            regulate circumcision practices</a>, making initiation
            school surgeons liable to six to 10 year prison
            sentences if they broke the law.</p>

            <p>The province also launched an education and
            awareness programme aimed at encouraging people to have
            their circumcision done in hospitals.</p>

            <p>"I must say that previously we had very serious
            problems with circumcision in this area. Last year
            December we lost two patients. But right now we haven't
            lost anyone. I give credit to our educational
            process.</p>

            <p><b>Amakhankatha</b></p>

            <p>"We have created a system whereby people who would
            like to be circumcised medically come over here. We
            circumcise them and thereafter they go and finish their
            initiation into manhood in the bushes," Dabula
            said.</p>

            <p>But Dabula also said that some initiation schools
            today were corrupt and cruel places that were in no way
            representative of African traditions.</p>

            <p>"What use to happen before is that, firstly, the
            surgeon who was chosen by the family was an experienced
            person who had undergone supervisory work.</p>

            <p>"The second thing... is that experienced people
            looked after the wound. Those people were called
            amakhankatha. Amakhankatha today are not
            experienced.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">"The problem with today's
            schools is that they are more than anything a place of
            vengeance. <a href="/library/psych/vanderkolk/">People
            who got beaten to a pulp in their day are there to
            inflict upon others the treatment they got</a>,"</span>
            Dabula said.</p>
