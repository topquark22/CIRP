            <h2>Some Health Care Bills Made It, Some Didn't</h2>

            <p>Health and Human Services: The state's four
            preschool programs for children with autism, which were
            targeted to lose all $1.6 million in state funding
            early in the session, were spared the ax.<br />
             The Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS) will
            get $1.9 million to hire 51 new caseworkers and
            trainers in response to a legislative audit and threats
            by a federal judge to order allocation of the money to
            comply with a decade-old lawsuit.<br />
             The Foster Care Citizen Review Board, which reviews
            the cases of every child in DCFS custody, lost half its
            budget -- a cut of $320,000.<br />
             Despite $1 million in new funding, a budget shortfall
            in the Baby Watch Early Intervention Program, which
            serves kids under 3 who are developmentally delayed,
            could force services to be pulled from infants and
            toddlers.<br />
             Also, about 2,125 fewer people will receive mental
            health and substance abuse treatment because of a $1.5
            million cutback in the budget for the Division of
            Substance Abuse and Mental Health.<br />
             -- Jacob Santini</p>

            <p>Medicaid, Children's Insurance: Lawmakers restored
            much of the Medicaid budget, a move that prevented
            6,000 people from losing their health care coverage.
            Lawmakers also restored Medicaid funding for physical
            therapy and audiology.<br />
             But dental and vision services, excluding children and
            pregnant women, were not restored. <span
            class="yellow">Lawmakers eliminated Medicaid-funded
            circumcisions.</span><br />
             -- Jacob Santini</p>

            <p>Preventative Preventive Health Care: For the fourth
            year, Sen. Paula Julander, D-Salt Lake City, tried and
            failed to get her colleagues to support a law requiring
            health insurance policies offered in the state to cover
            a handful of preventive health tests and
            treatments.<br />
             The bill covered tests and treatments for osteoporosis
            and prostate, breast, cervical, colon and colorectal
            cancers. Also included were prescriptive
            contraceptives, with an exception for a "religious
            employer" to opt out of such coverage.<br />
             -- Jacob Santini</p>

            <p>Residential Treatment: If it becomes law, substitute
            House Bill 137 will allow cities and counties to
            exclude a residential treatment center if it "would
            likely create a fundamental change in the character of
            a neighborhood."<br />
             The measure also would allow local governments to
            limit the number of occupants at such centers.<br />
             -- Leo Tyson Dirr</p>

            <p>Smallpox Liability: House Bill 160 was passed and
            signed into law to protect Utah's public health
            agencies from liability in cases of side effects from
            the smallpox vaccine. The law was needed to begin
            smallpox vaccinations among a small group of Utah
            public health workers.<br />
            </p>

            <p>Fluoride: House Bill 64 passed, requiring any votes
            on removing fluoride from municipal water supplies to
            be held at least four years after a vote that approved
            the addition of the substance. Under the law, the
            earliest a vote could be held to remove fluoride from
            water would be November 2004. Salt Lake area water
            suppliers are slated to begin adding fluoride in
            October.</p>
