            <h2>Circumcision Not Effective In Preventing HIV Among
            MSM, Study Finds</h2>

            <p>Despite research showing circumcision can reduce a
            man's risk of HIV during heterosexual intercourse, a
            study published Wednesday in the <i>Journal of the
            American Medical Association</i> found that the
            procedure offers little protection against the virus
            for men who have sex with men, AFP/Yahoo! News reports.
            According to the study, there was minimal difference in
            HIV infections between those MSM who were circumcised
            and those who were not (AFP/Yahoo! News, 10/7).<br />
            <br />
             For the study, researchers at CDC, led by Gregorio
            Millett, reviewed 15 previous studies on circumcision
            that included 53,567 MSM from Australia, Great Britain,
            Canada, India, the Netherlands, Peru, Taiwan and the
            U.S. Circumcised MSM were 14% less likely to be
            HIV-positive than those who were not, a rate that was
            not statistically significant, according to the
            researchers. Millett said, "You can't necessarily say
            with confidence that we're seeing a true effect there,"
            adding, "Overall, we're not finding a protective effect
            associated with circumcision" for MSM (Dunham, Reuters,
            10/7).<br />
            <br />
             However, when examining studies carried out before the
            introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in
            1996, the researchers found evidence that circumcision
            in the past had a protective effect for MSM, BBC News
            reports. The researchers said one explanation for the
            reduced effectiveness of circumcision among MSM
            following the introduction of HAART is that the
            efficacy of drugs diminished the perceived need to
            practice safer sex to avoid contracting HIV. In
            addition, the study noted that HAART might help reduce
            the risk of HIV transmission to a level that
            circumcision does not provide further benefits. The
            researchers also said that there may have been a
            smaller proportion of men in the pre-HAART trials who
            engaged primarily in receptive anal sex, which carries
            the greatest risk of HIV among MSM (BBC News,
            10/7).<br />
            <br />
             CDC's Peter Kilmarx, who was not involved in the
            study, said the agency is set to release a draft of
            formal recommendations on circumcision early next year.
            Although Millett said circumcision cannot be
            recommended as a strategy for HIV prevention among MSM
            in the U.S., he added that there are signs the
            procedure could protect certain MSM depending on sexual
            practices. For example, Millett said that studies in
            Australia and Peru have shown that men who engaged only
            in insertive anal sex and were not being penetrated by
            male sex partners experienced a greater level of
            protection from circumcision (Reuters, 10/7). However,
            Millett said, "Even if we find that insertive men are
            protected, that might be such a small proportion that
            we wouldn't get the effect on the overall population
            that we'd like. As it stands now, circumcision is
            unlikely to have the same kind of benefit [in the U.S.]
            that it's projected to have in Africa" (Lauerman,
            Bloomberg, 10/7).<br />
            <br />
             According to the authors, more research might be
            needed to determine the amount of protection provided
            by circumcision for insertive MSM (AFP/Yahoo! News,
            10/7). "These studies weren't designed to answer this
            question in the first place, and it's possible that
            they're too varied to show an effect," Millet said,
            adding, "The idea makes sense, but there just aren't
            enough data out there right now to show whether there's
            a benefit" (Bloomberg, 10/7). In a related editorial
            also published in JAMA, a team of peer reviewers from
            Vanderbilt University wrote that "circumcision would
            likely be insufficiently efficient to be universally
            effective in reducing HIV and will have to be combined
            with other prevention modalities to have a substantial
            and sustained prevention effect" (AFP/Yahoo! News,
            10/7).<br />
