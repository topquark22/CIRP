            <h2>CIRCUMCISION, RATES DECLINING</h2>

            <p>Once a widely accepted procedure among American
            doctors, male circumcision has experienced a steady
            decline in the last few decades.</p>

            <p>Circumcision of newborns peaked in the United States
            some 30 years ago at about 85 percent to 90 percent,
            says Dr George Denniston, president of <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>, a
            Seattle based-anti-circumcision organization with
            members worldwide. These, days, those numbers are
            around 55-60 percent, he says. The rates are even lower
            In the western states of California, Oregon and
            Washington, which have a combined rate of 35 percent,
            Denniston adds. Some states also have stopped covering
            circumcisions under Medicaid.</p>

            <p>Denniston attributes the decline to increased
            awareness among parents of what he considers a
            dangerous, needless, procedure.</p>

            <p>"It doesn't take anybody with an IQ over 70 to
            realize that taking off half the skin of a normal penis
            causes problems," Denniston says. "There's not a single
            medical association in the entire world that approves
            routine infant circumcision."</p>

            <p>Others, however, point to studies showing the
            benefits of circumcision. These include reduced risk
            for urinary tract infections in babies and penile
            cancer in older men, and potential benefits in
            preventing HIV.</p>

            <p>Then there are the religious and cultural reasons
            behind the procedure.</p>

            <p>"It's a ritual that celebrates the covenant into the
            Jewish (religion)," says Rabbi Myra Soifer of Temple
            Sinai in Reno, Nev. "Its central to the Jewish faith
            because that's how Abraham came into the covenant as
            the first Jew and agreed to the foundation and
            theological commitment that is now Judaism."</p>

            <p>MEDICAL MATTERS<br />
            No one can quite peg the origins of circumcision, which
            dates back even further than Biblical accounts of
            Abraham, according to the online Circumcision
            Information and Resource Page.</p>

            <p>"It's one of those things that have been done for a
            long time and nobody even knows why it started,"
            Denniston says.</p>

            <p>In the, 1800s, circumcisions were encouraged by some
            doctors in the United States as a way to prevent boys
            from masturbating. These days, the touted benefits for
            circumcision are more grounded in science than the
            masturbation-induced madness and eternal damnation that
            old proponents used to warn people about.</p>

            <p>A common advantage mentioned is easier hygiene,
            although this is more a convenience factor and not a
            pressing need, says Dr. Catherine Wagoner, a
            pediatrician. <a href="/library/hygiene/">Proper
            hygiene</a>, or the lack thereof, might be considered
            as an indication for circumcision in men who are either
            too old or unable to properly clean underneath the
            foreskin, since this can cause infections, Wagoner
            says.</p>

            <p>Circumcision also is used to treat <a
            href="/library/treatment/phimosis/">phimosis</a>, a
            rare condition in which the foreskin is too tight to be
            pulled back. In some cases, this condition can restrict
            blood flow to the head of the penis.</p>

            <p>Studies show that babies who are circumcised have a
            significantly lower risk for urinary-tract infections
            during their first year - about a one in 1,000 chance
            as opposed to one in 100 for their uncircumcised
            counterparts. Some studies also show increased
            protection against genital warts and <a
            href="/library/disease/STD/">sexually transmitted
            diseases</a> such as gonorrhea and syphilis, and a
            reduced risk of penile cancer in men and cervical
            cancer in female partners.</p>

            <p>One of the strongest findings for circumcision's
            benefits appeared 'in the June 10, 2000, issue of the
            British Medical Journal. The study found that
            circumcised men are two to eight times less likely to
            contract HIV through sex. Researchers said the likely
            culprits were cells with HlV receptors found in the
            inner surface of the foreskin. Although stopping short
            of recommending routine male infant circumcision, the
            researchers went on to suggest circumcision an
            additional means of preventing infection, especially
            those in central and southern Africa.</p>

            <p>"BENEFITS" DISMISSED<br />
            Anti-circumcision advocates, though, are quick to
            dismiss the mentioned benefits.</p>

            <p>Hygiene, for one, shouldn't be a problem as long as
            boys are taught how to clean underneath the foreskin
            properly, Denniston says. Urinary tract infections also
            should be treated just like any infection - with
            medication, not by cutting off the foreskin, he added.
            And as far as phimosis goes, even the worst cases
            should be treatable by regularly stretching the
            foreskin, he says. Denniston also dismisses the studies
            about circumcisions medical benefits as inconclusive,
            adding that a study has yet to come out with strong
            enough findings to recommend routine routine infant
            ciremcision.</p>

            <p>For some, that is an argument that cuts both
            ways.</p>

            <p>If you look at the reseach there's no reason to do
            it or not to do it," Wagoner says.</p>

            <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics mirrors Wagoner's
            view. in its circumcision policy released in 1999, the
            AAP states that circumcision does have some potential
            health benefits, although those benefits aren't
            significant enough to recommend routine circumcision.
            The AAP went on to say that the decision for
            circumcision ultimately rests on parents, a neutral
            stance that ultimately doesn't forbid or encourage the
            procedure.</p>

            <p>POLITICS COME INTO PLAY</p>

            <p>For Denniston, the AAP response is largely
            political.</p>

            <p>"The AAP said the data is not sufficient to
            recommend routine circumcision," Denniston says.
            "Either data is sufficient or insufficient ... but they
            go on to waffle because it's a 'CYA' operation - Cover
            Your Ass. If they said it absolutely shouldn't be done,
            then they open their members for lawsuits. They're
            trying to ease their way out of this."</p>

            <p>Cultural Decisions:</p>

            <p>With the medical debate for circumcision raging to a
            standoff, the driving force behind circumcision now
            largely rests on two factors- culture and religion.</p>

            <p>For anti-circumcision advocates, these could be the
            biggest roadblocks of all.</p>

            <p>People like Denniston, for example, cite <a
            href="/library/pain/taddio2/">psychological damage to
            infants due to pain</a> and to boys who realize "they
            aren't whole" when they first learn about their
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>In some cases, though, not being circumcised also
            opens a boy to the same psychological trauma due to
            ridicule from circumcised peers. This is especially
            worse for boys in cultures that traditionally
            circumcise their adolescents as a rite of passage to
            manhood.</p>

            <p>Soifer whose religion has been practicing
            circumcision for thousands of years, also doesn't agree
            with the way anti-circumcision proponents portray the
            procedure as being highly dangerous.</p>

            <p>"Some doctors raise issues of psychology and, of
            course, none of us can ever really know what's going on
            inside the head of a tiny baby," Soifer says. "I think
            there are a lot of questions one can raise about
            circumcision but I think the fact that it's medically
            dangerous is not factually verifiable."</p>

            <p>APPEARANCE A FACTOR<br />
            Some don't even need reasons of higher purpose, such as
            culture and religion. For others, the preference for
            circumcision boils down to good, old looks - not just
            in the eyes of men but for female partners as well.</p>

            <p>With many women, the preference doesn't stop there.
            Even Denniston, who says that circumcised males feel
            less sexual pleasure because of the removal of the
            highly sensitive foreskin, admits that there is a
            common view among women in the United States that sex
            with a circumcised penis feels better.</p>

            <p>"It's in the eye of the beholder," says Denniston,
            adding that the perceived extra pleasure is likely
            psychological.</p>

            <p>With the medical debate at a standstill and the
            strong influence of religion and culture, circumcision
            in the United States will likely stay at the near 50-50
            split it's been hovering at lately. For people like
            Wagoner, that isn't exactly a bad thing.</p>

            <p>"You can go through your whole life either
            circumcised or uncircumcised and be completely fine,"
            Wagoner said. "It still remains a parent's choice."</p>
