            <h2>Circumcision service has to secure funding</h2>

            <p>By Aileen Mulhall</p>

            <p>A REPORT has recommended that circumcisions of male
            babies for religious or cultural grounds be carried out
            at Waterford Regional Hospital, but the new service
            won&rsquo;t be introduced until it secures Department
            of Health funding.</p>

            <p>The report has been produced by an internal <a
            href="http://www.sehb.ie/" target="_blank">South
            Eastern Health Board</a> committee set up following the
            <a href="/news/irishtimes08-21-03/">tragic death of a
            29 day-old baby Callis Osaghae</a> in Waterford last
            August due to a botched illegal domestic
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>South Eastern Health Board spokesperson Audrey
            Lambourn said the Health Board will have to obtain
            funding for the new regional service before it can be
            introduced at Waterford Regional Hospital.</p>

            <p>The funding will be required to finance the
            circumcision surgical procedures, the medical
            personnel, who will carry them out, and post-operative
            care facilities. According to the report, the
            circumcisions will be carried out under general
            anaesthesia by a surgeon with training and experience
            in this area.</p>

            <p>100 CHILDREN</p>

            <p>The internal committee estimates a maximum of 100
            children a year from the region will require
            circumcisions on cultural and religious grounds.</p>

            <p>It points out that the majority of these children
            will be from refugee/asylum families, who are not in a
            position to seek medical intervention.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;If the Health Board does not provide a
            service, they will continue to access individuals, who
            lack the experience and expertise.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;The procedures will be carried out in an
            unsafe environment with the consequences we have
            witnessed,&rdquo; the committee concluded.</p>

            <p>The SEHB group made its recommendation that the
            Health Board provide a regional circumcision service at
            WRH in the absence of national guidelines on
            circumcisions for religious or cultural reasons.</p>

            <p>A group, chaired by Prof. Denis Gill of the <a
            href="http://www.rcsi.ie/">Royal College of
            Surgeons</a>, is currently drawing up these national
            guidelines in this area for the <a
            href="http://www.doh.ie/" target="_blank">Department of
            Health and Children</a>.</p>

            <p>The SEHB report states the medical conditions, which
            require a circumcision to be carried out in childhood
            or later are rare.</p>

            <p>INFRINGEMENT</p>

            <p>It points out that male circumcision is considered
            by many Jewish and Islamic people to be essential to
            the practice of their religion and they would regard
            any restriction or ban on male circumcision as an
            infringement of their basic fundamental rights.</p>

            <p>According to the report the majority of people from
            Africa, irrespective of their religion request
            circumcision for their children for cultural reasons
            and points out that the baby boy, who died in Waterford
            following a botched domestic circumcision last August,
            was an African Christian.</p>
