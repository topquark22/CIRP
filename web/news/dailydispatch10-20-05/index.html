            <h4>While some parents helped, others hid the boys to
            stop their being removed by the department</h4>

            <p>By MODISE KABELI and LULAMILE FENI</p>

            <p>HEALTH Department officials rescued more than 5000
            initiates from illegal initiation schools in the
            province in this year's circumcision season.</p>

            <p>A total of 10685 boys in the province entered the
            traditional rite of passage ritual last season between
            the beginning of June and the end of July.</p>

            <p>During this period 23 initiates died, 15 of them of
            natural causes.</p>

            <p>Under the Application of Health Standards in
            Traditional Circumcision Act, circumcision schools have
            to be registered with the <a href=""
            target="_blank">Health Department</a>.</p>

            <p>Initiates who intend undergoing the ritual must have
            a medical examination and be registered with a local
            health official.</p>

            <p>These moves were designed by the department to
            ensure the traditional practice - which has claimed
            many lives due to infection - is made safer.</p>

            <p>But the recent crackdown by the department has
            revealed how extensively this law is still flouted in
            some areas.</p>

            <p>Provincial <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/department_overview.asp?departmentID=4"
             target="_blank">Health Department</a> spokesperson
            Sizwe Kupelo said the state had established that there
            were 3316 legal and 880 illegal initiation schools
            across the province in the last season.</p>

            <p>About 240 of the illegal schools were in the OR
            Tambo region including Mthatha, Lusikisiki, and
            Libode.</p>

            <p>Most initiates rescued were schoolboys as young as
            12 years old from the Pondoland region in Transkei,
            where initiation is most problematic.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Kupelo said about 268 initiates
            in the OR Tambo region alone were admitted to hospital
            after complications following circumcision.</span></p>

            <p>"If it were not for our intervention about 500
            initiates could have died and hundreds of others could
            have lost their manhood," Kupelo said.</p>

            <p>Most of the initiates rescued during the campaign by
            his department in collaboration with the traditional
            leaders and police had no complications and were in the
            care of their parents and local chiefs, he said.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said some initiates were found neglected,
            dehydrated and hungry.</p>

            <p>While some concerned parents assisted in rescuing
            their children, others hid the initiates to stop them
            from being removed by the department.</p>

            <p>The <a
            href="http://www.sahrc.org.za/sahrc_cms/publish/cat_index_26.shtml"
             target="_blank">Human Rights Commission</a> said the
            Health Department's statistics painted a shocking
            picture.</p>

            <p>HRC provincial head Sakhele Poswa said the trend
            showed that both the health and education rights of the
            children were violated and that the Act was not
            effective.</p>

            <p>The chairman of the provincial House of Traditional
            Leaders, Chief Ngangomhlaba Matanzima, was also
            shocked.</p>

            <p>But he said that the campaign by traditional
            leaders, the department and others, concerned with
            keeping initiation ceremonies safe had saved many
            lives.</p>

            <p>He said if the local chief, and not the health
            department, were allowed to allocate the initiation
            site, there would be fewer illegal surgeons and
            schools.</p>

            <p>Matanzima said he was fining every community member
            in his area who sent a boy to initiation school without
            having permission from traditional leaders.</p>

            <p>Libode police investigator, Inspector Mziseni
            Mlahlwa, who works with the Health Department in
            arresting illegal surgeons and nurses, said he had
            recently arrested three surgeons in the area and their
            cases were pending.</p>

            <p>He said about seven boys in the Libode area had
            their genitals amputated recently after attending
            illegal schools.</p>

            <p>Hambisilizwi Mdikane, the Health Department's
            initiation co-ordinator in the OR Tambo district,
            described one of the horrifying scenes he encountered
            at an illegal initiation school.</p>

            <p>"(An) initiate with his whole body swollen and
            painful refused to be taken to hospital because of the
            stigma (of not completing the ritual).</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">"When we finally persuaded him
            he died at the hospital two days later," Mdikane
            said.</span></p>

            <p>The department is now using 30 4x4 vehicles, 10
            sedans and three helicopters to monitor remote
            initiation schools.</p>

            <p>About 400 officers from the department have been
            assigned to do the work and the department would also
            start registering would-be initiates at Education
            Department schools across the province.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said Health MEC Monwabisi Goqwana will be
            requesting a meeting with the Director of Public
            Prosecutions to design a joint strategy that will help
            improve the conviction rate of illegal surgeons. Kupelo
            also appealed to the community to assist his department
            in its efforts to curb problems plaguing the practice
            of circumcision.</p>
