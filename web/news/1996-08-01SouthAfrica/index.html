class="yellow">He was charged with two counts of murder.</span>

    Mr Mbalo was not asked to plead and no evidence was led. Her was
not defended. The trial was postponed to August 8 and he was granted
bail of R1 000.

    Police have reported that five "abakwetha" died and about 60
suffered organ mutilations with eight of them having to undergo
genital amputations.

    Mr Mbalo was arrested on Monday night.

    Kokstad regional health director Chauke Tyekela said 62 initiates

*****************************

COMMENT: "Abakwetha" is Xhosa for "initiates", i.e. from after
circumcision till the re-emergence into society.
