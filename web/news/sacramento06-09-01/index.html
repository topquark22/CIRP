      <h2>Boy awarded $1.42 million for botched circumcision</h2>

      <p><i>(Published June 9, 2001)</i></p>

      <p>SACRAMENTO -- A Sacramento jury awarded $1.42 million to a
      7-year-old boy this week for a botched circumcision performed
      by a first-year resident at the UC Davis Medical Center.The
      verdict exceeds the legal cap of $250,000 on medical
      malpractice awards because the hospital failed to obtain the
      parents' permission to operate.The child was 5 days old when
      he underwent the surgery in 1994.</p>

      <p>Martin Blake, the parents' attorney, said the boy suffered
      from a pituitary condition that made circumcision difficult
      and dangerous."He will have to undergo multiple surgeries
      when he is an adolescent," Blake said.</p>

      <p>Carole Gan, a spokeswoman for <a
      href="http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">UC Davis
      Health System</a>, said UC Davis does not agree with the
      verdict and is considering an appeal." We believe the parents
      clearly consented to the procedure prior to surgery," Gan
      said. "We regret that this particular surgery did not go as
      well as planned."<br />
