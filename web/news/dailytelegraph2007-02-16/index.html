            circumcision</h2>

            <p><b>By Martin Beckford</b><br />
             Last Updated: 2:04am GMT 16/02/2007</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Detectives are investigating
            the death of a baby boy who stopped breathing minutes
            after he was circumcised.</span> Amitai Moshe, then
            just seven days old, became ill while still at the
            north London synagogue where the ceremony had been
            performed. He was taken to a nearby hospital but died
            the following week. Initial tests suggest that he
            suffered a fatal heart attack.</p>

            <p>Jewish leaders have stressed that no link has been
            found between the circumcision ritual and Amitai's
            death.</p>

            <p>However, police are treating the incident as
            unexplained and have appointed detectives from the
            Metropolitan Police Serious Crime Directorate, which
            includes child abuse investigators, to
            investigate.</p>

            <p>Last night Amitai's father Ran, 32, and mother
            Yotvat, 30, were too distraught to talk about their
            son's death. Amitai's grandmother, speaking from the
            family's home in Golders Green, said: "It is a very bad
            time for them."</p>

            <p>Neighbours in the close-knit Jewish community said
            they were supporting the couple, who also have a young
            daughter. One woman said: "It's a very sad tragedy and
            we're all helping them."</p>

            <p>Amitai was born on Jan 25 and was circumcised a week
            later at the <a href="http://www.ggbh.org.uk/"
            target="_blank">Golders Green synagogue</a> by a
            registered practitioner of the operation, known as a
            <i>Mohel</i>.</p>

            <p>Jewish baby boys traditionally undergo the ceremony,
            known as the <i>Bris Milah</i>, on the eighth day of
            their lives. The foreskin of the penis is removed, to
            symbolise the Jewish boy entering into a covenant with
            God, followed by a naming ceremony.</p>

            <p>But 15 minutes after Amitai was circumcised he
            stopped breathing and emergency services were called.
            He was taken to the <a
            href="http://www.royalfree.org.uk/"
            target="_blank">Royal Free Hospital</a> and later
            transferred to <a href="http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/"
            target="_blank">University College Hospital</a> in
            central London, where he died last Friday.</p>

            <p>A post mortem examination gave the initial cause of
            death as cardiac arrest and starvation of oxygen to the
            brain.</p>

            <p>An inquest into Amitai's death was opened and
            adjourned at Hornsey coroner's court yesterday. The
            coroner will review the case in a fortnight after
            further tests.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.met.police.uk/"
            target="_blank">Scotland Yard</a> said: "Police are
            investigating the circumstances of the death of a baby
            boy. Inquiries are being carried out by officers from
            the Serious Crime Directorate. The death is being
            treated as unexplained."</p>

            <p>A spokesman for Hornsey coroner's court said: "The
            child abuse investigation team is investigating the
            circumstances. A post mortem revealed a possible cause
            of death but this is to be confirmed after further
            tests."</p>

            <p>A spokesman for the <a href="http://www.bod.org.uk/"
            target="_blank">Board of Deputies of British Jews</a>,
            the body that represents British Jews, insisted that
            circumcision was safe and that there was no suggestion
            that Amitai had died because of the procedure.</p>

            <p>He said: "We are deeply saddened by the event. There
            were absolutely no problems at the time of the
            circumcision and it was about 15 minutes afterwards
            that it was noticed there were some breathing
            difficulties."</p>

            <p>No causal connection has been established between
            the circumcision and Amitai's death. It was carried out
            by a <i>Mohel</i> who is a registered member of the <a
            href="http://www.initiationsociety.org/"
            target="_blank">Initiation Society</a>, which has been
            regulating and training them for over 200 years.</p>

            <p>"Over 2,000 circumcisions of baby boys are carried
            out in Britain every year. It is a very established,
            regulated practice in terms of medical training. This
            was an unfortunate juxtaposition of two events."</p>
