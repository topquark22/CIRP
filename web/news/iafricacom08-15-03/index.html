            <h2>Circumcision slammed as 'barbarism'</h2>
            Posted Fri, 15 Aug 2003 

            <p>The <a
            href="http://www.inasp.org.uk/ajol/journals/sam/index.html">
            South African Medical Journal</a> has condemned what it
            calls the "barbarism" practised on boys in the name of
            traditional circumcision rituals.</p>

            <p>"Many of the so-called circumcision schools of today
            are fake, and deadly," says SAMJ editor Daniel
            Ncayiyana in the latest edition of the journal.</p>

            <p>"They have very little to do with the traditional
            ethos and practice of this ancient ritual, and
            something must be done to stop the carnage."</p>

            <p>His call comes in the wake of a fresh crop of deaths
            and mutilations caused by traditional-style
            circumcisions.</p>

            <p><a href="/news/thestar07-16-02/">In the Eastern Cape
            alone this winter, 25 initiates died, 16 had to have
            their penises amputated and 92 were admitted to
            hospitals.</a></p>

            <p>Ncayiyana said that anywhere else in the world this
            kind of "mayhem" would have evoked community outrage
            and urgent and drastic action to stop it.</p>

            <p>"Why are we not sufficiently agitated by the
            slaughter to find ways to stop it?" he asked.</p>

            <p>He said the ritual had traditionally been about
            preparing youngsters for the challenges of manhood in
            the rural world in which they lived, and had been
            performed by experienced operators and overseen by the
            community.</p>

            <p>However, a researcher in the Limpopo province had
            found that of late, the practice had degenerated into a
            money-making exercise for those running the schools,
            and that boys as young as six years were admitted.</p>

            <p>Malpractices include gratuitous beatings and other
            forms of physical abuse, extreme exposure to the
            elements, nutritional deprivation and the withholding
            of medicines from the chronically ill.</p>

            <p>Ncayiyana said all schools should be registered, all
            circumcisors be required to undergo training and
            certification, and all circumcision venues should pass
            inspection.</p>

            <p>These three steps would see many lives saved and the
            ritual of circumcision "regain its traditional
            dignity".</p>

            <p><a href="/news/eastcapenews10-25-01/">The Eastern
            Cape enacted legislation on circumcision two years
            ago</a>, while a similar regulatory bill has been
            introduced in the Free State.</p>
