            deaths</h2>

            <p><b>By Samkelo Ngwenya</b></p>

            <p>MDANTSANE -- Traditional surgeons from around here
            have embarked on a community awareness campaign to try
            to end the high circumcision death rate of the past
            season.</p>

            <p><span>Twenty-nine initiates have died in the Eastern
            Cape since June from botched circumcisions.</span></p>

            <p>Buffalo City Traditional Circumcision Association
            co-ordinator Vuyani Sijako said that a campaign meeting
            this week went smoothly. "We don't want to see any
            deaths or hospitalised boys next summer," he said.</p>

            <p>"We are registering all traditional surgeons and
            teaching them about the new law on circumcision,"
            Sijako said.</p>

            <p>A total of 132 initiates, as young as 12, have been
            admitted to provincial hospitals suffering from
            complications arising from circumcisions.</p>

            <p>This led to 22 traditional surgeons (ingibi) and
            nurses (amakhankatha) being arrested and charged with
            contravening the law governing circumcision.</p>

            <p>The number of dead due to botched circumcisions in
            the province was more than four times that of last year
            when six initiates died and 74 were admitted to
            hospitals.</p>

            <p>"We want to persuade parents not to allow boys to
            undergo circumcision without a medical examination,"
            Sijako said.</p>

            <p>"Parents must not allow unregistered traditional
            surgeons and traditional nurses to handle their sons,"
            he said.</p>

            <p>The government passed a circumcision law nine months
            ago to curb deaths among initiates.</p>

            <p>According to the Application of Health Standards in
            Traditional Circumcision Act, no person --except a
            recognised traditional medical practitioner -- may
            perform a circumcision without the permission of a
            medical officer designated for the area.</p>

            <p>A circumcision school may not be held or initiates
            treated without written permission of the medical
            officer.</p>

            <p>Penalties for not complying with various sections of
            the law range from a fine of R1000, or imprisonment not
            exceeding six months, to R10000, or imprisonment not
            exceeding 10 years.</p>

            <p>A follow-up meeting will be held in Mdantsane next
            Monday.</p>
