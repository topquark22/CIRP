      <p>In a move to curb Xhosa initiate deaths and mutilations
      the Health Department would employ experienced iincgibi
      (traditional surgeons) to perform circumcisions said <a
      href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/structure/department/health2/overview.htm"
      target="_blank">Eastern Cape Health Department</a>
      spokesperson Mahlubandile Magida yesterday.</p>

      <p>Magida said in a bid to get of "chance-takers" who were
      motivated by greed, the Health Department was in the process
      of formulating payment for certified iingcibi. "Soon after
      the passing of the Circumcision Bill in September we want
      communities to have already identified and chosen skilled
      iingcibi they trust." The circumcision bill seeks to regulate
      and introduce accountability to the custom. "By December the
      chosen iingcibi will be in our books." He said regional
      committees would be set up to oversee the process.</p>

      <p>A committee was already operating in Libode identifying
      "real iingcibi". The Department would not train or retrain
      iingcibi as it would be too expensive. Magida said the chosen
      iingcibi would be paid during the June and December
      initiation periods. "They can't be paid on a monthly basis
      because initiation does not happen monthly." He said
      everybody, including traditional leaders, councillors, and
      the community, should help curb the "terrible tragedy" of
      initiate deaths and mutilations.<br />
