            <p><i><u>By Paula Mavroudis - The Daily
            Iowan</u></i></p>
            12/5/02 

            <p>UI freshman Neil Peterson grew up convinced that he
            was no different from other boys even though he spent
            much of those years in excruciating pain.</p>

            <p>The Missouri native experienced uncomfortable
            erections from early childhood until two years ago,
            when the 24-year-old anthropology student discovered
            that he suffered from a rare complication after being
            circumcised too tightly. Since then, he's spoken out
            about the procedure and formed a local chapter of
            Students for Genital Integrity, a nationwide support
            group.</p>

            <p>"I had to recognize that I was unhappy the way I
            was," he said. "[Forming the group] was a very
            un-American thing for me to do, because society
            normalcy calls for circumcision in men. It has healed
            me to talk about it."</p>

            <p>Peterson said his complication was healed after he
            learned to stretch his foreskin out to alleviate his
            condition. Although he no longer experiences pain, he
            is dedicated to speaking out against genital
            mutilation.</p>

            <p>Circumcision and other types of bodily mutilation
            are crimes against human rights, Peterson said. His
            group contends that children should not be forcibly
            circumcised, as they now are as infants at their
            parents' request. The group is dedicated to educating
            the public and doctors that circumcision is not
            necessary, in addition to highlighting the dangers of
            sex-reassignnemt surgery to distinguish hermaphrodites
            as male or female.</p>

            <p>The group will be formally recognized as a UI
            student organization next week, Peterson said.</p>

            <p>Peterson is planning to hold fund-raisers and host
            speakers at the university and write to
            representatives, expressing the need for a law barring
            circumcision in the United States.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.cirp.org/">Circumcision
            Information and Resource Pages</a> reports that
            approximately 60 percent of American males are
            circumcised, down from nearly 90 percent in the
            1960s.</p>

            <p>Edward Bell, a UI professor of pediatrics, said
            complications such as Peterson's are extremely rare.
            The American Academy of Pediatrics says 0.2 to 0.6
            percent of circumcisions end with complications.
            Bleeding and infection are two problems that can occur
            when a boy is circumcised, as well as scarring if the
            doctor removes too much foreskin, Bell said.</p>

            <p>Jewish children are supposed to be circumcised for
            religious reasons, though Iowa City Rabbi Jeff Portman
            said he wouldn't regard an uncircumcised Jewish boy as
            any less Jewish.</p>

            <p>"I know parents who have refused to have their
            children circumcised because they've seen the studies,"
            he said.</p>

            <p>While Chicago medical researchers suggested in a
            study published in the American Journal of Pathology
            earlier this year that uncircumcised men are at a
            higher risk for contracting HIV, Bell said that
            circumcision has become an unnecessary procedure for
            most males.</p>

            <p>"Circumcision is more of a cultural issue than a
            medical one," he said. "It would be nice if parents
            didn't insist upon having their boys circumcised."</p>

            <p>Many parents don't want their boys to look different
            from their brothers, peers, or fathers, Bell said.</p>

            <p>Peterson and Bell's stance on the issue got a small
            boost from the pediatrics academy in 1999, when it
            released a policy telling doctors that the benefits of
            circumcision are not strong enough to mandate it as
            necessary.</p>

            <p>"Circumcision has become cosmetic surgery, and it's
            really just a matter of personal preference," Bell
            said.</p>

            <p>Leaving the foreskin, however, brings specific
            problems of its own. A rare condition known as
            phimosis, caused by the foreskin being too tight around
            the shaft of the penis, can occur in about 2 percent of
            men, reported the Circumcision Information and Resource
            Pages, and result in excruciating pain. More commonly,
            an uncircumcised man may experience bladder infections,
            Bell said.</p>
