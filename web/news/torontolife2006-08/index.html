            <h4>Some guys are willing to go through crazy
            contortions to reverse their circumcisions&mdash;
            taping, stretching, tugging, even surgery. A look at
            the ins and outs of foreskin restoration</h4>

            <p><b>by Veronica Cusack</b></p>

            </center>

            <p>Alex* stands naked at the bathroom mirror, his
            supplies arrayed neatly on the vanity before him: two
            small suspender clips sewn onto a length of wide
            elastic, a Crayola washable marker and a T-shaped strip
            of tape. It&rsquo;s one of a dozen or so strips
            fashioned from waxed butcher paper and 3M surgical tape
            that Alex prepared at the kitchen table the night
            before, much as his mother once assembled batches of
            pierogies to sustain the family throughout the
            week.</p>

            <p>Alex is a 31-year-old financial consultant, but in
            his wide blue eyes and apple-red cheeks you can still
            see the pampered blithesome baby, the first-born son of
            parents anxious to do the right thing, to make him look
            just like Daddy. He grasps the base of his penis and
            pushes the shaft skin, limited though it is, forward
            until it folds, then marks the crease with Crayola
            dots. He positions the T-tape over the markings, wraps
            it around the glans, or head, and clips the end of the
            tape onto the elastic strap. He then loops the strap
            over his shoulder, thus pulling his penis tightly
            across his stomach&mdash;not hard enough to hurt, but
            enough to keep the skin taut, as it will remain for the
            next 10 hours. Alex&rsquo;s business suit hides all
            evidence of the contraption. He kisses his wife goodbye
            in his quiet Oakville home and drives away, with only a
            slight adjustment to the strapping as he starts his
            commute to Bay Street.</p>

            <p>This is not simply one young man&rsquo;s singular
            fetish, but a serious, long-term attempt at
            restoration&mdash;Alex is trying to regrow his foreskin
            by stretching it. He has maintained his routine for 18
            months and hopes another two years will be enough to
            complete the process. A decade ago, foreskin
            restoration was dismissed as a &ldquo;San Francisco
            fad,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s no longer a fringe
            phenomenon. Across the GTA and over much of the world,
            men are mirroring Alex&rsquo;s schedule. Most restorers
            seem to favour a variation on the taping method, but
            they can also choose from one of a growing number of
            commercial de&shy;vices with such brand names as
            Foreballs, the TLC Tugger, PUD (penile uncircumcising
            device) and Tug Ahoy (its grip strength demonstrated by
            an alarming Web site photo showing two one-gallon jugs
            of milk hanging from a muscular fellow&rsquo;s member
            and the comment that it&rsquo;s not only comfortable
            but feels &ldquo;really good!&rdquo;). Surgery is also
            an option, but it can cost $10,000 or more, and tales
            of resultant scarring and deformity are legion.</p>

            <p>Though no one is keeping official statistics, the
            burgeoning Web presence of forums and chat groups, plus
            advocacy and information sites devoted to restoration,
            suggests that there are tens of thousands of men now at
            some stage of the procedure. Many consider infant
            circumcision a criminal assault and a violation of
            human rights; others are convinced it compromises
            sexual function.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not angry at anyone, as some men
            are,&rdquo; says Alex. &ldquo;I just think this is a
            good thing for me. It&rsquo;s what I want.&rdquo; From
            mild-mannered bankers to strident advocates, these are
            men who keenly regret their physical loss, and
            they&rsquo;re willing to undergo radical measures to be
            &ldquo;natural&rdquo; again.</p>

            <p>Religious and tribal rites aside, the history of
            circumcision is largely a history of sexual desire.
            Rabbi Moses Maimonides, a 12th-century philosopher
            active in the codi&shy;fication of Jewish law, wrote
            that circum&shy;cision &ldquo;has not been prescribed
            with a view to perfecting what is defective
            congenitally, but to perfecting what is defective
            morally&hellip;The fact that circumcision weakens the
            faculty of sexual excitement and sometimes perhaps
            diminishes the pleasure is indubitable.&rdquo;
            Moralists have long condemned extramatrimonial orgasm,
            whether alone or with a partner, but it wasn&rsquo;t
            until the late 1700s that auto-erotic anxiety seized
            the medical profession. Girls and boys were drugged or
            restrained in chastity belts and spiked penile rings
            lest they touch their genitals. In Britain, children
            were circumcised in the vain hope that the procedure
            would reduce &ldquo;amorosity&rdquo; and prevent
            masturbation. The mania crossed the Atlantic, and Dr.
            John Kellogg took up the cause. The influential Corn
            Flakes creator (he believed in bland food, sexual
            abstinence and a daily yogurt enema) felt vital fluids
            were lost during orgasm. In his 1888 medical treatise
            <i>Treatment for Self-Abuse and Its Effects</i>, he
            advised, &ldquo;A remedy for masturbation which is
            almost always successful in small boys is circumcision.
            The operation should be performed by a surgeon without
            administering an anaesthetic, as the brief pain
            attending the operation will have a salutary effect
            upon the mind, especially if it be connected with the
            idea of punishment. In females, the author has found
            the application of pure carbolic acid to the clitoris
            an excellent means of allaying the abnormal
            excitement.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>As immigrants poured in, changing the face of North
            American cities, circumcision became a sign of rank and
            social order, a mark of those who were able to afford
            the benefits of institutionalized medicine. In the new
            culture of cleanliness, the foreskin and its attendant
            smegma were proclaimed harbingers of disease and
            pollution, themselves indications of immorality.
            Tuberculosis, venereal disease and penile cancer could
            all be avoided if only the unclean foreskin was
            snipped.</p>

            <p>It wasn&rsquo;t until 1949 that circumcision
            received its first major medical denunciation, with the
            <i>British Medical Journal</i>&rsquo;s publication of
            Dr. Douglas Gairdner&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a
            href="/library/general/gairdner/">The Fate of the
            Foreskin</a>,&rdquo; in which he revealed an average of
            16 young boys died in Britain each year while under
            anaesthetic, or from hemorrhage or infection after the
            procedure. The Cambridge pediatrician described how the
            foreskin protects the infant glans and urethral opening
            from urine, feces and other dirt. The study also noted
            that an unretracted foreskin, often diagnosed as the
            abnormal condition phimosis, is natural in an infant,
            and separation from the glans is a gradual process that
            can take many years to complete. Britain&rsquo;s newly
            formed National Health Service subsequently refused to
            fund infant circumcision, and rates plummeted
            throughout the British Isles.</p>

            <p>Canada&rsquo;s numbers followed a much gent&shy;ler
            decline. In 1971, Ontario parents were circumcising 60
            per cent of infant boys in hospital immediately after
            birth, but four years later, the <a
            href="http://www.cps.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian
            Paediatric Society</a> cautioned against the
            &ldquo;obsolete operation.&rdquo; Unless deemed
            medically necessary, provincial health plans (with the
            exception of Mani&shy;toba&rsquo;s) stopped paying for
            it. Ten years ago&mdash;looking at the procedure in
            relation to urinary tract infection, STDs, penile and
            cervical cancer, and at surgical complications such as
            infection, hemorrhage and the accidental amputation of
            the glans&mdash;the CPS concluded that
            &ldquo;circum&shy;cision of newborns should not be
            routinely performed.&rdquo; The current Ontario stat
            for infant boy circumcision in hospitals has dropped to
            18 per cent (private procedures are not tabulated).</p>

            <p>Yet still it persists as a surgery in need of a
            rationale. Today&rsquo;s headlines tout circumcision as
            a barrier against HIV, even though the studies are of
            sub-Saharan African populations whose huge infection
            rates suggest major social and cultural differences
            with western countries. Newspapers rarely address the
            paradox of why the U.S. has the highest incidence of
            HIV and STDs of industrialized nations yet the largest
            rate of circumcised males outside of Israel.</p>

            <p>It is only in the last decade that doctors began to
            meticulously study the anatomy of the foreskin.
            Canadian Dr. John R. Taylor published &ldquo;<a
            href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">The Prepuce:
            Specialized Mucosa of the Penis and Its Loss to
            Circumcision</a>&rdquo; in the <i>British Journal of
            Urology</i> in 1996. In that paper, and in further
            studies, he describes the foreskin as the pri&shy;mary
            sensory tissue of the penis, and hypothesizes that the
            &ldquo;ridged band&rdquo; of corrugated mucous membrane
            lining the inner tip of the foreskin triggers deep
            erogenous sensation, erection and ejaculation.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Every man and his dog presumes they already
            know how everything works, and it&rsquo;s a burr under
            the saddle if they&rsquo;re told anything different.
            But this is sexual tissue,&rdquo; says Taylor.
            &ldquo;Most people look at the child and the prepuce
            and say that the prepuce isn&rsquo;t much use for a
            child. Well, the prepuce isn&rsquo;t designed for a
            child, it&rsquo;s designed for an adult and you
            can&rsquo;t look at it in childish terms.&rdquo; His
            studies explain why women who are familiar with both
            the cut and uncut versions of the penis often describe
            the circumcised organ as devoid of subtlety, thrusting
            hard to achieve its aim.</p>

            <p>&rdquo;If a man comes to me for advice on restoring
            the foreskin, I always tell him he&rsquo;s nuts,&rdquo;
            says Dr. Richard Casey, director of the Male Health
            Centres&rsquo; four Ontario clinics, specializing in
            erectile dysfunction and prostate disease.
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a non-issue.&rdquo; Irreverent,
            direct and with the timing of a stand-up comic, Casey
            has spent more than 20 years dealing with thousands of
            penises and witnessing a host of anxiety disorders.
            &ldquo;Wanting to get the foreskin back is actually a
            body dysmorphic issue. It&rsquo;s an obsession with the
            genitalia. Get over it! It&rsquo;s mostly skin.
            It&rsquo;s like losing a tooth.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>It is easy to be seduced by Casey&rsquo;s argument,
            especially after watching a full-frontal demonstration
            of T-taping, the beleaguered penis stretched across the
            stomach, as if by Torquemada. But evidence shows that
            involuntary male circumcision can have physical, sexual
            and psychological consequences.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.cps.ca/"
            target="_blank">Canadian Paediatric Society</a> notes
            that approximately 25 infant boys of every thousand
            circumcised have surgical complications. Two or three
            suffer serious side effects. But these figures relate
            only to complications apparent immediately after
            surgery. There have been no detailed studies done on
            problems that don&rsquo;t manifest until later in life.
            If too much tissue is removed, erections become tight
            and uncomfortable; the shaft may even buckle within its
            own sheath. Hair-bearing skin, invisible in the infant,
            may be pulled up from the base and scrotum and cause
            irritation to both partners during intercourse. The raw
            wound, caused when the infant foreskin is forcibly
            separated from the glans, can scar and form a skin
            bridge between the head and shaft that pulls the penis
            to one side.</p>

            <p>Surgical reconstruction of the foreskin is still a
            relatively unrefined procedure. <a
            href="http://www.psurg.com/DR.htm" target="_blank">Dr.
            Robert Stubbs</a>, an internationally known cosmetic
            surgeon famed for his penile lengthening and fattening
            techniques, was alarmed by the flawed methodology of
            other surgeons who attempt the fashioning of a
            faux-foreskin by means of a skin graft or by everting a
            cylindrical flap of penile skin over the glans. And so
            Stubbs recently invented his own approach. To date he
            has performed only three procedures, turning away more
            than 90 per cent of applicants on physical or
            psychological grounds (a large scrotum and a healthy
            attitude are required). He advises newly divorced,
            melancholy males to buy a Porsche instead.</p>

            <p>A specialist in penile enhancement with the name
            Stubbs is well used to the taunting of colleagues.
            Sitting on the edge of his desk, surgical cap perched
            rakishly aslant his greying hair, he laughs at Dr.
            Casey&rsquo;s comments. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
            urolo&shy;gist! He&rsquo;s spouting the cop-out
            diagnosis of if it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix
            it. I&rsquo;m a plastic surgeon, and therefore I look
            at quality of life. If a woman has to have a breast
            removed and opts for reconstruction, there are still
            doctors who will say &lsquo;Why would she
            bother?&rsquo; I&rsquo;m fixing heads&mdash;no pun
            intended.&rdquo; He excuses himself to check on his
            next patient, a young man who&rsquo;d undergone the
            first stage of his operation a few days before and who
            might be available for an interview. Earlier, I had
            spotted him, lean and dark-eyed, as he shuffled into
            the subdued lighting of the waiting room like an
            arthritic octogenarian. Suddenly a piercing scream
            emanates from the exam room, followed by the plaintive
            sob, &ldquo;It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.&rdquo; When
            Stubbs returns, he smiles gently, saying, &ldquo;I
            don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s ready for an interview at
            the moment.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Paul Tinari is another of Stubbs&rsquo; patients. An
            extreme example of circumcision as physical assault,
            his was performed in 1965, when he was eight years old,
            because of supposed masturbatory tendencies. He was
            held down by two priests at a Catholic residential
            school in Montreal, his nose and wrist broken in the
            struggle as his foreskin was crudely severed.</p>

            <p>At the Coffee Mill, located in the same building as
            Stubbs&rsquo; Yorkville practice, Tinari is oblivious
            to the Rosedale matrons who abandon their strudel and
            listen slack-jawed to his explicit opinions, delivered
            in a voice that rises in tandem with his passion.
            &ldquo;The whole microbiology of the penis changes and
            therefore so do the bacteria that live there.
            Circumcision may be one of the reasons why the
            treatment of yeast infection in women is a
            multi-billion-dollar industry in North America. And
            there is a profit made in selling foreskins for
            biochemical analysis and in the manufacture of
            artificial skin.&rdquo; The lanky, red-haired engineer
            tends to lecture instead of converse, rapidly
            expounding on his &ldquo;endless process of
            becoming,&rdquo; as well as his skills as an
            epidemiologist, &ldquo;imagination engineer&rdquo; and
            futurist. But his emotional rant is factual.</p>

            <p>He was well into adulthood before he realized that
            erections are not supposed to hurt. Manual stretching
            of his skin was never an option because of the heavy
            scarring and skin loss, and so tomorrow, Stubbs will
            operate. Tinari, who now lives in Vancouver, was
            referred to the plastic surgeon by his B.C. urologist
            and psychiatrist, and the $12,000 operation is being
            funded by <a href="http://www.hibc.gov.bc.ca/"
            target="_blank">British Columbia&rsquo;s health
            plan</a>. He believes the government&rsquo;s generosity
            stems from a desire to avoid his launch of a lawsuit,
            &ldquo;plus, they realized it was pay for this or pay
            for my psychological treatments for the rest of my
            life.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>In simple terms, the operation involves slitting the
            skin of the scrotum horizontally in two places and
            threading the penis through. For three weeks, the organ
            lies comfortably in its temporary bed, snuggled like a
            pig in a blanket, and the scrotum skin grafts onto a
            designated area of the shaft. A second operation to
            separate the newly dressed penis leaves a movable
            &ldquo;foreskin.&rdquo; Tinari&rsquo;s second surgery
            is successful. &ldquo;Three days of pain and then lots
            of gentle walking exercise,&rdquo; he says.
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very pleased.&rdquo; The new foreskin
            behaves more or less like a real one. Since it is
            scrotal skin, it could eventually grow hair, but,
            Stubbs says matter-of-factly, that can be rectified
            with electrolysis.</p>

            <p>Foreskin restoration is not a new invention; even
            the ancient Greeks employed various methods of
            stretching. But the Internet has created an energetic
            community. The National Organization of Restoring Men
            (<a href="http://www.norm.org"
            target="_blank">NORM</a>), <a
            href="http://www.nocirc.org"
            target="_blank">NOCIRC</a>, <a
            href="http://www.noharmm.org"
            target="_blank">NOHARMM</a> and the Circumcision
            Information and Resource Pages, among other sites,
            offer information and support on the topic (one
            that&rsquo;s not often discussed over beer and nachos)
            in anonymity. Visitors can read medical and academic
            papers and learn the pros and cons of each restoration
            method. While no stretching technique can restore the
            foreskin&rsquo;s erogenous tissue and nerves, men often
            report that the glans, now moist beneath its protective
            covering, reaches a new level of sensitivity. &ldquo;It
            is like seeing in colour after a lifetime of black and
            white,&rdquo; says one man; another describes the
            sensation as analogous to drawing a finger lightly
            across the back of the hand, compared to drawing it
            lightly across the palm.</p>

            <p>Steve Richards, a passionate 30-year-old journalist
            who manages NORM&rsquo;s Toronto chapter <a
            href="http://norm-toronto.foreskinrestorationchat.info/"
             target="_blank">Web site</a>, spent his adolescence on
            a NATO base where kids constantly teased him about what
            they called his Canadian turtleneck. &ldquo;At swim
            class, they wanted to know what was wrong with it. So
            when I went to university I got circumcised. But two
            months later I regretted it. It looked nicer before,
            and now I had to change the way I masturbated; there
            was nothing to move. I&rsquo;d had no clue what the
            foreskin really was. The doctor just did it with little
            explanation of consequences.&rdquo; He began taping in
            August of 2004. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be done by the end of
            this year.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Alex, the Oakville financial consultant, learned of
            restoration when researching a university paper on
            human sexuality and was intrigued by the discovery that
            something lost could be found again. &ldquo;My parents
            are immigrants and knew nothing about circumcision, so
            when the Toronto doctor talked about it at my birth,
            they both presumed my dad had been
            circumcised&mdash;which speaks a lot to the notion of
            informed consent.&rdquo; In 1999, Alex&rsquo;s first
            attempts at the process proved futile. He used only
            tape, no strapping, and his cursory search of the
            Internet had given him little idea of what he was
            actually doing. He gave up. Then his wife, Holly,
            became pregnant with their son, and circumcision was
            once again a topic of conversation. Five years after
            his first experiment, Alex embarked on a more
            comprehensive search of exactly what could be done.</p>

            <p>Holly was surprised at his wishes. &ldquo;My
            reaction was, Gosh!&rdquo; says the auburn-haired math
            teacher who&rsquo;d never actually experienced a
            foreskin. &ldquo;I told him that I loved his penis just
            the way it was. But he would talk about this piece of
            his own body that he hadn&rsquo;t been allowed to
            experience, that was taken away without his consent. He
            felt that nature must have intended it for something. I
            think the best word for him was wistful.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.canadiancrc.com/"
            target="_blank">Canadian Children&rsquo;s Rights
            Council</a>, a non-profit advocacy organization, takes
            the position that &ldquo;all Canadian children, both
            male and female, should be protected by the criminal
            laws of Canada with regards to this aggravated
            assault.&rdquo; No other amputation of a child&rsquo;s
            healthy tissue is permitted on a parent&rsquo;s
            preference. Activists hope that routine circumcision
            may one day follow the death throes of
            blood&shy;letting and incantations, and that men will
            never have to resort to T-tape, skin grafts and gallon
            jugs of milk again.</p>
