      <h2>$80,000 settlement to circumcised boy</h2>

      <p>By SUE REINERT<br />
       The Patriot Ledger</p>

      <p><a href="http://company.monster.com/quincymed/">Quincy
      Medical Center</a> and an obstetrician have agreed to pay
      more than $80,000 to a boy who was circumcised and whose
      parents say the procedure was carried out against their
      wishes.</p>

      <p>The parents told the hospital in August 1997 that they did
      not want their son circumcised, according to a malpractice
      suit filed by the parents. Nevertheless, Dr. Sandra Chenkin
      performed the procedure the day after he was born, court
      papers said.</p>

      <p>Medical insurance experts said the case was unusual
      because it was based on lack of <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/consent/">consent</a> rather than
      negligence, the usual grounds for a malpractice claim.</p>

      <p>There were no <a
      href="/library/complications/">complications from the
      surgery</a>, in which a doctor removes a sheath of skin
      covering the tip of the penis.</p>

      <p>Quincy Medical Center spokeswoman Karen Schwartzman said
      the incident occurred because a hospital policy requiring
      written consent for circumcisions &ldquo;was not adhered
      to.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Parents were supposed to be asked to sign a consent form
      after childbirth for the circumcision procedure, &ldquo;along
      with a number of other forms that get filled out at the same
      time,&rdquo; Schwartzman said.</p>

      <p>In this case, &ldquo;regrettably the consent form was not
      filled out,&rdquo; she said.</p>

      <p>Schwartzman said she had no information about
      conversations between the parents and the medical center
      before the birth.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Medical errors happen, and all too
      frequently,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Quincy Medical Center is
      not immune, but it is a problem at all hospitals.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Schwartzman added patients should judge a hospital by its
      &ldquo;whole picture&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;one incident
      two and a half years ago.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>The hospital closed its maternity unit in November 1998
      because of financial reasons.</p>

      <p>Chenkin practices in Brockton. Her lawyer did not return
      telephone calls.</p>

      <p>Papers filed at <a
      href="http://www.state.ma.us/courts/courtsandjudges/courts/norfsupmain.html">
      Norfolk Superior Court</a> contain the names of the parents
      and child. The <i>Patriot Ledger</i> is not publishing the
      names to protect the family's privacy.</p>

      <p>The case was settled Aug. 30, a little more than one month
      after the parents sued. The parents and their lawyer agreed
      to keep the terms of the settlement secret, not disclosing
      where the case had been filed and who had been sued. The
      <i>Patriot Ledger</i> obtained the court papers
      independently. The lawyer for the parents and child said he
      could not comment because of the settlement agreement.</p>

      <p>Under terms of the settlement, the parents received
      $14,418 in August and their lawyer was paid $20,000. The
      child will collect four annual payments of $20,588 starting
      on his 18th birthday, for a total of $82,352, the agreement
      said.</p>

      <p>The payments to parents, child and attorney total
      $116,770. However, Chenkin's insurer, which paid the
      settlement, laid out only $60,000 in cash: the immediate
      payments to the parents and their lawyer, plus a $25,352
      annuity to cover the future payments, the court papers
      said.</p>

      <p>Until about 10 years ago, circumcision was considered a
      routine procedure for newborn boys and few parents or doctors
      questioned it.</p>

      <p>Muslims and Jews practice circumcision as part of their
      religions. The practice has gone beyond religious boundaries
      to become almost universal in the United States. The parents
      who sued Quincy Medical Center claimed circumcision was
      against their religious beliefs.</p>

      <p>In recent years, evidence has mounted that circumcision is
      unnecessary and can present risks, like any surgery.</p>

      <p>In <a href="/library/statements/aap1999/">March 1999</a>,
      the <a href="http://www.aap.org/">American Academy of
      Pediatrics</a> withdrew its longtime support for the
      procedure, saying the benefits were not sufficient enough to
      justify a recommendation.</p>

      <p>The new guidelines said parents should decide, and laid
      out the benefits and risks.</p>

      <p>Malpractice lawyers and insurers said they didn't know of
      <a href="/news/1996.09.06_AlabamaWrongful/">a case similar
      to the Quincy Medical Center suit</a>.</p>

      <p>The suit was unusual because it hinged on lack of consent,
      not negligence by the doctor or hospital, said Boston
      malpractice lawyer David White-Lief.</p>

      <p>Under malpractice theory, <a
      href="/library/legal/USA/llewellyn/">surgery without consent
      is considered the same as an assault on the patient</a>,
      White-Lief said.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Any surgical procedure requires informed
      consent,&rdquo; he said.</p>

      <p>At least five area hospitals &ndash; Brockton Hospital,
      South Shore Hospital in Weymouth, Caritas Good Samaritan
      Medical Center in Brockton, Jordan Hospital in Plymouth and
      Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston &ndash; require
      written consent before performing a circumcision, officials
      said.</p>

      <p>Dr. Robert Nelson, a pediatrician at <a
      href="http://www.chop.edu/consumer/index.jsp">Children's
      Hospital</a> in Philadelphia and head of the <a
      href="/library/ethics/AAP/">bioethics committee</a> of the
      American Academy of Pediatrics, said hospital policies may
      vary but some form of consent is necessary before performing
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>Even if hospitals don't use a form, doctors should get
      consent verbally and document it, Nelson said.</p>

      <p>A spokeswoman for the <a
      href="http://www.acog.org/">American College of Obstetricians
      and Gynecologists</a> said the organization's <a
      href="/library/statements/acog2001/">guidelines</a> call for
      doctors to obtain consent but don't specify that it be
      written.</p>
