            <p><b>Tip Of Penis Amputated During
            Circumcision</b><br />
             Doctor Admits Mistake; Defense Later Questions Design
            Of Clamp Used</p>

            <p><b>$725,000 Settlement</b></p>

            <p>In June 1997, a baby boy was born to the plaintiffs.
            According to all involved, the mother and minor
            plaintiff were healthy and in satisfactory condition
            following the birth. The morning after the birth, the
            minor plaintiff was taken from the mother to be
            circumcised. The father did not accompany the minor
            plaintiff. Approximately one hour later, the defendant
            doctor entered the plaintiff parents' room and notified
            them that a small section at the tip of the infant's
            glans penis had been inadvertently excised.</p>

            <p>The defendant doctor further informed them that a
            surgeon was on the way to perform microsurgery to
            reattach the amputated section. The defendant doctor
            reportedly concluded by stating: "I wish I could blame
            the clamp, but I can't. It was my fault."</p>

            <p>The operative note stemming from the reattachment
            stated that only a tiny section of glans penis had been
            amputated during the circumcision, that no damage had
            been done to the child's urethra, and that full
            recovery was expected.</p>

            <p>Over the next two years, the minor plaintiff had a
            remarkable healing result. Follow-up appointments with
            different doctors, one of whom was a noted specialist
            from <a href="http://web1.tch.harvard.edu/"
            target="_blank">Children's Hospital</a> in Boston,
            confirmed that the minor plaintiff would not likely
            suffer any permanent injury as a result of the
            circumcision mishap. There were, however, slight
            cosmetic deficits at the tip of the minor plaintiff's
            penis, which were termed "skin tags." These skin tags
            were removed by laser surgery and did not reappear.</p>

            <p>The plaintiff's expert agreed that there was only a
            slight cosmetic deficit and that the urethra remained
            intact. He also agreed that the child would not suffer
            any decreased sensation due to the original insult. He
            added that he could not say for certain that the
            plaintiff would grow to have full sensation at the tip
            of his penis.</p>

            <p>As discovery progressed, the defense began to
            question the suitability of the <a
            href="/library/procedure/mogen/">Mogen clamp</a> used
            in the process. Despite the defendant doctor's
            admission that the incident was his fault, the defense
            persisted with claims that the Mogen clamp had a design
            defect, which could allow for a portion of the glans
            penis to become trapped during the clamping process and
            inadvertently excised.</p>

            <p>The plaintiffs did extensive research into the
            different implements used for circumcision, and opined
            that the doctor failed to make certain that only
            foreskin remained exposed after the clamp had been
            applied. Ultimately, the case was settled with a
            structured settlement, which will yield the child in
            excess of $750,000.</p>
