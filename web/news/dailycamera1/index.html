      <h2>Medical community, parents, debate the necessity of
      circumcision</h2>
      <b>By Clay Evans</b><br />
      <i>Camera Staff Writer</i> 

      <p>In the 1960s, when pediatrician Francesco Beuf's sons were
      born, the routine circumcision of newborn male infants in the
      United States was so prevalent that parents often weren't
      even included in the discussion.</p>

      <p>"My boys were born 36 and 37 years ago, and back then, we
      weren't even asked if we wanted the procedure or not," says
      Beuf, of Boulder's Pediatric Center. "It was just done."</p>

      <p>Circumcision, the removal of the foreskin of the penis by
      various methods, remains common among Jews and Muslims
      worldwide for religious reasons. However, with the notable
      exceptions of the United States and Australia, the ancient
      procedure is not widely done elsewhere.</p>

      <p>But increasingly, routine neonatal circumcision is being
      questioned by parents and doctors in the United States.
      According to the National Center for Health Statistics, about
      62.8 percent of newborn males were circumcised in 1997, the
      last year for which complete data have been analyzed. That
      number varies significantly from region to region, and even
      from hospital to hospital, according to local custom. In the
      Western states, only 38 percent of boys born in 1997 were
      circumcised, compared to 81 percent in the Midwest.</p>

      <p>If anything, it seems likely that those numbers will
      decrease in the wake of a <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">1999 Policy Statement</a>
      from the American Academy of Pediatrics' Task Force on
      Circumcision. Although the academy has never recommended
      routine circumcision, the latest policy went further than
      ever in casting doubts on its medical benefits.</p>

      <p>"Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential
      medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; however these
      data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal
      circumcision," the policy states. "In the case of
      circumcision; in which there are potential benefits, yet the
      procedure is not essential to the child's current well-being,
      parents should determine what is in the best interests of the
      child."</p>

      <p>The potential medical benefits can be summed up
      succinctly: Circumcision reduces the incidence of urinary
      tract infections (UTIs) in infant males, reduces the risk of
      a rare penile cancer (though only when performed in infancy),
      and recent studies indicate that circumcised men appear to be
      at a lower risk of contracting HIV, the virus believed to
      cause AIDS.</p>

      <p>As far as genital hygiene&mdash;keeping the prepuce clean
      and bacteria free&mdash;the policy indicates that those
      issues can be easily mitigated with proper care.</p>

      <p>Because there are sensitive religious and cultural issues
      at stake in the circumcision debate, the policy makes clear
      that "it is legitimate for the parents to take into account
      cultural, religious and ethnic traditions, in addition to
      medical factors, when making this choice." The policy also
      recommends that circumcision should only be performed when
      the infant has received adequate local analgesia, which
      wasn't the case even 20 years ago. "There is considerable
      evidence that newborns who are circumcised without analgesia
      experience pain and physiologic stress."</p>

      <p>For the most part, pediatricians (who, along with
      religious practitioners, do most circumcisions locally; in
      some areas of the country, obstetricians do the procedure)
      seem willing to go along with the AAP recommendations and
      leave the decision up to parents, even those like Beuf, who
      generally oppose it.</p>

      <p>"I try to hand (parents) as much information as possible
      and say it's their choice," Beuf says. "But I don't like to
      change a machine that works as beautifully as a human baby
      does."</p>

      <p>Carolyn Terman, a spokeswoman for Boulder Community
      Hospital says that more than 50 percent of newborn boys born
      there are circumcised. Centennial Valley Pediatrics in
      Louisville reports that about 75 percent of their male
      patients undergo the procedure, and Beuf says about 60
      percent do at the Pediatric Center. While religious
      practitioners do not necessarily use analgesia, local
      pediatricians do. "We generally tell the parents that it
      boils down to a social decision," says Dr. Scott Zimbelman of
      Centennial Valley. "What do you want your son to look
      like?"</p>

      <p>Anti-circumcision organizations&mdash;and there are many
      highly opinionated activist groups&mdash;hailed the 1999 AAP
      report as a victory. They argue that circumcision is not only
      traumatic for baby boys in the moment, but may cause
      lingering stress, even into adult life. (Studies have
      indicated that babies who were circumcised respond with more
      stress to later procedures, such as inoculation, but none has
      confirmed this continues into adulthood.)</p>

      <p>Opponents also say there is an ethical issue at stake:
      Parents and doctors, they say, are removing healthy, normal
      tissue that later in life can heighten sexual pleasure and
      provide protection for the glans of the penis.</p>

      <p>"I'm for intact penises all the way," says Darcy Kamin, a
      Boulder registered nurse in private practice who had her own
      sons circumcised years ago, but changed her mind after
      assisting with circumcisions at <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.bch.org/">Boulder Community Hospital</a>. "I
      watched with horror as these kids were strapped down and had
      their genitals carved on. It was really clear to me that it
      was terrifying to them. It was brutal, not an OK way to treat
      a baby, or anybody."</p>

      <p>Beth Engel of Estes Park said she chose not to circumcise
      her two sons, 10-months-old and 4-years-old, simply because
      she considers the procedure to be primarily cosmetic. "I
      think it's an unnecessary procedure, and I felt that the
      hygiene reasoning was not accurate," she says. "Basically,
      I'm not into unnecessary intervention."</p>

      <p>Despite the most recent AAP policy&mdash;which essentially
      counsels informed consent, parental rights and the use of
      anesthesia&mdash;some doctors still argue the procedure's
      benefits outweigh the risks, which include the potential for
      bleeding and infection in newborns. Complications develop in
      about one of every 476 cases, according to one study
      published in Pediatrics magazine.</p>

      <p>Dr. Edgar J. Schoen, former chairman of the AAP's
      circumcision task force, has been especially vocal in support
      of circumcision. In March, he and two colleagues wrote a
      rebuttal to the policy, which ran in AAP's Pediatrics
      magazine. He accused the Task Force of "narrow, biased and
      inadequate data analysis."</p>

      <p>"By ignoring important medical evidence and discouraging
      newborn circumcision, the AAP Task Force is placing infant
      boys at increased risk for appreciable illness throughout
      life," they wrote. Circumcision advocates also say that
      beyond infection and hygiene issues, the procedure can
      eliminate phimosis&mdash;a condition in which the foreskin is
      too tight. "The medical benefits of circumcision are proven
      by peer-reviewed, evidence-based studies and are not just
      'potential' as claimed by the Task Force," Schoen and his
      colleagues wrote. In fact, the new AAP policy included
      substantial data about potential benefits of circumcision,
      but argued that they were small, statistically speaking:</p>

      <p><b>Uncircumcised</b> infants contract urinary tract
      infections at an estimated rate of 7 to 14 cases per 100,000
      babies, compared to one to two cases for circumcised baby
      boys, a sevenfold difference.</p>

      <p><b>An estimated</b> .9 to 1 percent of men will develop
      penile cancer in their lives&mdash;nine to 10 men in a
      million&mdash;and uncircumcised men have a threefold greater
      risk.</p>

      <p><b>Studies</b> about the relationship between circumcision
      and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, are
      "complex and conflicting," but "there is a substantial body
      of evidence that links non-circumcision in men with (greater)
      risk for HIV infection." However, the policy concludes,
      "behavioral factors appear to be far more important than
      circumcision status."</p>

      <p>Marilyn Milos, a California nurse who lost her job because
      of her opposition to routine circumcision and now heads
      NOCIRC&mdash;the National Organization of Circumcision
      Information Resource Centers&mdash;says those small risks are
      not enough reason to traumatize a baby.</p>

      <p>Milos says the American obsession with circumcision arose
      in the late 1800s, when the procedure was touted as a way to
      prevent masturbation in boys. When they realized that
      "nothing short of death was going to prevent masturbation,"
      she says, circumcision advocates next touted hygiene, and
      later, the issue of conformity&mdash;"looking the same in the
      locker room"&mdash;and most recently, the danger of AIDS.</p>

      <p>"This circumcision experiment has not worked for any of
      the reasons put forth," Milos says. And, says Kamin, removing
      healthy tissue is a heavy-handed way to prevent statistically
      rare problems.</p>

      <p>"We don't cut off girls' breasts at birth because they
      might get cancer," she says. "And girls get more urinary
      tract infections than boys&mdash;but that's easily covered by
      antibiotics."</p>

      <p>Complicating the debate is the fact that Jews and Muslims
      believe that circumcision is prescribed, based on the same
      passage in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, when God
      made his covenant with Abraham: "Every male among you shall
      be circumcised." (For Christians, the procedure is optional,
      according to the writings of Paul in the New Testament.)</p>

      <p>"We knew that it was a purely ritual act, and that's how
      we treated it," says Alex Wolf of Lafayette, a Jewish man
      whose 2-year-son was circumcised as an infant. "As a ritual,
      it was very powerful. To go through something that traumatic
      as parents and for him as a newborn, it clarified our bond in
      a certain way."</p>

      <p>Wolf says he and his wife felt that there wouldn't be any
      longterm emotional effects, noting that birth itself is
      traumatic, and that they wanted to raise their child
      according to Jewish tradition.</p>

      <p>"I just felt the tug of the covenant, and if I decided not
      to, it would be going against something so core in the
      Bible," he says. "But if we were Christians, no way would we
      have done it."</p>
