            <h2>Circumcision Opponents Use the Legal System and
            Legislatures</h2>
            <b>By ADAM LIPTAK</b> 

            <p><span class="init">F</span>ARGO, N.D., Jan. 16
            &mdash; Josiah Flatt, like about 60 percent of other
            newborn American boys, was circumcised soon after he
            was born here, in the spring of 1997. Two years later,
            his parents sued the doctor and the hospital.</p>

            <p>They did not contend that the circumcision was
            botched or deny that Josiah's mother, <a
            href="http://www.zbaer.com/anita.htm"
            target="_blank">Anita Flatt</a>, had consented to the
            procedure in writing. They said, instead, that the
            doctor had failed to tell them enough about the pain,
            complications and consequences of circumcision,
            removing the foreskin of the penis.</p>

            <p>The suit will be heard by a jury next month. In
            declining to dismiss the case here before trial, Judge
            <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/Rothe-Seeger.htm"
             target="_blank">Cynthia Rothe-Seeger</a> acknowledged
            that the case was unusual in that nothing "went `wrong'
            during the procedure." The main harm Josiah seeks
            compensation for, Judge Rothe-Seeger noted, is
            "diminished sexual sensation injury."</p>

            <p>The suit is but one effort by a small but energetic
            group of loosely affiliated advocates and lawyers to
            use the legal system to combat the practice &mdash;
            most American newborn boys undergo the operation when
            they are days old &mdash; which they liken to genital
            cutting in girls.</p>

            <p>The advocates have been active in state
            legislatures, too. Ten states no longer allow Medicaid
            to pay for circumcision.</p>

            <p>"They have reached the ears of legislators and
            insurance companies," Dr. Thomas Wiswell, a professor
            of pediatrics at the State University of New York at
            Stony Brook and a proponent of the procedure, said
            about the opponents. "They are far more vocal than
            proponents of circumcision."</p>

            <p>J. Steven Svoboda, director of <a
            href="http://www.arclaw.org/" target="_blank">Attorneys
            for the Rights of the Child</a>, a group devoted to the
            issue, contends that circumcision is wrong as a matter
            of law, medicine and philosophy. Children of both
            sexes, Mr. Svoboda said, should be entitled to "bodily
            integrity."</p>

            <p>Josiah Flatt's case appears to be the first to go to
            trial based on the theory that the absence of an
            exhaustive medical briefing about the risks and
            benefits of circumcision is tantamount to a lack of
            informed consent.</p>

            <p>Among the possible complications in the operation
            are excess bleeding, infection and ulceration and
            occasional permanent damage to the penis.</p>

            <p>"This could be a very important test case," said
            Geoffrey P. Miller, a professor of law at <a
            href="http://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York
            University</a> who has written about <a
            href="/library/legal/miller1/">legal and cultural
            issues</a> of circumcision.</p>

            <p>Josiah's father, James, died in 2001 in an
            automobile accident, but the boy's mother, Anita, 33,
            decided to proceed with the suit. The family's lawyer,
            <a href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a>, said no sensible parent
            would willingly subject a child to circumcision knowing
            what it entailed.</p>

            <p>"The practice is absolutely barbaric," Mr. Baer
            said.</p>

            <p>The doctor who performed the circumcision, <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734"
             target="_blank">Sunita Kantak</a>, and representatives
            of the hospital, the <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Medical Center</a>, issued
            this statement:</p>

            <p>"Anita Flatt was given information about
            circumcision, and she asked to have her son
            circumcised. The circumcision was done because she
            requested it."</p>

            <p>A hospital spokeswoman, Carrie Johnson, declined to
            elaborate.</p>

            <p>In court papers, the hospital said the suit was part
            of a crusade.</p>

            <p>"This lawsuit is an attempt to abolish circumcision
            in North Dakota of newborn males with healthy
            foreskin," the hospital's lawyers wrote. "Plaintiffs
            want to change public policy so that only a competent
            male once he reaches adulthood, and not his parent,
            should be able to consent to circumcision."</p>

            <p>Only 3 in 1,000 men not circumcised at birth choose
            to have the procedure, experts say.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://firms.findlaw.com//llewellynlaw/practices.htm"
             target="_blank">David J. Llewellyn</a>, a Georgia
            lawyer who represents plaintiffs in circumcision
            malpractice cases, said the hospital was correct in
            identifying what would be the next step for opponents
            of the practice.</p>

            <p>"The question of whether or not a parent can consent
            at all will come rather quickly," Mr. Llewellyn
            said.</p>

            <p>Judge Rothe-Seeger, who will preside over the trial
            in <a href="http://www.co.cass.nd.us/"
            target="_blank">Cass County</a> <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/COURT/DISTRICTS/EC.HTM"
             target="_blank">District Court</a>, seemed to agree in
            a pretrial decision. She suggested that Josiah could
            sue his parents some day if he could show that they
            failed to act in his best interests.</p>

            <p>About 1.2 million newborns are circumcised in the
            United States every year, at a cost of $150 million to
            $270 million, the <a href="http://www.aap.org/"
            target="_blank">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>
            says.</p>

            <p>Circumcision for other than religious reasons is a
            relatively recent phenomenon in the United States. It
            began in the late 19th century and peaked in the 1960's
            at 90 percent of newborns. Circumcision rates vary
            widely. They are highest in the Midwest, about 80
            percent, and lowest in the West, under 40 percent.</p>

            <p>The procedure is not common elsewhere. In <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statistics/Canada/">Canada</a>,
            the rate is 17 percent and in <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statistics/UK/">Britain</a>
            5 percent. Elsewhere in Europe, in South America and in
            non-Muslim Asia, the procedure is rare.</p>

            <p>There is powerful evidence, Dr. Wiswell said, that
            circumcision helps prevent <a
            href="/library/disease/UTI/mueller/">urinary tract
            infections</a>, <a
            href="/library/disease/cancer/vanhowe/">penile
            cancer</a> and <a
            href="/library/disease/STD/vanhowe6/">sexually
            transmitted diseases</a>, including <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/vanhowe4/">
            H.I.V.</a></p>

            <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics, in a <a
            href="/library/statements/aap1999/">policy
            statement</a> in 1999, said that the risks of infection
            and cancer were low even without the procedure and that
            evidence on sexually transmitted diseases was "complex
            and conflicting."</p>

            <p>The academy noted that the procedure could involve
            complications, as could any surgery. If performed
            without adequate anesthesia, it is very painful.</p>

            <p>The academy concluded that "existing scientific
            evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of
            newborn male circumcision."</p>

            <p>"However," it added, "these data are not sufficient
            to recommend routine neonatal circumcision."</p>

            <p>It added that it was "legitimate for parents to take
            into account cultural, religious and ethnic traditions,
            in addition to the medical factors, when making this
            decision."</p>

            <p>Judge Rothe-Seeger wrote, "One of the earliest
            purposes of circumcision was to limit sexual
            intercourse and to curb sexual excitement."</p>

            <p>It has also been prescribed through the years as a
            remedy for alcoholism, epilepsy, asthma, gout,
            hysteria, malnutrition, night terrors, clubfoot, eczema
            and promiscuity.</p>

            <p>"Circumcision is a medical procedure in search of
            something to cure," said Mr. Baer, the Flatts'
            lawyer.</p>

            <p>In the last year, <a
            href="/news/thetribune06-14-02/">Arizona</a>, <a
            href="/news/columbiamissourian07-25-02/">Missouri</a>,
            <a href="/news/themissoulian12-21-02/">Montana</a> and
            <a href="/news/charlotteobserver09-21-02/">North
            Carolina</a> joined six other states &mdash;
            California, Mississippi, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon
            and Washington &mdash; that do not offer Medicaid
            reimbursement for circumcision for any reason,
            including religious beliefs.</p>

            <p>David L. Gollaher, who wrote "Circumcision: A
            History of the World's Most Controversial Surgery"
            (Basic Books, 2000), said that trend would "be the
            bullet that kills this thing."</p>

            <p>"If people have to pony up a couple of hundred
            bucks, at the margin, they won't do it," Mr. Gollaher
            said. "And insurance coverage signals a certain
            attitude about medical appropriateness or
            necessity."</p>

            <p>There is little <a
            href="/library/legal/conundrum/">legal scholarship</a>
            in the area. That is partly attributable, Professor
            Miller said, to efforts intended to prevent genital
            cutting in girls, a practice prevalent in Africa that
            reduces sexual pleasure.</p>

            <p>"It's all tied up in the politics of feminism," he
            said. "Some feminists take offense at the idea that
            there is any comparison between a highly damaging
            assault committed by a patriarchal society and male
            circumcision. It's a dangerous topic to get into."</p>

            <p>In an interview, Ms. Flatt, who is a lawyer, said
            she was told next to nothing about circumcision before
            she consented to it. Asked what she wished she had been
            told, she grew animated and her voice rose.</p>

            <p>"It's <a
            href="/library/disease/STD/fleiss3/">healthy
            tissue</a>," she said of the foreskin. "It's useful.
            There's <a
            href="/news/theprovince08-29-02/">bleeding</a> risk.
            There's <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/howard/">pain</a>.
            There's <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications#infection">
            infection</a> risk. There's <a
            href="/library/death/">death</a> risk. There's no
            medical benefit.</p>

            <p>"You'd better give me a very good reason why, and
            it's got to be more than he'll look like dad."</p>
