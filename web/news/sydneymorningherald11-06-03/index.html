            better sex</h2>

            <p>November 6, 2003</p>

            <p><b>There is no scientific evidence in the case being
            put for circumcision, writes Stan Wisniewski.</b></p>

            <p>A <a href="http://www.fsa.au.com/index.php"
            target="_blank">Fertility Society of Australia</a>
            conference was told on Monday that recent studies
            showed circumcision protected men against HIV and
            lowered the risk of cervical cancer in their
            partners.</p>

            <p>However, there is no scientific evidence that
            circumcision prevents the distribution of sexually
            transmitted diseases in modern Western societies.</p>

            <p>To believe that undertaking circumcision will
            prevent HIV infection is irresponsible. Boys and their
            parents need to be taught appropriate hygiene methods
            of managing the foreskin in childhood and maintain
            appropriate hygiene measures throughout their
            lives.</p>

            <p>It is alarming that statistics taken from regions
            where men practise unprotected sex, and may have
            dubious hygiene information, are being used to support
            the practice of neonatal circumcision.</p>

            <p>The studies on papilloma virus in circumcised men
            have been conducted in communities where men are
            usually in monogamous relationships.</p>

            <p>It is not circumcision but the number of partners
            and the practice of unprotected sex that leads to
            papilloma virus being established and passed on.</p>

            <p>I wonder if proponents of circumcision would believe
            that circumcising the male population of Africa would
            prophylactically stop the spread of AIDS in that
            continent without there being a change to public and
            sexual health strategies?</p>

            <p>The motives for circumcision in our culture are
            difficult to define, but include rites of passage,
            blood sacrifices and cultural markings. Foreskin,
            however, is a normal part of the external genitalia and
            has a special function in protection of the glans penis
            in childhood and enhancing sexual activity in adult
            life.</p>

            <p><a href="/library/general/warren2/">Studies</a> have
            shown that the skin of the circumcised penis has a
            greater friction and abrasion within the vagina, and
            may lead to changes in sexual function and pleasure, in
            the male and his partner.</p>

            <p><a href="/library/anatomy/ohara/">Studies</a> have
            shown that women prefer vaginal intercourse with an
            anatomically complete penis.</p>

            <p>Such studies show circumcision may diminish the
            female's sexual enjoyment and affect her relationship
            with the male partner.</p>

            <p>In all discussions on circumcision in the newborn
            child one needs to understand that "informed consent"
            needs to be considered, and the impact of such consent
            may not only affect the male but his future sexual
            partner as well.</p>

            <p>In modern Western societies the rate of elective
            circumcision in newborn males is dropping, and
            continues to do so.</p>

            <p>The rate of circumcision in adult males continues to
            fall where appropriate hygiene measures are
            maintained.</p>

            <p>There is no scientific evidence that the
            prophylactic removal of the foreskin sustains any
            benefit and there is no solid epidemiological evidence
            to support the theory that circumcision prevents STDs
            or justifies a policy of involuntary mass circumcision
            as a public health measure.</p>
