            <h2>The unkindest cut? Many parents disenchanted with
            circumcision</h2>
            By Melissa Schorr,<br />
             STAFF WRITER 

            <h4>TO cut or not to cut, that is the question.</h4>

            <p>For generations, the choice to circumcise a baby boy
            has been second nature for American parents, for
            reasons ranging from health to hygiene to religious
            beliefs.</p>

            <p>But increasingly, Bay Area parents are questioning
            whether circumcision -- a surgical procedure that
            removes the foreskin covering the tip of the penis --
            truly is what nature intended. Even some Jewish
            families, who once wouldn't have thought twice about
            the religious tradition, are having second thoughts,
            seeing the procedure as cosmetic at best, inhumane at
            worst.</p>

            <p>When Rachel Berger, an Oakland-based journalist,
            gave birth to her son, Isaiah, 11 months ago, she was
            adamant against circumcising him, despite her own
            Jewish heritage.</p>

            <p>"I thought, 'Why mutilate my child?'" she recalls.
            "I didn't believe it was a medical necessity. I thought
            it was a pretty barbaric practice."</p>

            <p>Fueling the fire are a cluster of anti-circumcision
            activists based in the Bay Area, who heatedly claim
            that circumcision is tantamount to genital mutilation
            conducted without the child's medical consent.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">The foreskin is normal tissue,"
            declares Marilyn Milos, director of the <a
            href="http://www.nocirc.org/" target="_blank">National
            Organization of Circumcision Information Resource
            Centers</a>, an anti-circumcision group based in San
            Anselmo. "Circumcision is amputation of a normal body
            part that hurts, leaves psychological scars and denies
            a baby (its) right to its own determinism. It's a human
            rights issue."</span></p>

            <p>This concept of denial of personal choice especially
            resonates with Berger. "If my son decides at some point
            he wants to be circumcised, he can do it," she points
            out. "But it can't be undone."</p>

            <p>References against circumcision are popping up on TV
            sitcoms such as "Arrested Development," which has a
            character running a group called H.O.O.P., or Hands Off
            Our Penises. The debate has also entered the political
            arena, with 13 states, including California, no longer
            covering the procedure for infants covered by
            Medicaid.</p>

            <p>For Dr. Joel Piser, a Berkeley urologist and a mohel
            -- someone trained to perform the bris, or ritual
            circumcision for Jewish newborns -- the backlash is
            understandable.</p>

            <p>"I think we live in a time where people question
            everything," he says. "It's a reflection of that more
            than anything."</p>

            <p>Still, that small scrap of skin undeniably carries a
            lot of weight. "The foreskin is sacred in Berkeley,"
            Piser observes. "It is quite an emotional issue for a
            lot of people."</p>

            <p>For those of Jewish faith, the ritual of
            circumcision must be performed on the eighth day of
            life, as prescribed in the Torah, or Bible, in the book
            of Genesis. A joyous ceremony, the bris is a covenant
            made between God and the Israeli people. Although
            circumcision is not specifically discussed in the
            Koran, sayings of the prophet Mohammed encourage the
            practice, and Muslim baby boys are usually circumcised
            and named when they are seven days old.</p>

            <p>Adam Edell, a San Rafael software engineer, deeply
            regrets his own circumcision and that of his only son,
            who was born in Israel seven years ago.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Had I to do it over again, I
            definitely would not," he says. "I feel robbed of
            millions of nerve endings, of sensations I'm not going
            to feel and my son's not going to feel."</span></p>

            <p>Edell once passionately believed in circumcision as
            a part of his Jewish faith. But after leaving Israel
            and his religious beliefs behind, Edell now bemoans his
            choice.</p>

            <p>"It's ridiculous. It has no medical purpose," he
            says. "It's quite amazing that something so unfounded
            is something everyone does -- and in a very sensitive
            place, too."</p>

            <p>Health benefits examined</p>

            <p>Some health experts, however, strongly disagree
            there is no medical benefit.</p>

            <p>"From a medical side, do you need to be circumcised?
            The answer is no," Piser says. "But are there medical
            benefits from circumcision? The overwhelming answer is
            yes."</p>

            <p>Some of those include a dramatically lower chance of
            developing penile cancer or contracting urinary tract
            infections and sexually transmitted diseases such as
            AIDS, herpes and syphilis. In addition, circumcised men
            are less likely to pass along the human papillomavirus,
            or HPV, and its subsequent risk of cervical cancer to
            their partners.</p>

            <p>"I think it's the most important thing you can do to
            prevent your son from getting AIDS," Piser says.</p>

            <p>But weakening that case is the decidedly neutral <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/">policy</a>
            put out by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in
            1999. Although it did concede religious traditions are
            at play for groups such as Muslims and Jews, the
            academy concluded that it cannot recommend a policy of
            routinely circumcising newborns, after weighing the
            proven health benefits against the known risks.</p>

            <p>"The pediatricians are wimps," Piser says. "They
            didn't want to be in a position to tell all parents,
            'You have to do this.'"</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Essentially, the academy deemed
            the various health benefits to be only "potential,"
            while the established risks, such as infections or
            bleeding occurring in one in 500 procedures, are
            "known."</span></p>

            <p>"They put a negative spin on all the preventive
            health benefits," says Dr. Edgar Schoen, the former
            senior consultant of pediatrics at Kaiser Permanente
            Oakland Medical Center, who chaired an earlier AAP
            committee that came to a more positive conclusion.
            "With that group, nothing would have been
            sufficient."</p>

            <p>Schoen, although retired, is among the remaining
            avid defenders of circumcision, laying out his case at
            his Web site, www.medicirc.org. But more and more, the
            medical community, including Schoen's protege, Dr.
            Roberta Cunningham, a pediatrician who now heads the
            well baby program at Kaiser Oakland, is taking a
            neutral stance.</p>

            <p>"The (AAP) guidelines said there was no medical
            indication for performing circumcisions," she says.
            "Even though a lot of us felt that way already, at
            least we had that backing when advising parents."</p>

            <p>Cunningham had her own three sons circumcised years
            ago, knowing it was safe and not a traumatic
            experience, but would make a different decision today.
            <span class="yellow">"If I was having my kids now," she
            says flatly, "I wouldn't."</span></p>

            <p>For parents mainly concerned about subjecting their
            newborns to pain, however, Cunningham assures them
            there is little to fear. "There's very little physical
            trauma," says Cunningham, who has seen many children
            sleep right through the procedure. "I don't believe
            there's any psychological trauma."</p>

            <p>Today, pain relief is typically provided either with
            topical creams or new methods, such as the subcutaneous
            ring block, an injection under the skin.</p>

            <p>Health benefits aside, some parents still choose
            circumcision for aesthetic reasons or for no other
            reason than the gut instinct that boys should look like
            their father.</p>

            <p>The issue of hygiene</p>

            <p>Then there is the much-debated idea that
            circumcision is more "hygienic."</p>

            <p>"The thing that really started it in this country
            around the turn of the century was the big obsession
            people had with hygiene," says Schoen. "Circumcision
            started from the standpoint of improved
            cleanliness."</p>

            <p>But anti-circumcision activists claim those who are
            "intact" have no greater challenges staying clean,
            provided they are diligent about washing beneath the
            foreskin.</p>

            <p>Instead, they charge that the true motivation of
            circumcision was a Puritan urge to decrease sexual
            desire and masturbation among men.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Circumcision diminishes <a
            href="/library/sex_function/">sexual function</a>,"
            Milos states flatly. She adds that diminished feeling
            in men can translate into a less pleasurable experience
            for women as well.</span></p>

            <p>Some circumcised men who agree with Milos are taking
            action.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.norm.org/"
            target="_blank">National Organization of Restoring
            Men</a> runs monthly support sessions inside a Berkeley
            church for men who aim to restore themselves to their
            previous state by stretching their foreskins back into
            shape.</p>

            <p>At the meetings, the group's founder, R. Wayne
            Griffiths, 70, a Concord-based construction inspector,
            reviews a variety of devices from tape to more
            elaborate weights that use "moderate tension" to
            stimulate the creation of muscle tissue, as in weight
            lifting.</p>

            <p>"I've always been jealous or whatever about not
            being covered, and uncomfortable in whatever briefs I
            wear from the rubbing, so I decided I would restore,"
            explains Griffiths, who circumcised his own sons before
            his change of heart but has convinced them not to
            circumcise his grandsons.</p>

            <p>To date, his group's Web site has elicited more than
            a thousand responses to an online survey. "Men are
            becoming more aware of what has been done to them --
            mutilation that has denied them their physical
            pleasures -- and they're getting angry," he says.</p>

            <p>But for Schoen, the retired Kaiser pediatrician,
            this is just a sign of desperation.</p>

            <p>"Every year, as the (medical) evidence is coming in,
            the anti-circumcision people are getting angrier and
            more active," says Schoen. "Now, a lot have given up
            (disputing) the health benefits. They talk about that
            it ruins sex.</p>

            <p>"These are men who have problems with sexual
            function and blame it on circumcision. But we have 100
            million circumcised men in the United States, (so) a
            lot of them are going to have (unrelated) sexual
            problems."</p>

            <p>It's essentially an unresolvable debate, Cunningham
            says, because you can never truly compare what a man's
            sex life would have been like had he not been
            circumcised.</p>

            <p>On the decline</p>

            <p>Regardless, in California, the percentage of male
            newborns being circumcised is dropping dramatically, in
            contrast to national trends. Nationwide, there has been
            a small uptick in the percentage of newborns
            circumcised between 1979 and 1999, with two-thirds of
            all male babies circumcised in the hospital, and an
            additional five to 10 percent at home afterwards.</p>

            <p>But in California during that time, the rate of
            hospital circumcisions dropped from 64 percent to 37
            percent, according to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov"
            target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and
            Prevention</a>. Both sides in the debate agree this is
            primarily because of the high population of Asian and
            Hispanic residents, who don't have a strong cultural
            tradition of circumcision.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">But Milos claims her crusade
            has also changed minds. "I think it has to do with our
            educational efforts," she says. "People on the coasts
            don't cling to tradition. We're more progressive and
            open to new ideas."</span></p>

            <p>Schoen believes the Bay Area's "genital chic"
            movement and the pediatricians' naysaying ultimately
            will be dismissed by most Americans.</p>

            <p>"The U.S. public seems to be smarter than the
            professionals," he says. "My prediction is, as the
            evidence gets out, it'll be more popular."</p>
