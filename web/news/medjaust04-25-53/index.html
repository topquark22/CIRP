            <hr width="60" align="center" size="1" color="black" />

            <p class="text">A <span class="sc">MEETING</span> of
            the Melbourne P&aelig;diatric Society was held at the
            Children's Hospital, Melbourne, on Wednesday, November
            12, 1952.</p>

            <h5>Why Circumcise?</h5>

            <p class="text">D<span class="sc">R</span>. J<span
            class="sc">OHN</span> D. B<span class="sc">EGG</span>
            read a paper entitled "Why Circumcise?". He said that
            the operation had been performed in many countries
            since time immemorial, but it was extraordinary how
            little was known of the origin and purpose of the
            ancient custom. It was performed in Egypt at least 4000
            years. B.C., probably even earlier still, and was
            practised as a cult among the primitive peoples of such
            widely separated countries as Africa and the North
            American continent and among Australian aborigines. It
            had been a Jewish custom to circumcise on the eighth
            day after birth since early Biblical times, and
            although the Koran did not specifically ordain it, all
            Moslems were circumcised. It was a mystery why mankind,
            down the ages, should have shown such a strong aversion
            to the retention of a useful cutaneous appendage; for,
            despite the enormous literature on the subject, very
            fully dealt with in Hasting's "Encyclop&aelig;dia of
            Religion and Ethics", there was little real knowledge
            of the significance of the ancient rite.</p>

            <p class="text">It was tempting to ascribe a hygienic
            motive to the procedure, but a critical view analysis
            of the literature does not support such a view. Even if
            the view was found to be empirically correct, it could
            scarcely have been the original motive that prompted
            the Egyptians to circumcise their young. Gray, in the
            Encyclop&aelig;dia of Religion and Ethics", concluded
            his summary by finding that in its inception, and late
            into its development, circumcision was essentially a
            religious custom, embracing in its broadest sense
            several concepts of an ideological nature. Thus, it
            might signify a sanctification of the reproductive
            organs, ensuring abundant fertility; it might be
            related to the ancient idea of human
            sacrifice-sacrifice of a small portion of the body as a
            propitiation of the Deity to protect the whole; or it
            might serve as initiation of the youth into the full
            manhood of the tribe.</p>

            <p class="text">With primitive peoples the operation
            was usually carried out to the accompaniment of various
            ceremonials, often of a cruel and revolting nature; but
            in contradistinction to these, one Australian tribe
            performed a mock ceremony before the candidate,
            flourishing a large wooden knife, but leaving him
            untouched. That it had a deeply religious significance
            to the Jews was, of course, a matter of common
            knowledge, but whilst one maintained ancient usages, it
            was reasonable to examine critically a procedure which
            although performed as a religious rite by one section
            of the community, was also carried out very frequently
            for supposedly surgical reasons by another.</p>

            <p class="text">Circumcision was performed on some 75%
            of male children born in Melbourne's private maternity
            homes, and although it was not performed routinely at
            the Women's or the Queen Victoria Hospital, many of the
            babies born in those institutions were later subjected
            to the operation at the Children's Hospital, or else at
            the p&aelig; departments of the Alfred, Queen Victoria,
            Prince Henry's and Saint Vincent's Hospitals, as well
            as at the hands of private medical practitioners.</p>

            <p class="text">Figures revealed that in the hospitals
            mentioned nearly a thousand babies were circumcised
            annually; but as about six thousand boys were born
            annually in Melbourne's two major public maternity
            hospitals, even if allowance was made for circumcisions
            performed by private practitioners, the incidence of
            the operation was very much lower than in those of the
            higher income groups who attended the private
            institutions where three-quarters of the male babies
            were circumcised. <a
            href="/library/general/gairdner/">Gairdner</a>, in the
            <i>British Medical Journal</i> of December 24, 1949, in
            making a comparison between children attending the best
            known public schools and those attending state
            institutions, had stated that "either the boys of
            well-to-do parents are suffering circumcision much too
            often or those of the poorer parents not often
            enough".</p>

            <p class="text">Dr. Begg then discussed the development
            and function of the prepuce, as described by Gairdner.
            He said it developed as a ring of thickened epidermis
            growing forward over the glans, and during its
            development, which was frequently incomplete at birth,
            the squamous epithelium lining the inner surface of the
            prepuce and the outer surface of the glans was fused
            into one single sheet. According to <a
            href="/library/anatomy/deibert/">Deibert</a>, a
            separation into two separate linings took place by the
            epithelium arranging itself into whorls, in the centres
            of which degeneration occurred. The fusion of these
            degenerate areas ultimately formed a continuous
            sub-preputial space. The process, which was seldom
            complete at birth, might be arrested at any stage of
            its development. Thus, again, according to Gairdner,
            only 4% of babies had a fully retractable foreskin at
            birth, only 25% at six months, and 50% at the end of
            the first year. At the end of the second year. At the
            end of the third year, however, 90% of children would
            have a retractable foreskin; so that it was obviously
            fallacious to regard non-retractability of the foreskin
            at birth as synonymous with phimosis. Even those which
            could not readily be retracted at the age of three
            years could usually be rendered easily retractable by
            the separation with a probe of the residual strands of
            undegenerated epithelium still persisting between the
            inner preputial layer and the outer layer of the glans.
            Dr. Begg said that he had no accurate figures with
            which to confirm the statistics, but eleven years of
            observation in a provincial town where very few babies
            were circumcised had convinced him that true phimosis
            must be a very rare condition.</p>

            <p class="cirp">[CIRP Note: The values regarding age of
            foreskin retractability provided by Gairdner in 1949
            recently have been shown to be incorrect. See the
            recent <a
            href="http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/178_11_020603/matters_arising_020603-1.html"
             target="_blank">letter</a> at the <i>Medical Journal
            of Australia</i> for more information.]</p>

            <p class="text">The function of the prepuce seemed
            obviously to clothe and protect the sensitive glans,
            not only during the early years of incontinence when
            the organ was in contact with urine-soaked clothes, but
            throughout life as well.</p>

            <p class="text">Like other surgical operations,
            circumcision carried an operative risk. The risk was
            admittedly small, but h&aelig;morrhage, sepsis, and
            an&aelig;sthetic accidents could occur, whilst, as the
            operation was frequently performed by practitioners of
            little surgical skill, mutilation of the organ was
            unfortunately by no means rare. The figures for
            Australia were not readily available, but for the
            five-year period from 1942 to 1947, an average of
            sixteen children died annually as a direct result of
            the operation in England and Wales. There was every
            reason to believe that a proportionate mortality would
            prevail in Australia.</p>

            <p class="text">Contact of the delicate tip of the
            glans with ammonia-soaked clothes not infrequently led
            to ulceration of the urethral meatus, and that, apart
            from being exceedingly painful, was at times difficult
            to heal and could even lead to a meatal stricture. That
            complication of circumcision was particularly likely to
            occur in a child whose prepuce had become redundant
            from ammonia irritation-an appearance which
            unfortunately was regarded by some doctors as a
            particular indication for circumcision. Removal of the
            foreskin in such circumstances had been likened by a
            contributor to the <i>British Medical Journal</i> some
            years previously to "a soldier taking off his tin hat
            when the shrapnel was falling"; the irritation was
            transferred to the meatus with the inevitable
            result.</p>

            <p class="text">Dr. Begg then proceeded to examine the
            reasons given by parents for requesting that their
            child be subjected to the operation, and mentioned that
            inquiries from the nursing staffs of maternity
            hospitals revealed that the majority of babies were
            circumcised at the request of their parents and not at
            the advice of their doctors. Dr. Begg said that in his
            experience in questioning mothers of newborn babies on
            the reason for requesting circumcision, by far the most
            common reason given-and this was confirmed by nursing
            staffs-was that the father wanted it done. The
            information was imparted by the mother with a slightly
            mysterious air as if questioning that anyone should
            doubt the paternal wisdom. On being further questioned,
            most would volunteer that they thought it prevented the
            child from wetting the bed or that it prevented in some
            mysterious way the development of venereal disease or
            the habit of masturbation. No doctor these days would
            seriously regard circumcision as a cure of enuresis,
            whilst, if the psychiatrists were to be believed,
            masturbation occurred in both sexes, and appeared to
            have no relation to the presence or absence of the
            prepuce. Venerologists agreed that the circumcised man
            who contracted syphilis or gonorrh&oelig;a was easier
            to manage, but there was no real evidence that the
            operation in any way lessened the incidence of those
            diseases. The matter was of still less importance at
            the present time, with chemotherapy and the greatly
            lessened incidence of venereal disease in general.
            Cleanliness was another reason given by parents, and it
            was in regard to that that a considerable misconception
            existed amongst both medical and non-medical people. It
            was true that smegma, the main source of which was
            generated epithelium lining the glans and prepuce,
            together with a variable amount from minute secretory
            glands near the fr&aelig;num, did collect in the
            retrocoronal sulcus, but in the young child it was
            non-odorous and entirely harmless. Later, as mild
            decomposition of the smegma might occur, and as
            infection might then be added, it was wise to take
            steps to remove it. At the stage when that was likely
            to happen, however, separation of the two layers had
            taken place, and the foreskin, if not readily
            retractable, could easily be made so. Miscellaneous
            reasons, such as "we believe in it" and the frankly
            feminine one, "it looks nicer," were occasionally
            given.</p>

            <p class="text">Circumcision, therefore, though
            sometimes advised by the obstetrician, was more often
            performed by him to satisfy the parental wish. If
            non-retractability of the foreskin at birth was
            regarded with equanimity, it would be found that in
            time the vast majority of foreskins were so easily
            retracted as to fall within the scope of all but the
            most incapable.</p>

            <p class="text">It appeared to be an indisputable fact
            that carcinoma of the penis was virtually unknown in
            those circumcised before the age of five. It did,
            however, occur occasionally in Moslems who were
            circumcised between the sixth and the fourteenth years,
            but less commonly than in the uncircumcised. Thus
            Kennaway, in the <i>British Journal of Cancer</i>,
            comparing the incidence of the disease in Moslems with
            that of Hindus, among whom the operation was taboo, in
            fourteen hospitals in India, showed that the ratio of
            penile cancer to male cancer in Hindus was a high as
            1:3.9, while that in Moslems was only 1:34.3. He
            suggested that failure of the operation until the
            fourteenth year to confer the immunity produced by that
            performed in infancy, was due to carcinogens retained
            in the coronal sulcus, and if carcinoma of the penis
            was a common disease, there could be a very potent
            argument in favour of universal circumcision at an
            early age. The disease, however, was not a common one,
            particularly in western countries. An average of 6.3
            cases annually were met with in Melbourne's public
            hospitals over a five-year period, representing only
            0.3% of male carcinomata in general. Furthermore, it
            usually occurred in persons with a low standard of
            personal hygiene, and was almost always associated with
            true organic phimosis. Accordingly, a disease whose
            main incidence was after the sixth decade of life, and
            which was probably as easily prevented by simple
            attention to cleanliness as by circumcision, could not
            be cited as a convincing argument for subjecting every
            baby boy to the operation.</p>

            <p class="text">In conclusion, <span class="yellow">Dr.
            Begg summarized his paper by saying that circumcision,
            commencing as an expression of primitive man's
            religious emotions, was carried on largely as a
            response to a widespread public demand. That demand was
            based on a misconception of the benefits conferred by
            the operation, which in the great majority of children
            is unnecessary. As unnecessary surgery was bad surgery,
            the time has come when the profession should deprecate
            its widespread performance in infancy except for
            religious reasons.</span> Indications for the operation
            existed only if, after the first few years, true
            phimosis was found to be present.</p>

            <p class="text">In short, the answer to the question
            which formed the title of the paper, "Why Circumcise?",
            must be found in many cases "Why indeed?".</p>

            <p class="text">D<span class="sc">R</span>. F. S<span
            class="sc">TONEHAM</span> said he agreed with Dr. Begg.
            Phimosis could be corrected by dilatation of the
            foreskin with sinus forceps in most cases and
            circumcision was not necessary.</p>

            <p class="text">D<span class="sc">R</span>. J. F<span
            class="sc">ARBER</span> said that at birth the prepuce
            could be retracted in certain infants but not in
            others. He had been surprised at the number of infants
            whose prepuce was not retractable at birth, but was
            easily retractable two to three months later.</p>

            <p class="text">D<span class="sc">R</span>. M. L.
            P<span class="sc">OWELL</span> referred to the
            advisability of circumcision in some cases in the
            tropics as a means to reducing dermatitis of the
            prepuce and <i>glans penis</i>. He wondered if that
            fact had any significance with regard to religious
            rites amongst Moslems.</p>

            <p class="text">Dr. Begg replied that during the last
            war circumcised serviceman had certainly suffered less
            dermatitis of the penis, and he agreed with Dr. Powell
            that might have been the basis of circumcision in some
            religions.</p>
