            <h2>Parents reconsider routine circumcision</h2>
            BY CHRISTINE FACCIOLO | GANNETT NEWS SERVICE 

            <p>When Sarah Altemus was expecting her first child,
            she had an important decision to make: Whether the baby
            should be circumcised if it was a boy.<br />
            <br />
             For months, she and her husband grappled with the pros
            and cons before they decided to have their son
            circumcised.<br />
            <br />
             "His father is circumcised, so we wanted him to look
            like his father," says Altemus, 27, of Jennersville,
            Pa. "Also, we knew friends who didn't circumcise their
            son and he felt so different from everyone else that he
            decided to have it done when he was in his
            teens."<br />
            <br />
             Circumcision used to be a routine step in the birthing
            process, much like cutting the umbilical cord.<br />
            <br />
             Advocates of the procedure point to research showing
            that circumcision lowers the risk of developing urinary
            tract infections and sexually transmitted diseases
            including AIDS.<br />
            <br />
             But foes of removing the penis foreskin argue that the
            procedure provides minimal benefits, causes extreme
            pain and produces long-term psychological and sexual
            trauma.<br />
            <br />
             "Circumcision violates every major tenet of medical
            practice, which is 'First, do no harm.' And secondly,
            modern medical ethics say parents do not have the right
            to ask for a medical procedure that is not in the best
            interest of their children," says Dr. Mark D. Reiss,
            retired physician and executive director of <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a> in
            Seattle.<br />
            <br />
             The <a href="http://www.aap.org"
            target="_blank">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> has
            maintained a fairly neutral <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/">policy</a>
            since 1999, saying that while circumcision has some
            potential health benefits associated with it, the
            procedure isn't medically necessary. Since then,
            Medicaid programs in 16 states have stopped covering
            circumcisions.<br />
            <br />
             Experts believe that the warm, moist area under the
            foreskin may be a breeding ground for infections,
            though they point out that lifestyle and hygiene have
            the biggest impact on health.<br />
            <br />
             "These studies have generated enough thought and
            concern for us to say we need to go back and review our
            policy and to do that earlier than we had planned,"
            says Dr. Jay Berkelhamer, president of the pediatrics
            academy.<br />
            <br />
             Despite the lack of a clear medical mandate, the
            United States leads the world in circumcisions,
            although the numbers are trending downward. Thirty
            years ago, 90 percent of American newborn boys were
            circumcised. Currently, around 60 percent undergo the
            procedure, according to 1999 data from the National
            Hospital Discharge Survey. Worldwide, 85 percent of
            males are uncircumcised.</p>
