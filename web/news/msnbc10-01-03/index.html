            <h4>Activists decry circumcision and offer
            `restoration' process</h4>

            <p class="author"><a
            href="mailto:jonbonne@feedback.msnbc.com">Jon
            Bonn&eacute;</a><br />
             <span class="arial">MSNBC</span></p>

            <p class="init">Oct. 1 &mdash; "I am covered and have
            overhang." R. Wayne Griffiths, 70 and a grandfather, is
            speaking frankly about his foreskin &mdash; which
            really is the only way one can speak on that topic.
            More to the point, he is gleefully describing the
            sensation of having his foreskin back after decades of
            living with a circumcised penis. "It's delightful," he
            says.</p>

            <p>AS HEAD OF the <a href="http://www.norm.org/"
            target="_blank">National Organization for Restoring
            Men</a>, Griffiths spends his days advocating that
            circumcised men reclaim what he suggests is their
            birthright: a penis unmolded by the will of others.</p>

            <p>Medically popularized in the early 20th century,
            circumcision has become a routine option for newborn
            American boys. But a backlash has surfaced in recent
            years, often bolstered by conflicting medical data
            about the procedure's benefits. Out of that debate has
            emerged a tiny but growing movement of men who not only
            oppose circumcision, but want back what they consider
            taken from them. They want to regrow their
            foreskin.</p>

            <p>The notion doesn't pass many peoples' laugh test.
            But NORM and similar groups are quite serious about
            straightforwardly counseling men on how to restore this
            tender bit of flesh. As they portray it, circumcision
            comprises an insidious conspiracy; in performing an
            unnecessary procedure, doctors are either ignorant or
            greedy; hospitals simply look the other way; parents
            don't know any better and are hounded into consent.</p>

            <p><b>`I KNEW THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG'</b><br />
             Foreskin restorers often trace the roots of their
            interest to childhood, perhaps to a moment in the
            locker room with an uncut classmate. "From the first
            time I noticed that a little boy was different than me,
            I knew that something was wrong with one of us ... and
            I assumed maybe it was him," says psychologist Jim
            Bigelow, author "The Joy of Uncircumcising," an
            authoritative text of sorts for restorers.</p>

            <p>That, in turn, could lead to shame. Born into an
            evangelical Christian family in 1933, Bigelow spent
            years as a boy trying to understand why he was
            circumcised &mdash; in part because he says the
            procedure left him with scars. "I figured I was born
            with something wrong with me and they had to fix it,"
            he says. "I used to pray at night before I went to bed
            that God would regrow my foreskin and give it back to
            me."</p>

            <p>For Griffiths, the desire to restore came more out
            from curiosity than frustration &mdash; though he
            regrets having his own sons circumcised in the 1950s.
            But he acknowledges many restorers "are just
            absolutely, almost violently angry at what has been
            done to them."</p>

            <p>That anger dovetails with the emotions that envelop
            the broader anticircumcision movement. Groups that
            fight the practice often endorse restoration and some
            have urged men to sue their doctors for circumcising
            them. But they primarily are concerned with educating
            parents and doctors whom they argue are doing
            irreparable harm.</p>

            <p>"You cannot cut off normal, healthy sexually
            functioning tissue without cutting off normal, healthy
            sexual functioning," says Marilyn Milos, a registered
            nurse and director of <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/"
            target="_blank">NOCIRC</a>, the National Organization
            of Circumcision Information Resource Centers. "It's a
            sexual issue, and it's a human rights issue."</p>

            <p><b>STRETCHING OUT</b><br />
             The foreskin, or <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/cold-taylor/">
            prepuce</a>, extends up from the penis shaft and covers
            its glans, or tip. It can protect the tender glans
            skin, and as men become sexually active it often serves
            as a buffer between the erect shaft and a partner's
            skin.</p>

            <p>Many baby boys have their foreskin removed through
            circumcision in the hours or days after their birth.
            Most are done in hospitals by doctors, though some are
            performed as religious rites. (Ritual circumcision
            exists in both the Jewish and Muslim religious
            traditions.) Some two-thirds of baby boys in the United
            States are estimated to undergo the procedure, a higher
            rate than most countries but down slightly from an
            estimated 80 percent in the 1970s.</p>

            <p>Whether foreskin removal changes the sensitivity of
            the penis remains a contentious topic. Those opposed to
            circumcision insist the extra skin makes a big
            difference, but a recent study by urologists found
            little difference in sensitivity in the penises of
            circumcised and uncircumcised men.</p>

            <p>As for bringing back a foreskin, those in the
            restoration movement describe two methods. They rarely
            discuss the first, perhaps because many harbor a deep
            distrust of doctors: skin tissue, usually from the
            scrotum, is surgically grafted to the penis shaft in a
            way that replicates the foreskin's shape and
            function.</p>

            <p>The other method essentially requires a man to
            stretch himself a new foreskin from his existing penis
            tissue. A variety of methods and devices help
            accomplish this &mdash; elastic bands, weighted metal
            containers, even special tape. Some are commercial
            products with names like P.U.D. (Penile Uncircumcision
            Device) and Tug Ahoy. Others are homemade with anything
            from silicon caulk to brass instrument mouthpieces.
            Several ounces of weights are sometimes added to speed
            the process.</p>

            <p>"Whatever the man can tolerate and not hurt
            himself," says Griffiths, who markets a device called
            Foreballs.</p>

            <p>All of these products basically distend the skin
            forward toward the glans and hold it in place to induce
            new cell growth, essentially forcing new skin to be
            created. Regrowth often takes years, with devices worn
            for 10 to 12 hours each day. Restorers claim it works
            best when periods of strain and rest are alternated
            &mdash; not unlike the way weight trainers rotate
            muscle groups over successive days.</p>

            <p>"If you're committed enough and you're determined
            enough you can get it done," says Bigelow, who used a
            tape method. "But it can be, for some men, a 5- or
            6-year procedure."</p>

            <p><b>SEEKING PLEASURE</b><br />
             Of course, it's impossible to truly restore foreskin
            and restorers admit results are partial at best.
            Certain specialized nerve endings simply won't return.
            For example, researchers have described a "ridged band"
            just inside a natural foreskin's tip of specialized
            nerve endings known as Meissner's corpuscles, which
            help detect light touch.</p>

            <p>Instead, restorers focus on what they can bring
            back: revived friction on the penis shaft and what some
            claim is the "dekeratinization" of the glans: thicker
            skin peels off and leaves a tender layer beneath.</p>

            <p>Nonetheless, restorers speak with quiet joy about
            their new foreskins. They describe heightened sexual
            sensation &mdash; increased sensitivity for a man, less
            friction for his partner. They insist that the newly
            covered glans can become more sensitive.</p>

            <p>Before he was restored, Griffiths says, those
            qualities made him envious. "I had to just absolutely
            beat myself to death, so to speak, to get feeling, to
            get some pleasure," says Griffiths. "The intact man
            just goes on forever. He enjoys the trip."</p>

            <p>But the real value, restorers insist, is a new sense
            of dignity. Language used by restorers and other
            anticircumcision activists at times resembles that used
            to describe the healing process for female rape victims
            or women whose clitorises were cut off in "female
            circumcision" procedures.</p>

            <p>The rhetorical similarities are clearly intentional.
            Milos starkly describes male circumcision as "the
            torture and mutilation of infants."</p>

            <p>As such, advocates of foreskin restoration like to
            frame the subject as primal empowerment, mirrored in
            flesh.</p>

            <p>Exact numbers are a mystery, but NORM holds regular
            meetings around the San Francisco Bay area &mdash; part
            how-to sessions and part support group.</p>

            <p>Says Griffiths: "There's emotional healing that goes
            on for many, many men that says, `I'm finally taking
            charge of my body ... I'm finally taking back what was
            taken from me without my consent.'"</p>

            <p><b>`DON'T GO NEAR THEM'</b><br />
             If restorers urge men to share the experience with
            loved ones, they are equally fervent when they argue it
            be done without a doctor's help. Most insist the
            medical community will be dismissive, if not outright
            hostile. On this point in particular, restorers
            reinforce the views of the broader anticircumcision
            movement.</p>

            <p>"Patients do call me and they want a doctor and I
            say: Don't go near them," says Dr. George Denniston,
            president of <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>.
            "They'll tell you you're crazy and you need psychiatric
            evaluation."</p>

            <p>Denniston and Milos both decry their experiences
            with medical circumcision, the training for which they
            describe as little more than an afterthought in
            obstetrics. The procedure, they argue, amounts to a
            violation of the "first, do no harm" precepts of modern
            medicine; its popularity in the medical community means
            parents can't possibly make informed decisions.</p>

            <p><b>A MEDICAL PUZZLE</b><br />
             Data on the medical value of circumcision largely
            remains inconclusive. Some studies suggest it improves
            hygiene and reduces incidence of STDs; other studies
            have found health problems associated with the
            procedure.</p>

            <p>In the past several years, medical groups have
            equivocated. Notably, the American Academy of
            Pediatrics reevaluated the practice in <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/">1998</a>
            and essentially refused to endorse it. The American
            Medical Association came to the same <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2000/">conclusion</a>
            a year later, noting circumcision was a choice often
            made "on social and cultural rather than medical
            concerns."</p>

            <p>Both groups underscored ethical precepts surrounding
            circumcision: anesthesia is essential, parents should
            take an active role in deciding whether to have it done
            and doctors need to accurately state the medical logic
            on either side.</p>

            <p>Circumcision has its own fervent advocates. <a
            href="http://www.medicirc.org/aboutus/medicirc_qualifications.html"
             target="_blank">Dr. Edgar Schoen</a>, a longtime
            pediatrician and researcher in Oakland, Calif., not
            only remains unswayed about the procedure's benefits
            but also serves as a foil of sorts to the
            anticircumcisers. As author of the AAP's <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap/#a1989">
            previous position</a> on circumcision in 1989, which
            largely praised its benefits, he remains what could
            charitably be called dismissive of restoration.</p>

            <p>"It's not a serious medical procedure," he says.
            "The people who are involved in this have a lot of
            problems that are not related to the foreskin."</p>

            <p>As for the stretching process, few medical concerns
            are raised since it mimics well-tested methods to grow
            skin. "But you've got to spend a lot of time on
            stretching," says Dr. Ira Sharlip, a San Francisco
            urologist and spokesman for the <a
            href="http://www.auanet.org/" target="_blank">American
            Urological Association</a>. "It's not a very practical
            thing to do."</p>

            <p>Sharlip says a patient may occasionally inquire
            about surgical restoration &mdash; which really amounts
            to cosmetic surgery &mdash; but few urologists have
            regularly dealt with the issue. "The great majority of
            men have no problems with having been circumcised," he
            says, even if fewer parents are now choosing it for
            their children. Foreskin restorers see it differently.
            They believe most men are simply too afraid to address
            an unquestionably awkward topic.</p>

            <p>"Most men who do suffer, who are troubled by what
            was done to them, suffer in silence," says Bigelow. "If
            we didn't have what is this foolish tradition in our
            culture, we wouldn't have to do this."</p>
