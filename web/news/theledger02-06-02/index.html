      <h1>Board Fines Doctor for Mistake</h1>

      <h4>Dr. Eva Salamon must pay $5,000 plus expenses, and
      perform community service.</h4>

      <p><i>Wednesday, February 6, 2002</i></p>

      <p>LAKELAND -- The <a
      href="http://www.stateofflorida.com/florboarofme.html">Florida
      Board of Medicine</a> imposed a $5,000 fine on Dr. Eva
      Salamon, a Winter Haven obstetrician, for doing a
      circumcision on a baby boy without the parents' consent.</p>

      <p>She must give a one-hour lecture on wrong-patient surgery,
      do 20 hours of community service and take five additional
      hours of continuing education in risk management. She also
      will pay $889.70 in costs for investigating the situation, an
      investigation that took place after <a
      href="http://www.winterhavenhospital.org/">Winter Haven
      Hospital</a> filed a serious incident report.</p>

      <p>She and the <a href="http://www.fdhc.state.fl.us/">Agency
      for Health Care Administration</a>, which investigates
      complaints for the <a
      href="http://www.doh.state.fl.us/">Department of Health</a>,
      had agreed on those terms in a proposed consent agreement
      given the Florida Board of Medicine on Friday. The board
      accepted the consent agreement.</p>

      <p>Salamon said she isn't at liberty to talk about the
      situation, other than to confirm the board's action.</p>

      <p>The boy was born at 8:25 a.m. Nov. 25, 2000. The surgery
      took place at 10:30 a.m. the next day, according to the
      agency's investigative report.</p>

      <p>The Ledger, using incorrect information in a draft
      complaint from the agency, reported last week that the baby
      was 2 months old when circumcised.</p>

      <p>The hospital's policy at that time was for nursing staff
      to confirm that a signed consent form was in the patient's
      chart before a physician did a circumcision, according to the
      investigative report.</p>

      <p>The report said Linda Bradway, the hospital's risk
      manager, said the staff didn't do that Nov. 26, 2000, but
      that the policy and procedures were revised afterward to make
      sure a consent form is present.</p>

      <p>It also quoted notes written by Salamon that state:
      "Circumcision was performed on this infant without a permit.
      I went to speak to the mother and explained the mistake.
      Circumcision was uncomplicated."</p>
