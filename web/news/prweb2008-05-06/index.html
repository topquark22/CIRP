            <h2>Male Circumcision Ineffective in HIV Battle
            According to New Future HIV Therapy Report</h2>

            <p><i>Promoting male circumcision in Africa is risky
            and dangerous and could lead to more HIV infections,
            warns a new paper published today in the May issue of
            Future HIV Therapy. Promoting circumcision will drain
            millions, possibly billions, of dollars away from more
            effective prevention strategies, and cause tens of
            thousands of infections and other surgical
            complications.</i><br />
            <br />
             West Lafayette, IN (PRWEB) May 6, 2008 &ndash;
            Promoting male circumcision in Africa is risky and
            dangerous and could lead to more HIV infections, warns
            a new <a
            href="http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/17469600.2.3.193"
             target="_blank">paper</a> published in the May issue
            of <i>Future HIV Therapy</i>.<br />
            <br />
             Lead author Dr. Lawrence Green says, "Having served on
            both the US Preventive Services Task Force and the
            Community Preventive Services Task Force, which do
            systematic reviews of research to arrive at
            government-supported evidence-based guidelines for
            practice, I believe the African studies on the basis of
            which some are promoting circumcision as HIV prevention
            would be classified at best as 'insufficient
            evidence&rsquo; by both panels."<br />
            <br />
             "Promoting circumcision will drain millions, possibly
            billions, of dollars away from more effective
            prevention strategies," cautions co-author John Travis,
            MD, "and cause tens of thousands of infections and
            other surgical complications, further straining an
            already overwhelmed healthcare system and undermining
            the current ABC (abstinence, be faithful, and use
            condoms) campaigns by creating a false sense of
            immunity and increasing risk-taking behaviors. African
            males are already lining up to be circumcised,
            believing that they will no longer need to wear
            condoms, and this is a serious concern."<br />
            <br />
             Travis says, "The African studies were conducted in
            atypically sanitary clinics with highly skilled
            operators and cannot be extrapolated to the general
            population. The studies have been criticized for their
            poor science including: the men were paid to be
            circumcised, received free condoms and extensive
            education, and the studies were halted after only 21 to
            24 month periods."<br />
            <br />
             During the course of these studies, 77 fewer
            circumcised than uncircumcised males contracted HIV,
            however, the circumcised group needed to refrain from
            sex to recoup from surgery, and they were receiving
            extensive monitoring and counseling about sexual
            behavior. Also, hundreds of study participants were
            lost to follow-up. "There is not enough evidence to
            conclude circumcision would offer any real long-term
            benefit in the HIV battle. Even if circumcision did
            reduce the risk of HIV infections, condoms and safe-sex
            practices are still far more effective. If an
            individual is engaging in high-risk behavior, he and
            his partner are at risk, regardless of whether he is
            circumcised or not."<br />
            <br />
             The paper also cautions against neonatal circumcision
            for HIV prevention, stating it is unethical to
            circumcise an infant for a possible benefit 15&ndash;20
            years later, if at all, to reduce the risk of
            contracting an adult-acquired disease for which there
            are far more effective prevention strategies
            available.<br />
            <br />
             Circumcision proponents, hailing from English-speaking
            countries, have been intensely lobbying world health
            agencies to adopt male circumcision as an additional
            HIV-prevention tool based on the release of three
            African randomized clinical trials reporting reduced
            HIV infections during their study periods.<br />
            <br />
             Many sources of data contradict the claim that
            circumcision protects against HIV. The United States
            has one of the highest rates of circumcision and HIV
            infection in the developed world. European nations,
            which rarely practice circumcision, have very low rates
            of HIV. Numerous regions in Africa show higher rates of
            HIV in circumcised populations compared to
            uncircumcised populations. For example, 2004 data from
            Lesotho show HIV infection of 15 percent for
            uncircumcised males and 23 percent for circumcised
            males. A 2007 study showed that, once commercial sex
            worker patterns were taken into consideration,
            circumcision status was irrelevant in HIV infection
            rates.</p>
