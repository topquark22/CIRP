      <h2>Teen Critical After Circumcision Goes Wrong</h2>
      <i>Updated 11:30 AM ET August 9, 2000</i>

      <p>NAIROBI, Kenya (Reuters) - A Kenyan teenage boy was in
      critical condition after his penis was cut off in a botched
      circumcision, a Kenyan newspaper reported Wednesday.</p>

      <p>The People newspaper said the 13-year old -- a member of
      the Luhya tribe of western Kenya -- had collapsed after a
      tribal elder mistakenly hacked off his whole penis instead of
      just the foreskin.</p>

      <p>"The boy, who had braved the chilly morning to face the
      sharp blade...cried out aloud and writhed in pain, teeth
      bared as he saw all the treasures he had carefully preserved
      for the big day drop to the polythene bag he was standing
      on," the newspaper said.</p>

      <p>It said the circumciser had been severely beaten up by
      friends and relatives of the boy, and that a crowd had then
      surrounded him in a thatched hut chanting "kill him, kill
      him."</p>

      <p>Most tribes in Kenya practice traditional circumcision,
      with a ceremony marking the entry into manhood.</p>

      <p>Participants usually jump into a cold river to numb the
      pain before an elder removes the foreskin with a sharp
      blade.</p>
