            Sex</h2>

            <p>January 9, 2007<br />
             Posted to the web January 9, 2007</p>

            <p>Arthur Baguma<br />
             Kampala</p>

            <p>SCIENTISTS say there are several biological reasons
            why circumcision may decrease the transmission of
            HIV/AIDS. A new study carried out in Uganda and Kenya
            has re-confirmed this. The findings have generated
            mixed reactions from the public and medical
            experts.</p>

            <p>The argument is that the discovery should not be
            presented as a cure for HIV/AIDS. Uganda's success in
            the fight has been the clear and precise message that
            there is no cure for AIDS.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">President Yoweri Museveni has
            joined the voices of those warning that messages saying
            circumcision reduces the risk of HIV/AIDS could derail
            the AIDS fight.</span> The President's words have also
            been echoed by Ugandan scientists.</p>

            <p>Dr. David Serwada, the director <a
            href="http://www.mak.ac.ug/" target="_blank">Makerere
            University</a> <a href="http://www.iph.ac.ug/"
            target="_blank">Institute of Public Health</a> and
            Uganda's principal investigator in the studies, warns
            that the study should be understood in the right
            context.</p>

            <p>"When you say circumcision reduces acquisition by
            50% it does not mean it eliminates HIV/AIDS. <span
            class="yellow">It is just one component in our arm of
            prevention.</span> If you are circumcised then it is
            fine, but if you practice safe sex or abstain the
            better," Serwada said.</p>

            <p><b>Should Uganda consider a policy on
            circumcision?</b></p>

            <p>According to officials at the Uganda AIDS
            Commission, a policy is necessary in light of the study
            findings.</p>

            <p>Director General Dr. Kihumuro Apuuli warns that
            coming up with the policy is a complex issue that needs
            working in partnership with different stake-holders and
            the community.</p>

            <p>"Pertinent issues have to be examined. For instance
            is it viable? Who do you target in the circumstances?
            Do you go to every village and circumcise every man.
            What are the implications of implementing the policy in
            terms of human resource and infrastructure, for
            instance? The issue has to be examined extensively
            before a policy is put in place."</p>

            <p>A US report said that circumcision can halve the
            HIV-infection rate.</p>

            <p>Kevin de Cock, head of the World Health
            Organisation's HIV/AIDS department, said circumcision
            could cut the numbers of infected men by "many tens of
            thousands, many hundreds of thousands and maybe
            millions over coming years."</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.iph.ac.ug/"
            target="_blank">Ministry of Health</a> officials said
            they were expecting to receive the report and carefully
            study it before taking the next move.</p>

            <p>"Coming up with a policy on circumcision will be
            considered after we have extensively studied the
            report," Dr. Sam Okware, the Director of Health
            Services, said.</p>

            <p><b>How many people would afford the cost of
            circumcision?</b></p>

            <p>The Government has to put incentives in place if
            such a policy is to work. The Government can consider
            subsidising circumcision services. Out of desperation,
            people will resort to crude unhygienic measures and
            this will escalate the problem.</p>

            <p>According to Siraje Mbulambago, the hospital
            administrator at Kibuli, circumcision charges range
            from sh25,000 to about sh1,000,000. These figures are
            out of reach for the ordinary person.</p>

            <p>At Kibuli Hospital, children aged five years and
            below are charged sh25,000 - sh30,000. For five and a
            half years and above it is sh50,000. Siraje says in
            some specialist centres the cost is as high as
            sh1m.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">On the contrary if not done
            safely, circumcision can increase chances of
            contracting HIV.</span></p>

            <p>It should be done in a safe environment at health
            centres, which is why the Government has to come up
            with a policy to provide these services.</p>

            <p>If services are not provided, the people should be
            given opportunities to go elsewhere. We have had cases
            where one knife is used on more than one person.</p>

            <p>Secondly, such services are accompanied by health
            safety measures, Siraje said.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">However, the report warns that
            people should not slip up on the need to continue to
            protect themselves by condom use and safe
            sex.</span></p>

            <p><span class="yellow">The public is warned that
            findings do not mean circumcision prevents HIV/AIDS,
            but only reduces the chances of contracting the
            virus.</span></p>

            <p><b>At a glance</b></p>

            <p>38.6 million people were living with HIV last year,
            of whom 24.5 were in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

            <p>In some African countries more than a third of the
            population is infected with HIV/AIDS.</p>

            <p>4.1 million became infected with the virus during
            the course of the year 2006 - 2.7 million in
            sub-Saharan Africa. UN agencies are calling for more
            efforts on prevention.</p>

            <p>2.8 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses in
            2005.</p>

            <p>Around 8.3 million people in Asia are HIV infected,
            two-thirds in India.</p>
