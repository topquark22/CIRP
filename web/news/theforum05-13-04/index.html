            <h2>Supreme Court hears circumcision appeal</h2>

            <h4>N.D. justices take up constitutional question</h4>

            <p>By Janell Cole <a
            href="mailto:forumcap@btinet.net">forumcap@btinet.net</a></p>

            <p>BISMARCK--If North Dakota criminal law protects
            girls from having their genitals subjected to
            unnecessary or mutilating surgery, so should healthy,
            normal baby boys be spared circumcision, attorney <a
            href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a> argued to the <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us"
            target="_blank">North Dakota Supreme Court</a> on
            Wednesday.</p>

            <p>The justices quizzed Baer, who represents Anita
            Flatt of Hawley, Minn., about what is on trial in the
            case against a Fargo doctor, <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Medical Center</a> and the
            state of North Dakota.</p>

            <p>Flatt and her late husband said they'd been given
            too little information before permitting their son to
            be circumcised one day after his birth in 1997.</p>

            <p>The Flatts lost in a trial last year in the Cass
            County <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/COURT/DISTRICTS/EC.HTM"
            target="_blank">District Court</a> after jurors
            decided MeritCare Dr. <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734"
            target="_blank">Sunita Kantak</a> had given the Flatts
            sufficient information to make an informed
            decision.</p>

            <p>The trial judge dismissed the state and MeriCare
            from the case, leaving the jury to decide only the
            claim against the doctor. Flatt now seeks a new
            trial.</p>

            <p>"What's on trial?" asked Chief Justice <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/VandeWalle.htm"
            target="_blank">Gerald VandeWalle</a>. "Is it your
            intent to try whether circumcision is medically
            necessary?"</p>

            <p>Baer said it is a matter of removing body part
            without any medical diagnosis.</p>

            <p>Justice <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/Neumann.htm"
            target="_blank">William Newman</a> said he understood
            the practice of circumcision to have 'medical pros and
            cons'.</p>

            <p>"Genital tissue is a constitutionally protected
            right,&rdquo; Baer said.</p>

            <p>The Flatts' allegation that the state's 1995 law
            banning female genital mutilation is unconstitutional,
            because it gives rights to girls not enjoyed by baby
            boys. That argument was thrown out before the trial
            started. East Central District <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/Rothe-Seeger.htm"
            target="_blank">Judge Cynthia Rothe-Seeger</a> agreed
            with the assistant attorney general that the
            Flatts&rsquo; son had no standing to the question the
            law&rsquo;s constitutionality.</p>

            <p>That seemed curious to Justice <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/Sandstrom.htm"
            target="_blank">Dale Sandstrom</a>. "If this plaintiff
            doesn't have standing, who does?" he asked state <a
            href="http://www.ag.state.nd.us/CL/cl.htm"
            target="_blank">Solicitor General</a> Douglas Bahr, who
            argued in favor of the law. Sandstrom wondered how a
            law specifically protecting girls wouldn't be as
            suspect as one written to protect white children but
            not black or American Indian children.</p>

            <p>"The legislative intent is pretty clearly to protect
            female children," Sandstrom said.</p>

            <p>Sandstrom also asked the doctor's attorney, <a
            href="http://www.vogellaw.com/fsl5cs/XMLAttorneyProfile.asp?guid=I30B624CE1DD211B2A40BB0001207C554&amp;ind_wld_id=3185802"
            target="_blank">Angela Lord</a>, why some of Flatt's
            expert witnesses were not allowed to testify as
            extensively as Baer wanted during the trial. Lord said
            they did testify. But, she said, those doctors believe
            circumcision should be outlawed and don't perform the
            procedure. So they have no relevant basis to testify on
            "standard of practice&rdquo; regarding informed consent
            for the surgery.</p>

            <p>The justices will later issue a decision.</p>

            <p>Baer said a London filmmaker spend two weeks in
            North Dakota earlier this year working on a documentary
            about the high rate of 'circumcision--85-95 percent--in
            the Midwest. He said the Flatt case is being watched
            worldwide. Less than half of 1 percent of boys in the
            United Kingdom are circumcised, Baer said in his court
            brief.</p>
