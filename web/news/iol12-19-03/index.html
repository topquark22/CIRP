            <h2>Boys lose penises after botched circumcisions</h2>

            <p>Five youths have had their penises amputated after
            botched circumcisions in the Eastern Cape since the
            beginning of November, the provincial health department
            said on Friday.</p>

            <p>Spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said four of the
            amputations were performed at a hospital in Lusikisiki
            in Pondoland, and the fifth in the Hewu area near
            Queenstown.</p>

            <p>The youths were victims of traditional surgeons
            running illegal circumcision schools, which the
            department is fighting to eliminate.</p>

            <p>In terms of provincial legislation a traditional
            surgeon or incibi must register with the department.
            Individual schools must also be registered.</p>

            <table width="130" border="0" cellspacing="6"
            cellpadding="0" align="left" summary="">
              <tr>
                <td><span class="quote"><b>'The youths were victims
                of traditional surgeons'</b></span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Kupelo said the total number of incibi and
            traditional nurses arrested for failing to comply with
            the act stands at 22 for this circumcision season.</p>

            <p>One surgeon was currently appearing in the
            Burgersdorp magistrate's court.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">"Some of them are also facing
            possible charges of culpable homicide," he
            said.</span></p>

            <p><span class="yellow">The number of deaths had risen
            to 12 with three more over the weekend in the
            Whittlesea area.</span> Though those three had attended
            different schools, it was believed they were all
            circumcised by one surgeon, who had been arrested.</p>

            <p>A total of 221 youths had been "rescued" from
            illegal schools, of whom 81 were admitted to hospital,
            where they were being housed in temporary
            structures.</p>

            <table width="130" border="0" cellspacing="6"
            cellpadding="0" align="left" summary="">
              <tr>
                <td><b><span class="quote">'The number of deaths
                had risen to 12'</span></b></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>"We believe that if we did not adopt this pro-active
            approach, we would have more deaths than we have now,"
            Kupelo said.</p>

            <p>Commenting on a claim by one traditional leader that
            youths who did not complete the full ritual at a school
            could not graduate as men and faced ostracism, he said
            that as far as the department was concerned, this was
            not the case.</p>

            <p>"I think they become men because they are
            circumcised, that thing (foreskin) has been removed,"
            he said.</p>

            <p>"There are parents who are taking their kids to
            hospital so that it can be done the Western way. No one
            has ever disputed that they are men."</p>

            <p>These youngsters went on to a school after the
            operation, he said.</p>

            <p>The traditional leaders who were custodians of the
            ritual had to understand that they needed to make sure
            it was done properly, and restore its dignity.</p>

            <p>"We don't want to interfere with the ritual part of
            it, but if these boys are dying, if they end up in our
            hospitals, let's adopt the pro-active approach," he
            said. - Sapa</p>
