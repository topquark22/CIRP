            <h2>Initiation schools closed</h2>

            <p>Polokwane (Pietersburg) - The <a
            href="http://www.limpopo.gov.za/"
            target="_blank">Limpopo provincial government</a> had
            by Friday closed down a total of eight illegal
            initiation schools after a boy from the Mokgolobotho
            village initiation school died last weekend.</p>

            <p>The Limpopo closures follow the deaths earlier this
            week of five initiates, the hospitalisation of more
            than 50 and the closure of two initiation schools in
            the Heidelberg area.</p>

            <p>Lucky Nchabeleng, a spokesperson for the MEC in the
            premier's office, said the owner of the school in
            Mokgolobotho village where the initiate had died, was
            arrested on Wednesday.</p>

            <p>All the schools that the province closed were
            operating without approval from the province as
            stipulated in the 1994 traditional circumcision schools
            act, Nchabeleng said.</p>

            <p>Nchabeleng also said 21 initiates were taken to
            hospital from an initiation school in Khtjwana village
            and another 53 initiates from Mokgolobotho were also
            hospitalised.</p>

            <p>"These schools... were illegal.</p>

            <p><b>70 legal schools</b></p>

            <p>"We have about 70 legal schools in the province and
            there's no reports that anyone has died at them,"
            Nchabeleng said.</p>

            <p>According to Nchabeleng, the initiates, many of
            whose wounds were septic and bloody, had been exposed
            to extreme cold and had even been denied access to
            water in some cases.</p>

            <p>"In the legal schools there is a certain degree of
            involvement of modern medical equipment, they use
            knifes but those knifes have been sterilised," he
            added.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, SABC news reported on Friday that the
            Congress of Traditional Leaders in South Africa
            (Contralesa) criticised the Limpopo government for
            closing down the schools.</p>

            <p>Contralesa reportedly said the government acted
            irresponsibly and that the perpetrators should have
            been punished instead of closing down the schools.</p>

            <p>Setlamorago Thobejane, chairperson of Contralesa,
            reportedly complained that the schools were closed
            without Contralesa or the National House of Traditional
            Leaders (NHTL) being consulted.</p>

            <p>The NHTL earlier said that they had long been asking
            the <a href="http://www.gpg.gov.za/"
            target="_blank">Gauteng government</a> to take measures
            to stop the mushrooming of schools and people posing as
            "ingcubi" (surgeons).</p>

            <p>According to NHTL, the problem could only be solved
            if traditional leaders, together with government,
            developed a national Act that controlled the running of
            the schools.</p>

            <p><b>No problem with tradition</b></p>

            <p>But according to Nchabeleng, the legislature, at
            least in the Limpopo province, was already in place and
            the task at hand was monitoring the schools and closing
            down illegal ones.</p>

            <p>"We as the government have no problem with this
            tradition... we think it is one of the core values of
            African culture which must be upheld.</p>

            <p>"But we have a problem when people carry out
            tradition in a way that impacts on human rights.</p>

            <p>"We cannot afford to live with this as the
            government because the government is the custodian of
            the people.</p>

            <p>"These people are dying because when they get
            circumcised there is no medication to sterilise the
            instruments.</p>

            <p>"We feel there must be co-operation here between
            government and tradition," Nchabeleng said.</p>
