            <h2>Mom: Dad showed son photos of circumcision</h2>

            <p><i>June 15, 2006</i></p>

            <p><b>BY STEVE PATTERSON, Staff Reporter</b></p>

            <p>An Arlington Heights man showed his 8-year-old son
            graphic pictures of a circumcision in progress as part
            of an effort to prevent the boy's mother from having
            him circumcised.</p>

            <p>The man also told his son he could <a
            href="/library/complications/gearhart1/">lose his
            penis</a>, be left with a limp or <a
            href="/library/death/">die from the procedure</a>, the
            mother testified Wednesday.</p>

            <p>The mother, who is remarried and lives in
            Northbrook, said her ex-husband refused to have their
            son circumcised at birth because he said their son is
            "not a Jew."</p>

            <p>They are in court battling over whether the boy
            needs to have the foreskin on his penis removed to
            prevent recurring infections.</p>

            <p>The father denies making anti-Semitic remarks but
            admits he printed information off the Internet for his
            son, to accompany a letter he helped his son write,
            asking his mother not to circumcise him.</p>

            <p>Cook County Judge Jordan Kaplan will issue a ruling
            in August.</p>

            <p>The boy's pediatrician, Dr. Arnold Goldstein, as
            well as <a
            href="http://www.medschool.northwestern.edu/depts/urology/faculty/kaplan.html"
             target="_blank">Dr. William Kaplan</a>, head of
            urology at <a href="http://www.childrensmemorial.org/"
            target="_blank">Children's Memorial Hospital</a>, both
            recommend circumcision to prevent the painful redness,
            swelling and cracking his mother says he has endured
            four times since 2004.</p>

            <p>The boy's father, however, flew in experts who say
            better hygiene and medication will help the boy.</p>

            <p>Nearly all of his attorneys and experts are serving
            him for free or via a fund set up by a national
            anti-circumcision organization.</p>

            <p>Court records show the father has twice been held in
            contempt and sentenced to jail for failing to help pay
            the boy's medical bills.</p>

            <p>He faced a contempt ruling going into this hearing,
            but Tuesday, he paid past-due bills to lift that
            ruling.</p>

            <p>Tracy Rizzo, attorney for the boy's mother, said
            that pattern, coupled with the father's overall lack of
            involvement in the boy's medical care, shows he's
            pursuing a case driven by politics rather than the
            boy's best interest.</p>

            <p><b>Rate lowest since '70s</b></p>

            <p>The National Center for Health Statistics said that
            in 2003, <a href="/library/statistics/USA/">55.9
            percent of all male babies were circumcised in the
            United States</a> -- the lowest rate since at least the
            1970s.</p>

            <p>That has driven a vocal anti-circumcision effort,
            but Georgia attorney <a
            href="http://www.lawyers.com/lawyers/Atlanta/Georgia/David%20J.%20Llewellyn/attorney.html?a=0761-LDS&amp;co=&amp;b=A101006875805"
             target="_blank">David Llewellyn</a>, representing the
            father with <a href="http://www.ltddivorce.com/"
            target="_blank">Alan Toback and John D'Arco</a>,
            insists that is not what this case is about.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Llewellyn said the mother
            simply wants the boy circumcised so he can look more
            like his stepfather and stepbrother, who are
            circumcised.</span></p>

            <p>Llewellyn also implied the boy has touched or at
            least seen his 11-year-old stepbrother's penis.</p>

            <p>"Who has what status and who looks like whom" is the
            real issue, Llewellyn said in court.</p>

            <p>The father testified the boy has never complained to
            him about pain near his penis, but the mother got
            choked up as she described how her son "was crying
            profusely" and "very scared" when his penis became so
            irritated that he could not put on swim trunks or
            pants.</p>

            <p>"I don't want him to be in pain," the mother
            testified.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Llewellyn attributed the
            condition to poor hygiene or swimming in water with
            high chemical levels.</span></p>
