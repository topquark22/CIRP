            <p>Garda&iacute; were tonight searching for a man who
            carried out a circumcision on a baby boy who later
            died. The four-week-old baby was admitted to hospital
            after the operation at a house in Waterford city.</p>

            <p>Before reaching <a
            href="http://www.hebe.ie/Links/Hospitals/Waterford/"
            target="_blank">Waterford Regional Hospital</a> on
            Sunday night <span class="yellow">he lost a large
            amount of blood and later died.</span></p>

            <p>Medical staff contacted garda&iacute; to inform them
            of the death.</p>

            <p>The baby was understood to have Nigerian parents but
            was born in Ireland.</p>

            <p>His parents and their two daughters have lived in
            Waterford since last year.</p>

            <p>A post mortem examination proved inconclusive and
            doctors were waiting for further test results.</p>

            <p>Garda&iacute; questioned a number of people about
            the incident and were looking for the man who carried
            out the operation. He is no longer believed to be in
            the city.</p>
