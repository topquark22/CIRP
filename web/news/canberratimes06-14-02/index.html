      <h2>One in five kids suffers anxiety</h2>

      <p>BRISBANE: One in five Australian children suffers from
      serious anxiety and risk turning into depressed, suicidal
      teenagers, a conference heard yesterday.</p>

      <p>In a keynote address to an international child and
      adolescent mental health conference in Brisbane, Professor
      Paula Barrett, of Queensland's Griffith University, said the
      figures represented a world-wide trend in childhood
      anxiety.</p>

      <p>"We know from studies both in Australia, the US and a
      variety of countries in Europe that approximately one in
      every five children will experience a significant degree of
      impediment as a result of anxiety," she said.</p>

      <p>Childhood anxiety was a major psychological risk factor
      for depression and could lead to suicide - particularly in
      young males - without early intervention.</p>

      <p>Professor Barrett said schools should consider introducing
      "anti-anxiety" lessons as part of the curriculum to help turn
      the tide. "Early intervention or prevention of anxiety may be
      critical in the prevention of depression and suicide, and the
      school setting is obviously the best window of opportunity,"
      she said.</p>

      <p>Professor Barrett said family factors during early
      childhood and experiences in late primary school, such as
      bullying and lack of acceptance by peers, played a key role
      in childhood anxiety and depression.</p>

      <p>Some children also became particularly distressed by
      traumatic events that didn't touch them directly, such as
      reporting of the September 11 terrorist attacks, or the death
      of a classmate.</p>

      <p>She said there was evidence that some children were born
      more prone to stress and anxiety than others.</p>

      <p>She said if five children - as young as six months old -
      are taken into a room and the light is switched off, or a
      strange person enters the room, on average one will
      experience longer and more severe symptoms of stress such as
      increased heart rate, sweating and crying.</p>

      <p>However, this sensitivity could be mitigated by a stable,
      nurturing relationship with family and peers.</p>

      <p>"Being born sensitive seems to be a risk factor, but if
      you've got a supportive family and a supportive peer network,
      these are protective factors that help the child cope quite
      well with life," she said.</p>

      <p>Professor Barrett said sleep deprivation and
      over-stimulation could increase a child's sensitivity to
      stress.</p>

      <p>Beginning school too early, when a child was not socially
      or emotionally ready, could also cause anxiety problems, she
      said.</p>

      <p>The professor had devised a program for teaching primary
      and high school children how to become "emotionally
      articulate" in 1999.</p>

      <p>The program has gained international recognition and been
      successfully introduced into some Queensland schools.</p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Evidence is mounting that
      circumcision of baby boys can cause life-long psychological
      distress, according to a Queensland academic.</span></p>

      <p><span class="yellow"><a

      target="_blank">Professor Gregory Boyle</a>, of <a
      href="http://www.bond.edu.au/" target="_blank">Bond
      University</a>, said circumcised boys could suffer long-term
      symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder.</span></p>

      <p><span class="yellow">Professor Boyle <a
      href="/library/psych/boyle6/">reviewed recent studies</a> and
      concluded that many children who were circumcised for
      non-medical reasons were traumatised by the experience.
      "PTSD-like symptoms may even persist well into adult years,"
      he told the conference.</span></p>

      <p>Young people who play sport are more likely to practise
      safe sex than those who go to church, according to new
      research.</p>

      <p>The research into the sexual well-being of young
      Australians also found that people in the 17-19 age bracket
      who were sexually active were likely to be better adjusted
      than their virginal peers. The study, presented at the
      conference, said virgins had the lowest sense of sexual
      well-being - even below sexually active people who had
      experienced sexual harassment.</p>
