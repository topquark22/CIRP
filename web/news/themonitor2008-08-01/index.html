            <h2>The Other Face of Circumcision in HIV War</h2>

            <p><b>By Michael Bahinyoza</b></p>

            <p>The Geneva-based <a href="http://www.who.int/en/"
            target="_blank">World Health Organisation</a> has
            reportedly, over the last couple of months been leading
            UN Agencies (<a href="http://www.unaids.org/en/"
            target="_blank">UNAIDS</a>, <a
            href="http://www.unicef.org/"
            target="_blank">UNICEF</a>, <a
            href="http://www.unfpa.org/" target="_blank">UNFPA</a>)
            to support particularly African countries to develop
            male circumcision policies and strategies in the
            broader/ comprehensive HIV prevention strategy.<br />
            <br />
             This follows results from the three Randomised
            Controlled Trials (RCTs) undertaken in Kisumu (Kenya),
            Rakai (Uganda) and Orange Farm (South Africa) showing
            that male circumcision could reduce the risk of
            heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men by about
            60 per cent.<br />
            <br />
             According to media reports, Rwanda has already rolled
            out male circumcision in the military, a country where
            ironically, circumcised men have a higher rate of HIV
            than 'intact' men. (<a
            href="http://www.circumcisionandHIV.com"
            target="_blank">www.circumcisionandHIV.com</a>).<br />
            <br />
             A colleague told me last week, seven of his friends
            (all of them single) had been circumcised in this ended
            month of July and that the RCT findings had majorly
            influenced their decision. It is worth noting that
            because of information deficiency and other challenges,
            there have been a number of exaggerated claims made for
            the reported efficacy of male circumcision in
            preventing HIV infection.<br />
            <br />
             Many people are not even aware that the results from
            the above mentioned Randomised Controlled Trials are
            about prevention of female-to-male HIV infection.<br />
            <br />
             Secondly, not many young people (and probably adults
            as well) seem aware that the trial results clearly
            indicate that male circumcision reduces the risk of
            infection. Unfortunately, many young male adolescents
            and some men prefer reading or hearing reducing the
            risk as eliminating the risk.<br />
            <br />
             Undoubtedly, there is 'a heaven of difference' between
            risk reduction and risk elimination and hopefully, this
            can be well grasped in the preventive campaign against
            HIV/Aids.<br />
            <br />
             Reputable senior research fellows, Garry Dowsett and
            Murray Coach, from Australia suggest in their <a
            href="/library/disease/HIV/dowsett2007/"
            target="_blank">findings</a>; "The use of male
            circumcision in preventing HIV infection" that the
            results of the three RCTs contain exaggerated claims.
            In his work; "The Demonisation of the Foreskin and the
            Rise of Circumcision in Britain," Darby RJL, too,
            brings to the fore what he considers information that
            the respective supervisors of the three RCTs should not
            have ignored.<br />
            <br />
             Apparently it turns out that all the three RCTs were
            terminated early, arguably before the incidence of HIV
            infection in the circumcised males caught up with the
            incidence of infection in the non-circumcised
            males.<br />
            <br />
             It is therefore highly probable that non-circumcised
            males got infected more quickly than their circumcised
            friends because the circumcised males required a period
            of abstinence after circumcision, suggesting, among
            other things, likely that if the studies had continued
            as initially scheduled, the difference in infection
            incidence between the two groups of males would have
            been small.<br />
            <br />
             As has been noted by our own <a
            href="http://www.health.go.ug/"
            target="_blank">Ministry of Health</a>, male
            circumcision does not protect women. Since <a
            href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/342/13/921"
             target="_blank">viral load is the cardinal predictor
            of the risk of HIV transmission</a>, male circumcision
            would not reduce the viral load and thus infectivity to
            the female partner.<br />
            <br />
             For now, it may be wise for our own Ministry of
            Health, the medical fraternity and the public to be
            cautious and not to be overwhelmed by the <a
            href="/library/disease/HIV/vanhowe2005a/"
            target="_blank">'hyperbolic' promotion of male
            circumcision in HIV prevention</a>.<br />
            <br />
             Pre-marital chastity and fidelity, nurtured and
            supported by needed life skills within viable and
            dynamic support groups, remain time-tested HIV/AIDS
            preventive weaponry as the infected and affected are
            given needed care and support.<br />
