      <h2>Hearing on boy's surgery public</h2>
      <b>By CRISSA SHOEMAKER<br />
      Staff Writer</b> 

      <p><i>Published in the Courier News on December 5,
      2000</i></p>

      <p>Proceedings will decide whether a tot should be
      circumcised Since the controversy has already made headlines,
      the public can observe the hearings regarding the
      circumcision of a 3-year-old Central Jersey boy, a state
      Superior Court judge ruled Monday. The court-appointed
      attorney for the boy, Edward J. O'Donnell, said he would
      appeal Judge Paul Armstrong's ruling allowing the hearings to
      remain open.</p>

      <p>The hearings, which were scheduled to begin Monday in
      Somerville, were postponed until the end of January because
      of delays with some of the experts expected to testify on
      whether Matthew Price should be circumcised.</p>

      <p>O'Donnell, who gained fame as the attorney for the
      biological father in the Baby M surrogacy case in the 1980s,
      petitioned Armstrong to close the proceedings because of
      future embarrassment and psychological harm to the child.</p>

      <p>"I cannot think of anything which would be a more private
      fact than whether an individual has been circumcised or not,"
      O'Donnell said.</p>

      <p>Matthew Price's medical history was made public when his
      father, Jim Price of Raritan Borough, took his case to the
      media, pleading that the circumcision, ordered by Armstrong
      in August, not go forward.</p>

      <p>Armstrong had based his opinion on two medical reports
      that said circumcision would be the best way to alleviate
      recurring problems Matthew was experiencing.</p>

      <p>Mr. Price appealed the decision to the state Superior
      Court Appellate Division, which denied his request to hold a
      hearing. But the state Supreme Court took his appeal and sent
      the case back to Armstrong for a hearing.</p>

      <p>The case has drawn national attention, and the <a
      href="http://www.msnj.org/" target="_blank">Medical Society
      of New Jersey</a>, along with the Urological Society of New
      Jersey, filed friends-of-the-court briefs, as did the <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/" target="_blank">National
      Organization of Circumcision Resource Centers</a>, though its
      brief has yet to be accepted by the court.</p>

      <p>Ronald Heymann, attorney for the boy's mother, Jennifer
      Price of Clinton, who is seeking the surgery, also asked that
      the proceedings be closed to the public.</p>

      <p>"The final decision will have that purpose of notoriety,"
      Heymann said. "That should be kept private for this little
      boy."</p>

      <p>Mr. Price's attorney, Julie Marino, did not file a brief
      regarding the closure of the hearings, but said in court
      Monday that the proceedings should be kept open.</p>

      <p>Attorneys for the <a href="http://www.c-n.com/"
      target="_blank">Courier News</a> and the <a
      href="http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/index.ssf"
      target="_blank">Star Ledger</a> also argued against closing
      the hearings to the public. Both argued that the issue has
      been made public already, and closing the hearing would serve
      only to hurt the public, rather than protect the boy.</p>

      <p>Richard Ragsdale, the attorney for the Courier News, said
      the public interest in the case outweighs the "speculative
      injury" to Matthew.</p>

      <p>And the Star Ledger's lawyer, Donald Robinson, said:
      "There's no basis for you now to make a finding that there
      will be embarrassment of any sort."</p>

      <p>Armstrong said in his ruling that had the case not been
      made public, and if the application to close the proceedings
      been made earlier, he would have ruled differently.</p>

      <p>"This court would readily seal the record in hopes of
      preventing future psychological harm and embarrassment,"
      Armstrong said.</p>

      <p>During the hearings, scheduled for Jan. 23, 24, 30 and 31,
      experts will testify on whether Matthew's best interests
      would be served by the circumcision.</p>

      <p>Doctors Joseph Barone and Grace Calimlim, Matthew's
      treating physicians on whose reports the judge's initial
      decision was based, are expected to testify on his mother's
      behalf. Mr. Price has enlisted Dr. Robert Van Howe, a
      Wisconsin doctor who has written numerous articles on
      circumcision. O'Donnell will present testimony from Dr.
      Robert Pickens, a Princeton pediatric urologist designated as
      the court's expert.</p>

      <p>The hearings were delayed because a supplemental report by
      Barone had not been released by his attorney, and Van Howe
      had not yet examined Matthew. He was expected to do so
      Monday.</p>
