      <h2>Sixty Percent of Primary Age Children Not Enrolled</h2>
      <br />

      <p>Guinea-Bissau faces a daunting task to improve children's
      well being. While national immunisation coverage has
      improved, its 40 percent primary school enrollment was
      decreasing, the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/"
      target="_blank">UN High Commission for Human Rights</a>
      (UNHCHR) reported on Wednesday.</p>

      <p>"60 percent of school age children were not attending
      school, the rate of school dropouts was high, adequate health
      services were not available, and 90 percent of the health
      budget was from external financing," the report to the child
      rights committee of UNHCHR said.</p>

      <p>National immunisation rose from 37 percent in 1986 to 60
      percent in 1993, the report said, but traditional practices
      including early marriages and <span>circumcision of boys and
      girls were causing serious problems for children and
      women.</span></p>

      <p>"Girls are compelled to marry while still adolescents - 13
      to 14 years old. <span>Circumcision of boys aged 9-13 and
      girls 7-12 years, among the Fula and Mandinga ethnic groups
      are the most cruel and harmful practises. There are no
      effective measures at the national level to eliminate them,"
      the report said.</span></p>

      <p>Guinea-Bissau's Justice Minister Dionisio Cabi, told the
      committee that the country's 1.2 million people were among
      the poorest in the world, with 55 percent of the population
      under 18 years of age. The minister said the government had
      recognised the needs of the social sector.</p>

      <p>"Military and political conflict in 1998 and 1999
      destroyed the infrastructure in the country including
      schools, hospitals and roads. Mainly affected by this
      destruction were children and women," Cabi said, adding that
      strategies to address the problems were being developed,
      including ratification of international conventions.</p>

      <p>The government, Cabi told the committee, had also
      identified drug addiction, prostitution, child labour, child
      soldiers and the presence of landmines in the country as the
      other priority action areas. "The solutions lie in good
      governance, respect for human rights, the fight against
      corruption, and implementation of measures favouring the
      well-being of children," he said.</p>

      <p>The UNHCHR child rights committee which reviewed
      Guinea-Bissau's implementation of the provisions of the <a
      href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-convention/">Convention
      on the Rights of the Child</a> and expressed concern, will
      conclude its session on 7 June. The country signed the
      convention on 26 January 1990 and ratified it on 20 August
      1990.</p>
