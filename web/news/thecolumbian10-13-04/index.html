            <h2>Judge signs warrants for mom, son</h2>

            <p>Wednesday, October 13, 2004<br />
             <b>By STEPHANIE RICE, Columbian staff writer</b></p>

            <p>Judge <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/courts/superior/judges.html"
             target="_blank">James Rulli</a> signed arrest warrants
            for a Ridgefield mother and her 8-year-old son after
            they failed to show up Tuesday to speak with
            investigators.</p>

            <p>Tammy R. Baxter, 30, was supposed to report to Clark
            County <a href="" target="_blank">Superior Court</a> to
            discuss her husband's alleged attempt to circumcise
            their son last month.</p>

            <p>Her husband, Edwin B. Baxter, was arrested Sept. 3
            and remains in the Clark County <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/sheriff/custody/Index.html"
             target="_blank">Jail</a> on $50,000 bail.</p>

            <p>Baxter, a 33-year-old truck driver, has pleaded not
            guilty to second-degree assault of a child. The felony
            carries a penalty of up to three years and five months
            in prison for first-time offenders.</p>

            <p>His trial is set for Nov. 8.</p>

            <p>Rulli has appointed a psychologist to interview
            Baxter and determine if he's mentally competent to
            stand trial. Baxter allegedly said he tried to
            circumcise his son after reading the Old Testament.</p>

            <p>Since Baxter's arrest, law enforcement and
            investigators from the state <a
            href="http://www1.dshs.wa.gov/"
            target="_blank">Department of Children and Family
            Services</a> have been unsuccessful in locating
            Baxter's wife and their nine children.</p>

            <p>Tammy Baxter is believed to be pregnant with her
            10th child.</p>

            <p>Clark County Senior Deputy Prosecutor <a
            href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/pa/criminal/childabuse.html"
             target="_blank">Kim Farr</a> said Tuesday that he has
            spoken with the defendant's father, Bruce Baxter of
            Vancouver. Bruce Baxter said his daughter-in-law and
            grandchildren may be staying in Vancouver's Rosemere
            neighborhood, Farr said.</p>

            <p>Members of Rosemere's Humdingers easily identified
            because they wore matching shirts bearing their group's
            name showed up at Edwin Baxter's arraignment last
            month.</p>

            <p>Bruce Baxter and the Humdingers, however, have been
            on opposing sides of a long-running feud in Rosemere.
            In 2001, Baxter was among the <a
            href="http://www.rosemerena.org/"
            target="_blank">Rosemere Neighborhood Association</a>
            officers ousted by the Humdingers. Then, the
            Humdinger-dominated association was stripped of its
            city recognition in January because city officials were
            fed up with the group's behavior, which included
            blocking residents from attending neighborhood
            meetings.</p>

            <p>Farr said anyone providing shelter for Tammy Baxter
            and her son could be arrested for harboring
            fugitives.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.zanzoona.com/gurupadma.html"
            target="_blank">Guru Padma (MariJo) Donais</a>, the
            spiritual leader of the Humdingers, laughed off the
            suggestion anyone in her group would be harboring the
            Baxter family.</p>

            <p>"We would give them no shelter," Donais said. "We're
            not the type of group that would hide anyone from the
            law."</p>

            <p>She said she did not know which Humdingers attended
            the Sept. 17 arraignment. "I have a huge following over
            36,000 in Washington and Oregon," she said.</p>

            <p>Update</p>

            <p>Previously: Investigators have been unable to
            interview the family of a man who allegedly tried to
            circumcise his son, 8, after reading about circumcision
            in the Bible.</p>

            <p>What's new: A judge signed arrest warrants for the
            boy and his mother after they failed to report to
            court.</p>

            <p>What's next: If arrested, the mother and son could
            be held as material witnesses.</p>
