            <p>Umtata - A 14-year-old boy died at an initiation
            school at Mpoza village near Lusikisiki in the Eastern
            Cape on Saturday, police said on Monday.</p>

            <p>Superintendent Nondumiso Jafta said the boy,
            Phumlani Nonqalela, was one of six who were illegally
            circumcised. She said a man allegedly called the boys
            and circumcised them without their parents' permission.
            Moreover, the man was not a registered "ingcibi" or
            initiation teacher.</p>

            <p>The man, who was apparently well known, was likely
            to be arrested soon. He would be charged with murder,
            assault and unlawful circumcision, Jafta said.</p>
