              By Reynaldo O. Joson, MD and Rafael R. Castillo,
              MD</p>

              <p>Publish Date: [Tuesday, February 11, 2003]</p>
            </center>

            <p>Until recently, no one&mdash;including
            doctors&mdash;ever bothered to take a closer look at
            this issue. We always thought it was a long-answered
            question and that it was really medically necessary to
            have all males circumcised. But is it?</p>

            <p>Circumcision in males usually consists of removing
            part of the prepuce or foreskin of the penis. Its
            practice has various origins, both religious and
            non-religious, medical and non-medical. The reasons for
            the practice of circumcision in males have evolved from
            biblical practice.</p>

            <p>There is still the medical basis, especially for the
            Jews and Muslims (but this is not absolute anymore
            because there are now Jews and Muslims who object to
            male circumcision).</p>

            <p>There is still the medical basis, particularly the
            belief that circumcision can prevent urinary tract
            infection, penile and cervical cancer, and
            sexually-transmitted diseases. The sexual arguments for
            circumcision are based on the belief that circumcision
            offers more sexual enjoyment to both male and female
            partners.</p>

            <p>However, the predominant driving forces for
            circumcision in males are tradition and peer pressure.
            Male newborns are circumcised because of the
            parents' belief in the traditional practice. Male
            adolescents and even adults are also circumcised
            because of the traditional need ("passage rite to
            manhood") and peer pressure (afraid to be teased as
            <i>supot</i>).</p>

            <p>An objective, scientific and dispassionate look is
            therefore necessary to answer the question: Is
            circumcision in males really necessary?</p>

            <p>On the basis of medical reasons, routine
            circumcision in males is NOT necessary. The American
            Academy of Pediatrics has done extensive critical
            analysis of all published papers on the topic and has
            come out with a <a
            href="/library/statements/aap1999/">stand</a> in 1999
            that routine circumcision in males is not
            necessary.</p>

            <p>On the issue of urinary tract infection, penile and
            cervical cancers, circumcision may have a potential
            benefit in terms of prevention but its actual value is
            minimal because of the low occurrence of these dreaded
            consequences. In other words, the risk is extremely low
            if circumcision is not done and thus, routine
            circumcision is not necessary.</p>

            <p>On the issue of sexually-transmitted diseases,
            prevention should focus on the behavioral factors
           &mdash;that is, avoiding promiscuity and careless sex
           &mdash;rather than relying on circumcision. On the
            question of hygiene, promotion can be done with
            meticulous mechanical cleansing without having to
            resort to the invasive and painful procedure of
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>The most common and most clear-cut medical
            indication for male circumcision is now limited to
            patients with urinary infection secondary to phimosis
            (extremely small opening of the prepuce or foreskin of
            the penis).</p>

            <p>Paraphimosis (tightness of the foreskin that tends
            to strangle the penis) can be another medical
            indication if it occurs. Other than these situations,
            medical-wise, circumcision in males is not
            necessary.</p>

            <p>In the Philippines, the Christian religions do not
            require routine circumcision anymore. For the Muslims
            and Jews, it may still be advocated but it is no longer
            an absolute requirement. There are even websites put up
            by Jewish and Muslim authors crusading against
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>The debatable issue on sexual enjoyment maybe a myth
            after all. Although there are no conclusive findings
            yet, a most recent scientific <a
            href="/library/anatomy/ohara/">article</a> on the issue
            shows that more sexual enjoyment is felt by the female
            partners with non-circumcised than with circumcised
            men. The enjoyment is scientifically validated.</p>

            <p>However, not only are the doctors the key opinion
            molders in this issue. The voice of the parents and
            even the children will be stronger&mdash;in fact,
            strongest. If they are convinced about the
            non-necessity of circumcision, they should also voice
            out their stand on it for the sake of their children,
            grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great
            grandchildren.</p>
