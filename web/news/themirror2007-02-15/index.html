             <small>Exclusive by : Stephen Moyes</small></h2>

            <p>DETECTIVES are investigating the death of a
            seven-day-old baby after he was circumcised.</p>

            <p>Stunned relatives at the Jewish ceremony saw the
            toddler experience breathing difficulties.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">He was taken to hospital but
            died eight days later. A post mortem found the infant
            died from cardiac arrest and oxygen
            starvation.</span></p>

            <p>Police are to interview family members and the
            senior rabbi who performed the operation at <a href=""
            target="_blank">Golders Green Synagogue</a> in North
            London. Concerns raised by doctors treating the baby
            have led to the probe being led by Scotland Yard's
            child abuse investigators.</p>

            <p>Police and <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/"
            target="_blank">Home Office</a> sources said the
            investigation was "highly unusual".</p>

            <p>A <a href="http://www.met.police.uk/"
            target="_blank">Scotland Yard</a> spokesman stated:
            "The death is being treated as unexplained at this
            early stage."</p>

            <p>The baby died two weeks ago at <a
            href="http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/"
            target="_blank">University College Hospital</a>,
            Central London.</p>

            <p>Circumcision of boys is an operation in which the
            foreskin is removed from the penis. With small babies,
            local anaesthetic is often sufficient and avoids the
            risks of a general anaesthetic.</p>

            <p>Some people believe the skin is redundant and gets
            in the way of hygiene.</p>

            <p>Others say it is a vital part of the male anatomy
            and should not be removed.</p>

            <p>Judaism considers circumcision to be an important
            ritual. The operation is usually performed by a mohel -
            a specialist in the procedure and its rituals.</p>

            <p>Many British mohels are doctors, rabbis or both. All
            have received appropriate medical and religious
            training.</p>

            <p>A spokesman for <a
            href="http://www.unitedsynagogue.org.uk/"
            target="_blank">The United Synagogue</a>, a membership
            of 35 orthodox synagogues in Greater London, said: "We
            are awaiting the results of the police enquiry and
            until then it would not be appropriate for us to
            comment further."</p>
