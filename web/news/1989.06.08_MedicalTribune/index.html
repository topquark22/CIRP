        <h2>FORGET THOSE HEADLINES ABOUT CIRCUMCISION</h2>

        <h3>AAP IS AGAINST ROUTINE CIRCUMCISION</h3>

        <p><b>By James Trager</b></p>
      </div>

      <p>Newspaper headlines across the country in early March
      [1989] rang variations on the theme that circumcision had
      regained favor in the eyes of the medical establishment.
      Wrong: the American Academy of Pediatrics still opposes
      routine circumcision for male infants. Its <a
      href="/library/statements/aap/#a1971">1971 position</a>, that
      it finds "no valid medical indications" for routine
      circumcision, remains intact.</p>

      <p>"We have not reversed our position," said Donald W.
      Schiff, M. D., professor of pediatrics at the University of
      Colorado in Denver and president of the AAP. "We've changed
      it a bit, but its really just a bit. I think that the
      distinction we're making is that there is some new data which
      suggests that the subject needs reexamination and further
      examination and further examination but that, and I think I
      said that, there may be some advantage to doing circumcision,
      but I think the data is still indefinite enough that we're
      not making a real change of any significance. We're making a
      slight change. We sort of opening the door a crack, so to
      speak saying, "We need to reexamine on the issue and
      reidentify the data so that we know just what the facts are.
      We don't have them all yet."</p>

      <p>What the AAP did was throw a sop to advocates of routine
      circumcision. According to the academy's statement, the
      procedure "has potential medical benefits and advantages."
      The New York Times seized upon this and headlined its story,
      "Pediatricians Find Medical Benefit to Circumcision." Said a
      subhead: "The group reverses an earlier position. "Other
      papers followed the same line. But there was no reversal. If
      circumcision has potential medical benefits and advantages,"
      it also has inherent disadvantages and risks," according to
      the AAP statement.</p>

      <p>In reviewing retrospective studies conducted in 1985 at U.
      S. Army hospitals, in which Thomas E. Wiswell, M. D., and
      colleagues found a decreased incidence of urinary tract
      infections in circumcised male infants, the AAP found
      possible methodological flaws. The Canadian Paediatric
      Society looked at the same research data and in December 1988
      reaffirmed its <a
      href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm">stand
      against routine circumcision</a>.</p>

      <p>Opponents of nonreligious circumcision were dismayed last
      year when the California Medical Association (CMA) by a voice
      vote, passed a resolution declaring circumcision to be an
      effective public health measure. Aaron Fink, M. D., a
      urologist, had submitted the resolution in 1987, but the
      CMA's scientific board was unable to find any scientific
      basis for claims that circumcision served to guard against
      venereal disease, herpes, and AIDS. In 1988, Dr. Fink's
      resolution was not sent to the scientific committee for
      review.</p>

      <p>James L. Snyder, M. D., a past president of the Virginia
      Urologic Society, expressed surprise at the CMA's adoption of
      the Fink resolution. Speaking on March 4, 1989, two days
      before the AAP released its statement, Dr. Snyder said, "Each
      of these diseases has a known etiologic agent, and as a
      physician in the United States Navy I have treated
      circumcised American servicemen for each of these conditions,
      using specific and effective antibiotics to cure what
      circumcision did not prevent.</p>

      <p align="center">Protection Claim 'Stretches Reason'</p>

      <p>As for "recent speculation" that routine circumcision
      could reduce urinary tract infections or "prevent infection
      due to the AIDS virus. "Dr. Snyder declares, that this
      stretches reason. More than 99% of male children have never
      had urinary tract infections regardless of the state of their
      foreskins. . . . [as for AIDS], American parents want to know
      why thousands of their children, brothers, and cousins in Los
      Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Miami were not protected
      from AIDS infection by the fact that 60-90% of them have been
      circumcised at birth since 1940.</p>

      <p>A resolution introduced by John W. Hardebeck, M. D., that
      the CMA resolution failed, however, "Newborn-male
      circumcision is a procedure without factual, demonstrable,
      supportable medical indications in the overwhelming majority
      of cases." From March 1 to 3, just before the CMA session,
      the First International Symposium on Circumcision convened at
      Anaheim. Among the speakers was Martin Altschul, M. D., a
      Salem, Ore. pediatrician who reviewed the pediatric case
      histories at six Kaiser Permanente hospitals in the Bay Area
      and found <a href="" target="_blank">no indication of
      increased urinary tract infections among uncircumcised male
      infants.</a></p>

      <p>Marilyn F. Milos, executive director of the National
      Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers (<a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org" target="_blank">NOCIRC</a>) of
      San Anselmo, Calif. organized the symposium. The speakers
      included Paul Fleiss, M. D., a Los Angeles pediatrician, who
      expressed concern about the unreported incidences of
      complications due to circumcision, including severe
      infection.</p>

      <p>Postprocedural infection was mentioned in a piece on
      circumcision aired March 27 on PBS's "MacNeil-Lehrer News
      Hour." Interviewed were Stephen and Valerie Creek of suburban
      Seattle whose son Daniel had been born in October. Two days
      after coming home from the hospital Daniel developed an "odd
      rash." Mrs. Creek took him to her pediatrician and was told,
      "Go to <a href="http://www.seattlechildrens.org/"
      target="_blank">Children's Hospital</a> immediately. Go to
      the emergency room," Said Mrs. Creek, "They told us that they
      didn't know if Daniel was going to survive, that he had this
      infection, it was real bad, and that he was very very sick."
      <a href="http://www.infocirc.org/fourn.htm"
      target="_blank">The week-old baby had to have extensive areas
      of skin and fat removed and spent time in a hyperbaric
      chamber before the infection disappeared.</a></p>

      <p>Asked what they would do if they had a second son, the
      Creeks were not sure they would have him circumcised. Said
      Mrs. Creek, "It's a tough decision. On the one hand I'd say
      yes . . . because the other boys are, and again . . . to see
      what he went though, if it doesn't have to be done . . . I
      would say no, don't do it."</p>

      <p>An expectant mother interviewed in the report said, "I can
      very easily see where the decision to circumcise is a weak
      one, but I think emotionally, inside, I feel it's the right
      decision to make. There are still cultural things we adhere
      to. You know I shave my legs. People in other countries don't
      do that. Why do I do it? Because that's what American women
      do.</p>

      <p>The Public Television reporter in Seattle found a Jewish
      physician who performed ritual circumcision and who said, "We
      don't strap [the baby] down. we put him on a loved one's lap.
      We give him some wine. We wait a little bit for it to take
      effect." But the doctor does not recommend surgery to parents
      who have no religious reason for doing it. (Muslims as well
      as Jews practice ritual circumcision.)</p>

      <p>A Seattle pediatrician David Springer, M. D., asked his
      rabbi to find a way to avoid having his son circumcised. Dr.
      Springer's first son had died of a heart problem, and he did
      not want to expose his son to unnecessary risk. "I saw no
      scientific reason for it. My own experience with circumcision
      was traumatic for my mother, and hence the trauma got
      projected onto me." But Dr. Springer and his wife wanted to
      enter their son into the covenant with God that circumcision
      symbolizes. Said Rabbi James Morrell, As a rabbi, I don't
      want to turn people away who on very legitimate grounds,
      decide not to circumcise their sons because of medical or
      psychological considerations." So the Springers and their
      rabbi worked out a substitute ceremony. "We gave him a Jewish
      name. We drew some blood - a normal newborn blood exam called
      the TKU. We did that as a celebration of his commitment to
      the Jewish people. We had our Jewish community there. The
      Rabbi composed a meaningful service for us that fit our
      particular situation, and I very happy with the decision.</p>

      <p align="center">`Small Price to Pay'</p>

      <p>Macneil-Lehrer interviewed Julian Ansul, M. D. a urologist
      in at the University of Washington, who accepts the validity
      of the Wiswell studies. "the brief period of discomfort that
      the child has and experiences, although real and not to be
      denied is worth the price of being sure that they don't have
      or much less likely to have urinary tract infections." said
      Dr. Ansul. "I think its a small price to pay for the fact
      that you will not face, or be very unlikely to face, the
      possibility of having cancer of the penis when you're in your
      40s and 50s and may die of that."</p>

      <p>Penile cancer is rare in the United States, observed
      Michael Rothenberg, M. D., coauthor with Benjamin Spock, M.
      D. of Baby and Child Care. Speaking on MacNeil-Lehrer, Dr.
      Rothenberg said "Its a horrible thing that's happening to
      parents in this country. Parents as a group have been made to
      feel horribly uncomfortable about this circumcision
      issue."</p>

      <p>A Swedish group, meanwhile, had suggested in the Lancet
      (March 18) that the prepuce or foreskin, was not "a mistake
      of nature" but perhaps presented a problem in societies.
      where childbirth was attended by good hygiene. Jan Winberg
      <i>et al.</i> accepted the Wiswell finding as "persuasive"
      and said, "IF they are correct, this will be the first known
      instance of a common, potentially lethal disease being
      preventable by extirpation of a piece of normal tissue."
      Trying to reconcile the prepuce "with existing views of
      evolution and biology, Winberg <i>et al.</i> suggest that "in
      biologically natural settings," mothers give birth in
      squatting or kneeling position and often defecate during
      delivery, thus colonizing the baby with their own aerobic and
      anaerobic intestinal flora.</p>

      <p>In sanitary hospital maternity units, on the other hand,
      the baby's gastrointestinal tract and genitals may be
      colonized by Echerichia coli strains "of non-maternal origin
      to which the baby has no passive immunity". Instead of
      circumcising newborns, said the Swedish pediatricians, "early
      infantile male UTI could be prevented by more natural
      colonization, either by more strict rooming in of the baby
      with his mother's anaerobic gut flora."</p>

      <p>About 58% of boys are still circumcised in the United
      States - far too many for opponents of the procedure. Said
      Ms. Milos of NOCIRC, "We now have 40% of American boys who
      are intact without problems. The grass-roots movement
      [against routine circumcision] is winning.</p>

      <p>"What's amazing to me [about the AAP statement] is that
      they work so hard to sit squarely on both sides of the fence
      on this issue. They've given the parents the responsibility
      to figure out what they (1) couldn't figure out or (2)
      couldn't take a stand on. The sad part is that babies will
      suffer because of the scare tactics of those who have a
      vested interest in perpetuating the practice."</p>
