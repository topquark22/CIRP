      <h5>"Routine circumcision of babies in the United States did
      not begin until the Cold War era. Circumcision is almost
      unheard of in Europe, Southern America, and non-Muslim Asia.
      In fact, only 10 to 15 percent of men throughout the world
      are circumcised."</h5>

      <h5>"The natural penis requires no special care. A child's
      foreskin, like his eyelids, is self-cleansing. Forcibly
      retracting a baby's foreskin can lead to irritation and
      infection. The best way to care for a child's intact penis is
      to leave it alone."</h5>

      <h3>The Foreskin Is Necessary</h3>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Western countries have no
      tradition of circumcision. In antiquity, the expansion of the
      Greek and Roman Empires brought Westerners into contact with
      the peoples of the Middle East, some of whom marked their
      children with circumcision and other sexual mutilations. To
      protect these children, the Greeks and Romans passed laws
      forbidding circumcision.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Over
      the centuries, the Catholic Church has passed many similar
      laws.<sup><a href="#n2">2,3</a></sup> The traditional Western
      response to circumcision has been revulsion and
      indignation.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Circumcision started in
      America during the masturbation hysteria of the Victorian
      Era, when a few American doctors circumcised boys to punish
      them for masturbating. Victorian doctors knew very well that
      circumcision denudes, desensitizes, and disables the penis.
      Nevertheless, they were soon claiming that circumcision cured
      epilepsy, convulsions, paralysis, elephantiasis,
      tuberculosis, eczema, bed-wetting, hip-joint disease, fecal
      incontinence, rectal prolapse, wet dreams, hernia, headaches,
      nervousness, hysteria, poor eyesight, idiocy, mental
      retardation, and insanity.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, no procedure in
      the history of medicine has been claimed to cure and prevent
      more diseases than circumcision. As late as the 1970s,
      leading American medical textbooks still advocated routine
      circumcision as a way to prevent masturbation.<sup><a
      href="#n5">5</a></sup> The antisexual motivations behind an
      operation that entails cutting off part of the penis are
      obvious.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The radical practice of
      routinely circumcising babies did not begin until the Cold
      War era. This institutionalization of what amounted to
      compulsory circumcision was part of the same movement that
      pathologized and medicalized birth and actively discouraged
      breastfeeding. Private-sector, corporate-run hospitals
      institutionalized routine circumcision without ever
      consulting the American people. There was no public debate or
      referendum. It was only in the 1970s that a series of
      lawsuits forced hospitals to obtain parental consent to
      perform this contraindicated but highly profitable surgery.
      Circumcisers responded by inventing new "medical" reasons for
      circumcision in an attempt to scare parents into
      consenting.</p>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Today the reasons given for
      circumcision have been updated to play on contemporary fears
      and anxieties; but one day they, too, will be considered
      irrational. Now that such current excuses as the claim that
      this procedure prevents cancer and sexually transmitted
      diseases have been thoroughly discredited, circumcisers will
      undoubtedly invent new ones. But if circumcisers were really
      motivated by purely medical considerations, the procedure
      would have died out long ago, along with leeching,
      skull-drilling, and castration. The fact that it has not
      suggests that the compulsion to circumcise came first, the
      "reasons," later.</p>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Millions of years of
      evolution have fashioned the human body into a model of
      refinement, elegance, and efficiency, with every part having
      a function and purpose. Evolution has determined that
      mammals' genitals should be sheathed in a protective,
      responsive, multipurpose foreskin. Every normal human being
      is born with a foreskin. In females, it protects the glans of
      the clitoris; in males, it protects the glans of the penis.
      Thus, the foreskin is an essential part of human sexual
      anatomy.</p>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Parents should enjoy the
      arrival of a new child with as few worries as possible. The
      birth of a son in the US, however, is often fraught with
      anxiety and confusion. Most parents are pressured to hand
      their baby sons over to a stranger, who, behind closed doors,
      straps babies down and cuts their foreskins off. The
      billion-dollar-a-year circumcision industry has bombarded
      Americans with confusing rhetoric and calculated scare
      tactics.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Information about the
      foreskin itself is almost always missing from discussions
      about circumcision. The mass circumcision campaigns of the
      past few decades have resulted in pandemic ignorance about
      this remarkable structure and its versatile role in human
      sexuality. Ignorance and false information about the foreskin
      are the rule in American medical literature, education, and
      practice. Most American medical textbooks depict the human
      penis, without explanation, as circumcised, as if it were so
      by nature.</p>

      <h3>What Is the Foreskin?</h3>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The foreskin is a uniquely
      specialized, sensitive, functional organ of touch. No other
      part of the body serves the same purpose. As a modified
      extension of the penile shaft skin, the foreskin covers and
      usually extends beyond the glans before folding under itself
      and finding its circumferential point of attachment just
      behind the corona (the rim of the glans). The foreskin is,
      therefore, a double-layered organ. Its true length is twice
      the length of its external fold and comprises as much as 80
      percent or more of the penile skin covering.<sup><a
      href="#n6">6,7</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The foreskin contains a
      rich concentration of blood vessels and nerve endings. It is
      lined with the peripenic muscle sheet, a smooth muscle layer
      with longitudinal fibers. These muscle fibers are whirled,
      forming a kind of sphincter that ensures optimum protection
      of the urinary tract from contaminants of all kinds.</p>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Like the undersurface of the
      eyelids or the inside of the cheek, the undersurface of the
      foreskin consists of mucous membrane. It is divided into two
      distinct zones: the soft mucosa and the ridged mucosa. The
      soft mucosa lies against the glans penis and contains ectopic
      sebaceous glands that secrete emollients, lubricants, and
      protective antibodies. Similar glands are found in the
      eyelids and mouth.</p>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Adjacent to the soft mucosa and
      just behind the lips of the foreskin is the ridged mucosa.
      This exquisitely sensitive structure consists of tightly
      pleated concentric bands, like the elastic bands at the top
      of a sock. These expandable pleats allow the foreskin lips to
      open and roll back, exposing the glans. The ridged mucosa
      gives the foreskin its characteristic taper.</p>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; On the underside of the glans,
      the foreskin's point of attachment is advanced toward the
      meatus (urethral opening) and forms a bandlike ligament
      called the frenulum. It is identical to the frenulum that
      secures the tongue to the floor of the mouth. The foreskin's
      frenulum holds it in place over the glans, and, in
      conjunction with the smooth muscle fibers, helps return the
      retracted foreskin to its usual forward position over the
      glans.</p>

      <h3>Retraction of the Foreskin</h3>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; At birth, the foreskin is
      usually attached to the glans, very much as a fingernail is
      attached to a finger. By puberty, the penis will usually have
      completed its development, and the foreskin will have
      separated from the glans.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> This
      separation occurs in its own time; there is no set age by
      which the foreskin and glans must be separated. One wise
      doctor described the process thus, "The foreskin therefore
      can be likened to a rosebud which remains closed and muzzled.
      Like a rosebud, it will only blossom when the time is right.
      No one opens a rosebud to make it blossom."<sup><a
      href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Even if the glans and foreskin
      separate naturally in infancy, the foreskin lips can normally
      dilate only enough to allow the passage of urine. This ideal
      feature protects the glans from premature exposure to the
      external environment.</p>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The penis develops naturally
      throughout childhood. Eventually, the child will, on his own,
      make the wondrous discovery that his foreskin will retract.
      There is no reason for parents, physicians, or other
      caregivers to manipulate a child's penis. The only person to
      retract a child's foreskin should be the child himself, when
      he has discovered that his foreskin is ready to retract.</p>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Parents should be wary of
      anyone who tries to retract their child's foreskin, and
      especially wary of anyone who wants to cut it off. Human
      foreskins are in great demand for any number of commercial
      enterprises, and the marketing of purloined baby foreskins is
      a multimillion-dollar-a-year industry. Pharmaceutical and
      cosmetic companies use human foreskins as research material.
      Corporations such as Advanced Tissue Sciences, Organogenesis,
      and BioSurface Technology use human foreskins as the raw
      materials for a type of breathable bandage.<sup><a
      href="#n10">10</a></sup></p>

      <h3>What Are the Foreskin's Functions?</h3>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The foreskin has numerous
      protective, sensory, and sexual functions.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Protection</b>: Just as the eyelids protect the
        eyes, the foreskin protects the glans and keeps its surface
        soft, moist, and sensitive. It also maintains optimal
        warmth, pH balance, and cleanliness. The glans itself
        contains no sebaceous glands-glands that produce the sebum,
        or oil, that moisturizes our skin.<sup><a
        href="#n11">11</a></sup> The foreskin produces the sebum
        that maintains proper health of the surface of the
        glans.</li>

        <li><b>Immunological Defense</b>: The mucous membranes that
        line all body orifices are the body's first line of
        immunological defense. Glands in the foreskin produce
        antibacterial and antiviral proteins such as
        lysozyme.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> Lysozyme is also
        found in tears and mother's milk. Specialized epithelial
        Langerhans cells, an immune system component, abound in the
        foreskin's outer surface.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup>
        Plasma cells in the foreskin's mucosal lining secrete
        immunoglobulins, antibodies that defend against
        infection.<sup><a href="#n14">14</a></sup></li>

        <li><b>Erogenous Sensitivity</b>: The foreskin is as
        sensitive as the fingertips or the lips of the mouth. It
        contains a richer variety and greater concentration of
        specialized nerve receptors than any other part of the
        penis.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> These specialized
        nerve endings can discern motion, subtle changes in
        temperature, and fine gradations of texture.<sup><a
        href="#n16">16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23</a></sup></li>

        <li><b>Coverage During Erection</b>: As it becomes erect,
        the penile shaft becomes thicker and longer. The
        double-layered foreskin provides the skin necessary to
        accommodate the expanded organ and to allow the penile skin
        to glide freely, smoothly, and pleasurably over the shaft
        and glans.</li>

        <li><b>Self-Stimulating Sexual Functions</b>: The
        foreskin's double-layered sheath enables the penile shaft
        skin to glide back and forth over the penile shaft. The
        foreskin can normally be slipped all the way, or almost all
        the way, back to the base of the penis, and also slipped
        forward beyond the glans. This wide range of motion is the
        mechanism by which the penis and the orgasmic triggers in
        the foreskin, frenulum, and glans are stimulated.</li>

        <li><b>Sexual Functions in Intercourse</b>: One of the
        foreskin's functions is to facilitate smooth, gentle
        movement between the mucosal surfaces of the two partners
        during intercourse. The foreskin enables the penis to slip
        in and out of the vagina nonabrasively inside its own slick
        sheath of self-lubricating, movable skin. The female is
        thus stimulated by moving pressure rather than by friction
        only, as when the male's foreskin is missing.</li>

        <li><b>The foreskin fosters intimacy between the two
        partners by enveloping the glans and maintaining it as an
        internal organ.</b> The sexual experience is enhanced when
        the foreskin slips back to allow the male's internal organ,
        the glans, to meet the female's internal organ, the
        cervix-a moment of supreme intimacy and beauty.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The foreskin may have functions
        not yet recognized or understood. Scientists in Europe
        recently detected estrogen receptors in its basal epidermal
        cells.<sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup> Researchers at the
        University of Manchester found that the human foreskin has
        apocrine glands.<sup><a href="#n25">25</a></sup> These
        specialized glands produce pheromones, nature's chemical
        messengers. Further studies are needed to fully understand
        these features of the foreskin and the role they play.
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Care of the Foreskin</h3>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The natural penis requires no
      special care. A child's foreskin, like his eyelids, is
      self-cleansing. For the same reason it is inadvisable to lift
      the eyelids and wash the eyeballs, it is inadvisable to
      retract a child's foreskin and wash the glans. Immersion in
      plain water during the bath is all that is needed to keep the
      intact penis clean.<sup><a href="#n26">26</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The white emollient under the
      child's foreskin is called smegma. Smegma is probably the
      most misunderstood, most unjustifiably maligned substance in
      nature. Smegma is clean, not dirty, and is beneficial and
      necessary. It moisturizes the glans and keeps it smooth,
      soft, and supple. Its antibacterial and antiviral properties
      keep the penis clean and healthy. All mammals produce smegma.
      Thomas J. Ritter, MD, underscored its importance when he
      commented, "The animal kingdom would probably cease to exist
      without smegma."<sup><a href="#n27">27</a></sup></p>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Studies suggest that it is best
      not to use soap on the glans or foreskin's inner fold.<sup><a
      href="#n28">28</a></sup> Forcibly retracting and washing a
      baby's foreskin destroys the beneficial bacterial flora that
      protect the penis from harmful germs and can lead to
      irritation and infection. The best way to care for a child's
      intact penis is to leave it alone. After puberty, males can
      gently rinse their glans and foreskin with warm water,
      according to their own self-determined needs.</p>

      <h3>How Common Is Circumcision?</h3>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Circumcision is almost unheard
      of in Europe, South America, and non-Muslim Asia. In fact,
      only 10 to 15 percent of men throughout the world are
      circumcised, the vast majority of whom are Muslim.<sup><a
      href="#n29">29</a></sup> The neonatal circumcision rate in
      the western US has now fallen to 34.2 percent.<sup><a
      href="#n30">30</a></sup> This relatively diminished rate may
      surprise American men born during the era when nearly 90
      percent of baby boys were circumcised automatically, with or
      without their parents' consent.</p>

      <h3>How Does Circumcision Harm?</h3>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The "medical" debate about the
      "potential health benefits" of circumcision rarely addresses
      its real effects.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Circumcision denudes</b>: Depending on the amount of
        skin cut off, circumcision robs a male of as much as 80
        percent or more of his penile skin. Depending on the
        foreskin's length, cutting it off makes the penis as much
        as 25 percent or more shorter. Careful anatomical
        investigations have shown that circumcision cuts off more
        than 3 feet of veins, arteries, and capillaries, 240 feet
        of nerves, and more than 20,000 nerve endings.<sup><a
        href="#n31">31</a></sup> The foreskin's muscles, glands,
        mucous membrane, and epithelial tissue are destroyed, as
        well.</li>

        <li><b>Circumcision desensitizes</b>: Circumcision
        desensitizes the penis radically. Foreskin amputation means
        severing the rich nerve network and all the nerve receptors
        in the foreskin itself. Circumcision almost always damages
        or destroys the frenulum. The loss of the protective
        foreskin desensitizes the glans. Because the membrane
        covering the permanently externalized glans is now
        subjected to constant abrasion and irritation, it
        keratinizes, becoming dry and tough. The nerve endings in
        the glans, which in the intact penis are just beneath the
        surface of the mucous membrane, are now buried by
        successive layers of keratinization. The denuded glans
        takes on a dull, grayish, sclerotic appearance.</li>

        <li><b>Circumcision disables</b>: The amputation of so much
        penile skin permanently immobilizes whatever skin remains,
        preventing it from gliding freely over the shaft and glans.
        This loss of mobility destroys the mechanism by which the
        glans is normally stimulated. When the circumcised penis
        becomes erect, the immobilized remaining skin is stretched,
        sometimes so tightly that not enough skin is left to cover
        the erect shaft. Hair-bearing skin from the groin and
        scrotum is often pulled onto the shaft, where hair is not
        normally found. The surgically externalized mucous membrane
        of the glans has no sebaceous glands. Without the
        protection and emollients of the foreskin, it dries out,
        making it susceptible to cracking and bleeding.</li>

        <li><b>Circumcision disfigures</b>: Circumcision alters the
        appearance of the penis drastically. It permanently
        externalizes the glans, normally an internal organ.
        Circumcision leaves a large circumferential surgical scar
        on the penile shaft. Because circumcision usually
        necessitates tearing the foreskin from the glans, pieces of
        the glans may be torn off, too, leaving it pitted and
        scarred. Shreds of foreskin may adhere to the raw glans,
        forming tags and bridges of dangling, displaced
        skin.<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup></li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Depending on the amount of
        skin cut off and how the scar forms, the circumcised penis
        may be permanently twisted, or curve or bow during
        erection.<sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup> The contraction
        of the scar tissue may pull the shaft into the abdomen, in
        effect shortening the penis or burying it
        completely.<sup><a href="#n34">34</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Circumcision disrupts circulation</b>: Circumcision
        interrupts the normal circulation of blood throughout the
        penile skin system and glans. The blood flowing into major
        penile arteries is obstructed by the line of scar tissue at
        the point of incision, creating backflow instead of feeding
        the branches and capillary networks beyond the scar.
        Deprived of blood, the meatus may contract and scarify,
        obstructing the flow of urine.<sup><a
        href="#n35">35</a></sup> This condition, known as meatal
        stenosis, often requires corrective surgery. Meatal
        stenosis is found almost exclusively among boys who have
        been circumcised.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Circumcision also severs the
        lymph vessels, interrupting the circulation of lymph and
        sometimes causing lymphedema, a painful, disfiguring
        condition in which the remaining skin of the penis swells
        with trapped lymph fluid.

      <ul>
        <li><b>Circumcision harms the developing brain</b>: Recent
        studies published in leading medical journals have reported
        that circumcision has long-lasting detrimental effects on
        the developing brain,<sup><a href="#n36">36</a></sup>
        adversely altering the brain's perception centers.
        Circumcised boys have a lower pain threshold than girls or
        intact boys.<sup><a href="#n37">37</a></sup> Developmental
        neuropsychologist Dr. James Prescott suggests that
        circumcision can cause deeper and more disturbing levels of
        neurological damage, as well.<sup><a href="#n38">38,

        <li><b>Circumcision is unhygienic and unhealthy</b>: One of
        the most common myths about circumcision is that it makes
        the penis cleaner and easier to take care of. This is not
        true. Eyes without eyelids would not be cleaner; neither
        would a penis without its foreskin. The artificially
        externalized glans and meatus of the circumcised penis are
        constantly exposed to abrasion and dirt, making the
        circumcised penis, in fact, more unclean. The loss of the
        protective foreskin leaves the urinary tract vulnerable to
        invasion by bacterial and viral pathogens.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The circumcision wound is larger
        than most people imagine. It is not just the circular point
        of union between the outer and inner layers of the
        remaining skin. Before a baby is circumcised, his foreskin
        must be torn from his glans, literally skinning it alive.
        This creates a large open area of raw, bleeding flesh,
        covered at best with a layer of undeveloped proto-mucosa.
        Germs can easily enter the damaged tissue and bloodstream
        through the raw glans and, even more easily, through the
        incision itself. 

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Even after the wound has
        healed, the externalized glans and meatus are still forced
        into constant unnatural contact with urine, feces,
        chemically treated diapers, and other contaminants.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Female partners of
        circumcised men do not report a lower rate of cervical
        cancer,<sup><a href="#n40">40</a></sup> nor does
        circumcision prevent penile cancer.<sup><a
        href="#n41">41</a></sup> A recent study shows that the
        penile cancer rate is higher in the US than in Denmark,
        where circumcision, except among Middle-Eastern immigrant
        workers, is almost unheard of.<sup><a
        href="#n42">42</a></sup> Indeed, researchers should
        investigate the possibility that circumcision has actually
        increased the rate of these diseases.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Circumcision does not prevent
        acquisition or transmission of sexually transmitted
        diseases (STDs). In fact, the US has both the highest
        percentage of sexually active circumcised males in the
        Western world and the highest rates of sexually transmitted
        diseases, including AIDS. Rigorously controlled prospective
        studies show that circumcised American men are at a greater
        risk for bacterial and viral STDs, especially
        gonorrhea,<sup><a href="#n43">43</a></sup> nongonoccal
        urethritis,<sup><a href="#n44">44</a></sup> human papilloma
        virus,<sup><a href="#n45">45</a></sup> herpes simplex virus
        type 2,<sup><a href="#n46">46</a></sup> and
        chlamydia.<sup><a href="#n47">47</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Circumcision is always risky</b>: Circumcision
        always carries the risk of serious, even tragic,
        consequences. Its surgical complication rate is one in
        500.<sup><a href="#n48">48</a></sup> These complications
        include uncontrollable bleeding and fatal
        infections.<sup><a href="#n49">49</a></sup> There are many
        published case reports of gangrene following
        circumcision.<sup><a href="#n50">50</a></sup> Pathogenic
        bacteria such as staphylococcus, Proteus, Pseudomonas,
        other coliforms, and even tuberculosis can cause infections
        leading to death.<sup><a href="#n51">51, 52</a></sup> These
        organisms enter the wound because it provides easy entry,
        not because the child is predisposed to infection.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Medical journals have
        published numerous accounts of babies who have had part or
        all of their glans cut off while they were being
        circumcised.<sup><a href="#n53">53,54,55</a></sup> Other
        fully conscious, unanesthetized babies have had their
        entire penis burned off with an electrocautery gun.<sup><a
        href="#n56">56,57, 58</a></sup> The September 1989
        <i>Journal of Urology</i> published an account of four such
        cases.<sup><a href="#n59">59</a></sup> The article
        described the sex-change operation as "feminizing
        genitoplasty," performed on these babies in an attempt to
        change them into girls. The March 1997 <i><a
        href="http://www.augsburg.edu/psych/psy355/no_penis.html">Archives
        of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine</a></i> described one
        young person's horror on learning that "she" had been born
        a normal male, but that a circumciser had burned his penis
        off when he was a baby.<sup><a href="#n60">60</a></sup>
        Many other similar cases have been documented.<sup><a
        href="#n61">61,62</a></sup> Infant circumcision has a
        reported death rate of one in 500,000.<sup><a
        href="#n63">63,64</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Circumcision harms mothers</b>: Scientific studies
        have consistently shown that circumcision disrupts a
        child's behavioral development. Studies performed at the
        University of Colorado School of Medicine showed that
        circumcision is followed by prolonged, unrestful non-REM
        (rapid-eye-movement) sleep.<sup><a href="#n64">65</a></sup>
        In response to the lengthy bombardment of their neural
        pathways with unbearable pain, the circumcised babies
        withdrew into a kind of semicoma that lasted days or even
        weeks.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Numerous other studies have
        proven that circumcision disrupts the mother-infant bond
        during the crucial period after birth. Research has also
        shown that circumcision disrupts feeding patterns. In a
        study at the Washington University School of Medicine, most
        babies would not nurse right after they were circumcised,
        and those who did would not look into their mothers'
        eyes.<sup><a href="#n66">66</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Circumcision violates patients' and human
        rights</b>: No one has the right to cut off any part of
        someone else's genitals without that person's competent,
        fully informed consent. Since it is the infant who must
        bear the consequences, circumcision violates his legal
        rights both to refuse treatment and to seek alternative
        treatment. In 1995, the American Academy of Pediatrics
        Committee on Bioethics stated that only a competent patient
        can give patient consent or informed consent.<sup><a
        href="#n67">67</a></sup> An infant is obviously too young to
        consent to anything. He must be protected from anyone who
        would take advantage of his defenselessness. The concept of
        informed parental permission allows for medical
        interventions in situations of clear and immediate medical
        necessity only, such as disease, trauma, or deformity. The
        human penis in its normal, uncircumcised state satisfies
        none of these requirements.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Physicians have a duty to refuse
        to perform circumcision. They also must educate parents
        who, out of ignorance or misguidance, request this surgery
        for their sons. The healthcare professional's obligation is
        to protect the interests of the child. It is unethical in
        the extreme to force upon a child an amputation he almost
        certainly would never have chosen for himself.
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Common Sense</h3>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; To be intact, as nature
      intended, is best. The vast majority of males who are given
      the choice value their wholeness and keep their foreskins,
      for the same reason they keep their other organs of
      perception. Parents in Europe and non-Muslim Asia never have
      forced their boys to be circumcised. It would no more occur
      to them to cut off part of their boys' penises than it would
      to cut off part of their ears. Respecting a child's right to
      keep his genitals intact is normal and natural. It is
      conservative in the best sense of the word.</p>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A circumcised father who has
      mixed feelings about his intact newborn son may require
      gentle, compassionate psychological counseling to help him
      come to terms with his loss and to overcome his anxieties
      about normal male genitalia. In such cases, the mother should
      steadfastly protect her child, inviting her husband to share
      this protective role and helping him diffuse his negative
      feelings. Most parents want what is best for their baby. Wise
      parents listen to their hearts and trust their instinct to
      protect their baby from harm. The experience of the ages has
      shown that babies thrive best in a trusting atmosphere of
      love, gentleness, respect, acceptance, nurturing, and
      intimacy. Cutting off a baby's foreskin shatters this trust.
      Circumcision wounds and harms the baby and the person the
      baby will become. Parents who respect their son's wholeness
      are bequeathing to him his birthright-his body, perfect and
      beautiful in its entirety.</p>
