            <p><b>Jackie Smith</b><br />
             National Post</p>

            <p><i>Friday, August 30, 2002</i></p>

            <p>Just 30 years ago, male circumcision was all the
            rage; as many as 90% of boys in the United States, 70%
            of those in Australia, 48% in Canada and 24% in the
            United Kingdom were circumcised (often without any
            anesthesia).</p>

            <p>I remember the war that waged in my own mind when my
            son was born in the 1980s.</p>

            <p>I had no religious reasons for choosing
            circumcision; I wasn't trying to guard against
            "unhealthy masturbation," as early proponents of
            circumcision were. I didn't care if he looked like dad,
            as some parents do. I wanted to know only one thing:
            What would be best for him -- medically.</p>

            <p>If he wasn't circumcised, would I be responsible for
            increasing his chances of urinary tract infections and
            sexually transmitted disease, as some physicians had
            suggested? Would it mean he might need the operation
            later in life, when circumcision is more uncomfortable,
            not to mention unpleasant?</p>

            <p>What if he had the operation and got an infection?
            What if the knife slipped? How would I live with
            myself?</p>

            <p>More important, how would he live with himself?</p>

            <p>It's the nature of parenting to always think, "What
            could I have done better?" So once I made a decision I
            worried over whether it was the right one. Like all
            parents, I tried to act in the best interests of my
            child.</p>

            <p>When the <a href="http://www.cps.ca/"
            target="_blank">Canadian Pediatric Society</a> (CPS)
            reviewed the medical literature and came out against
            routine circumcision in <a
            href="http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm"
            target="_blank">1996</a>, I thought the matter was
            settled. The CPS looked at the effects of newborn
            circumcision on the rate of urinary tract infections,
            sexually transmitted diseases, cancer of the penis,
            penile problems, and decided the practice was
            inadvisable. This was in line with a <a
            href="/library/statements/cps1975/">recommendation made
            earlier</a> by its Fetus and Newborn Committee and with
            <a href="/library/statements/aap/#1971">1971</a> and <a
            href="/library/statements/aap/#1975">1975</a>
            recommendations of the American Academy of
            Pediatrics.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, debates about the ethics of
            circumcision remain unresolved because of its
            connection to religion and culture -- because medical
            studies sometimes turn up different results, and
            because parents do think their kids should look like
            dad.</p>

            <p>Still, I believe a consensus against circumcision is
            steadily emerging. In this new era of patient rights,
            circumcision has come to seem like an anachronism.
            Among doctors, there is a greater emphasis on informed
            decision-making, the limits on parents' rights to make
            decisions about their kids' health and the rights of
            children to be protected from parents who make wrong
            decisions. Even some adult men who were unnecessarily
            circumcised as children are asserting their rights to
            restitution. And since the balance of medical evidence
            suggests those who oppose circumcision have the facts
            on their side, doctors are increasingly refusing to
            perform circumcisions. Complications from bleeding,
            amputation, renal failure, sepsis and death are
            powerful incentives to stop.</p>

            <p>With the death of an infant in B.C., possibly as a
            result of circumcision and currently under coroner's
            investigation, there will be more questions of
            circumcision's benefits and risks -- with a more
            pronounced focus on the latter.</p>

            <p>Parents who opt for circumcision must, as a matter
            of both law and morals, make their decision based on
            the principle of respect for the rights and best
            interests of their child, according to the available
            information concerning risks and benefits. The <a
            href="/news/theprovince08-29-02/">death of the Kamloops
            baby</a> may bring new awareness about the risks of
            circumcision (though the baby's death may ultimately
            turn out to have arisen from something far more
            complicated than a botched circumcision).</p>

            <p>Indeed, the media coverage of the incident may speed
            circumcision for non-religious reasons into the dustbin
            of medical practice -- alongside many other
            once-popular procedures, such as the removal of the
            ovaries for hysteria, tonsillectomy for a sore throat,
            lobotomy for mental retardation, etc. In a few years,
            looking like dad or wanting to keep a boy "clean" may
            no longer be legally legitimate rationales for
            circumcision. It's about time they weren't. Parents who
            have had their kids circumcised can't be faulted for
            doing what they thought was right. <span>But it is
            unethical to continue a practice that is no longer
            medically defensible and could harm our
            kids.</span></p>
