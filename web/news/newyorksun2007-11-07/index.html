            <h2>Ore. Court Mulls Circumcision Case</h2>
            By JOSH GERSTEIN<br />
             Staff Reporter of the Sun November 7, 2007 

            <p>SALEM, Ore. &mdash; Six justices of the <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/index.htm"
             target="_blank">Oregon Supreme Court</a> are wrestling
            with the question of what to do when divorced parents
            disagree about whether a child should be
            circumcised.<br />
            <br />
             For an hour yesterday, the judges heard arguments in a
            child custody dispute between <a
            href="http://www.familylawattorney1.com/"
            target="_blank">James Boldt</a>, who wants his son
            circumcised as part of the son's conversion to Judaism,
            and the child's mother, Lia Boldt, who went to court to
            block the procedure. The child, who was 9 at the time
            the issue arose in 2004, is now 12.<br />
            <br />
             A county judge dismissed Mrs. Boldt's challenge, but
            blocked the circumcision from taking place until all
            appeals were exhausted. The mother's attorney, <a
            href="http://www.claypatrick.com/"
            target="_blank">Clayton Patrick</a>, told the court
            that the circumcision posed "an unreasonable and
            unnecessarily high risk to the child." Mr. Patrick was
            quickly challenged by <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/gillettebio.htm"
             target="_blank">Judge W. Michael Gillette</a>, who
            asked whether courts should step in when a divorced
            couple disagrees about whether a child should play
            football.<br />
            <br />
             "More people get hurt playing football than from
            having a circumcision and a lot more seriously," Judge
            Gillette said. He said family court disputes over going
            out for football were a "necessary consequence" of the
            mother's position. "That's preposterous. I hope you
            recognize that cannot work," the judge said. Mr.
            Patrick said that, even though the father had full
            custody of the child, the mother was entitled to a
            court hearing because, based on her review of
            information about circumcision, the practice amounts to
            "sex abuse or physical abuse."<br />
            <br />
             "If the custodial parent wanted to amputate some other
            body part, I think the court would step in and say you
            can't do that," the attorney said. Mr. Boldt, other
            family members and the doctor who would perform the
            circumcision said the boy wanted it. However, Mrs.
            Boldt said her son told her that he did not want to be
            circumcised and was afraid to contradict his father.
            Some of the justices asked whether the courts should
            take the child's views into account, either when he was
            9 or at age 12.<br />
            <br />
             "The child's wishes, while of course they should be
            considered, are not legally decisive or, legally
            speaking, relevant," Mr. Boldt, who is a lawyer and has
            represented himself in the legal proceedings, said.
            Judges speculated about whether custodial parents had
            the right to impose genital mutilation or a nose job
            "on children whose faces are just fine." "Are there no
            limits?" one judge asked.<br />
            <br />
             When Mr. Boldt said he thought a custodial parent
            could do anything that wasn't illegal to a child, <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/kistlerbio.htm"
             target="_blank">Judge Rives Kistler</a> replied, "That
            seems a real broad claim. What if they wanted to have
            tattoos put on the child's face?"<br />
            <br />
             Mr. Boldt said some actions might be so outrageous
            that they called into question a person's fitness as a
            parent. A tattoo on a child's shoulder that says "Mom"
            would be a different matter than "a swastika on the
            forehead," he said.<br />
            <br />
             Mr. Boldt insisted that the court should not single
            out circumcision for greater scrutiny than other
            parenting choices. "There's no principled,
            intellectually defensible, legally supportable reason
            to extract that one category," he said. Much of the
            hearing discussed whether Mrs. Boldt was automatically
            entitled to a formal evidentiary hearing on her
            objection and, if not, what evidence she had to produce
            to get such a hearing.<br />
            <br />
             The Oregon jurists appear to be the highest-ranking
            American court to hear a dispute involving
            circumcision, according to a New York University law
            professor who has <a href="/library/legal/miller1/"
            target="_blank">written on the issue</a>, Geoffrey
            Miller. "It will be a precedent that will be closely
            paid attention to by people who are interested in that
            debate," the professor said. "I would be quite shocked
            or at least surprised if the result in the <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/index.htm"
             target="_blank">Oregon Supreme Court</a> undoes what
            the lower courts said."<br />
            <br />
             A Portland rabbi who attended the argument, Daniel
            Isaak, said he was surprised that there was little
            discussion of the religious freedom aspect of the case.
            "Circumcision is a basic rite of conversion" for Jewish
            men and is also practiced by Muslims, the rabbi
            said.<br />
            <br />
             Four Jewish groups, the <a
            href="http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer"
            target="_blank">American Jewish Congress</a>, the <a
            href="http://www.ajc.org/" target="_blank">American
            Jewish Committee</a>, the <a href="http://www.adl.org/"
            target="_blank">Anti-Defamation League</a>, and the <a
            href="http://www.ou.org/" target="_blank">Orthodox
            Union</a>, filed an amicus brief backing Mr. Boldt. A
            physicians' group, <a
            href="http://wwww.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>,
            filed a brief supporting Mrs. Boldt.<br />
            <br />
             The anti-circumcision <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/pdf/2007-07BoldtMerits.pdf"
             target="_blank">brief</a> notes that during a prior
            court proceeding unrelated to the circumcision issue,
            the Boldts agreed that they had a dominant-submissive
            relationship &mdash; in which Mr. Boldt was "god" or
            "sovereign" &mdash; and that sometimes involved Mr.
            Boldt administering beatings to his wife, who assumed
            the role of "slave girl." The Boldts' son "must not be
            abandoned by the courts, to become embroiled in his
            father's need for a replacement slave &hellip; if that
            is what happened," the anti-circumcision group
            argued.<br />
            <br />
             Mr. Boldt declined to be interviewed as he left court
            yesterday. The groups defending circumcision stated in
            their brief that they were taking no position on "who
            is the more appropriate parent."</p>
