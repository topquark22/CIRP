            <p>Modimolle - The number of initiates who have died
            following circumcision rituals in Limpopo rose to four
            on Thursday when a 17-year-old boy died after
            complaining of severe pain.</p>

            <p>Bushveld area police spokesperson Inspector Abbey
            Makgakge said the teenager died at an initiation school
            in Phahameng township near Modimolle, formerly
            Nylstroom, around 03:30.</p>

            <p>"An initiate sleeping next to him was woken up by
            his groaning and called the seniors, but he died before
            they could ask for help," Makgakge said.</p>

            <p>Makgakge was unable to say whether the school was
            registered with the provincial government as required
            by the Initiation Schools Regulations Act. "We're still
            investigating [the status of the school] but don't
            suspect any foul play," he said.</p>

            <p>Spokesperson for the MEC in the office of the
            premier Catherine Mabuza, Lucky Nchabeleng, was also
            unable to say whether the school was registered.</p>

            <p>Two initiates have died at school this winter, while
            two others died shortly after graduating.</p>

            <p>Mazka Kgatla (19), died from blood loss on June 21
            after being circumcised at Mokgolobotho near
            Tzaneen.</p>

            <p>Two more - Moloko Setlabane (13), of Sekgosese near
            Giyani and Johannes Letsoalo (21) of Komaneng Village
            near Polokwane - died during graduation ceremonies
            three weeks ago.</p>

            <p>MEC Mabuza shut down 17 unregistered initiation
            schools in July and <a
            href="/news/africaneye07-03-02/">630 initiates were
            taken to hospitals and clinics suffering from
            infections and shock</a>.</p>

            <p>The closed schools didn't comply with the act's
            stipulation that they should be linked to a nearby
            clinic or hospital.</p>

            <p>Limpopo police are yet to make an arrest following
            the illegal operation of the some schools.</p>

            <p>Dockets have been sent to the director of public
            prosecutions to decide whether to prosecute the cases.
