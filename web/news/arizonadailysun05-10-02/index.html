      <h1>House uses prisoner releases, school cuts to help balance
      budget</h1>
      <p>By HOWARD FISCHER<br /> <i>Capitol Media Services</i><br />05/10/2002</p> 

      <p>PHOENIX -- State lawmakers voted Thursday to release
      prisoners and let them serve their sentences at home, lease
      new school buildings instead of buying them for cash, cut $90
      million earmarked for school repairs and even <span>stop
      having the state pay for circumcision of boys</span> born to
      needy women, all to balance next year's $6.57 billion
      budget.</p>

      <p>The plan adopted by the House also cuts 3.125 percent from
      most state agencies -- 2.25 percent for universities -- on
      top of the 4.5 percent budget reductions they already
      sustained to balance this year's budget.</p>

      <p>Other noted elements include: Abolishing the State Board
      of Community Colleges; Deferring more than $190 million in
      payments due to schools in June 2003 until the following
      fiscal year; Requiring Pima and Maricopa counties to house
      prisoners sentenced to less than a year without being
      reimbursed by the state; Taking $50 million from the state's
      "rainy day" fund.</p>

      <p>The plan is drawing fire from Gov. Jane Hull -- especially
      the idea of forcing the Department of Corrections to release
      inmates from prisons.</p>

      <p>"This budgetary item puts the department in the position
      of having to let bad guys out of jail before they finish
      their sentences," said gubernatorial press aide Francie
      Noyes. "That threatens public safety."</p>

      <p>The plan sets an absolute cap on the number of inmates it
      could have incarcerated. That would be the number of
      available prison beds plus another 2,850 inmates.</p>

      <p>That higher figure is because the state has exceeded its
      "official" bed capacity for years, using other rooms to house
      inmates. The state already is close to the figure in the
      legislation: The most recent published figures show 2,844
      inmates above capacity.</p>

      <p>And when that limit is reached? The measure tells state
      Corrections Director Terry Stewart that for each new inmate
      he receives, someone else has to go.</p>

      <p>"This particular bill gives me the keys to the back door,"
      Stewart told lawmakers. "That's something you need to think
      about."</p>

      <p>Rep. Laura Knaperek, R-Tempe, said she has. "It's a money
      issue," said Knaperek, who chairs the Appropriations
      Committee.</p>

      <p>It costs $50 million to build a 1,000-bed prison. And
      housing each one including everything from corrections
      officers to guard them to the food to feed them, computes out
      at $58 a day.</p>

      <p>By contrast, home arrest costs only $13.31 a day. Stewart
      said, though, the legislative solution is oversimplistic
      because he does not have the people to do the kind of
      monitoring necessary.</p>

      <p>"The community's not going to be safe if I can't supervise
      them in the community because I don't have home arrest
      officers," he said.</p>

      <p>There would be some limits on Stewart's powers. He could
      not release people convicted of certain violent crimes, sex
      offenses or dangerous crimes against children. Those who are
      sentenced as dangerous or repetitive offenders also would be
      ineligible.</p>

      <p>Those released would have to remain home except when
      permitted out for specific activities, like work, counseling
      or shopping. They would be subject to electronic monitoring,
      have to be employed or otherwise in "gainful" activities, be
      required to submit to drug and alcohol tests and mandated to
      pay at least a small part of the monitoring charge.</p>

      <p>The release program is only part of the plan to save money
      on housing inmates. Another provision specifies that anyone
      sentenced in Pima or Maricopa county to less than a year in
      prison must do their time at a county jail -- without the
      state reimbursing them the cost.</p>

      <p>Rep. Russell Pearce, R-Mesa, said that makes no sense, and
      not only because it unloads the state's burden on the
      counties. He said the counties lack the rehabilitation
      programs available in prisons, such as one operated by the
      state for repeat drunken drivers.</p>

      <p>Knaperek responded that the state's two largest counties
      have a sufficiently large tax base to absorb the extra cost.
      "That's why we have exempted the smaller counties," she
      said.</p>

      <p><span>The legislative provision on circumcision stems from
      the discovery that the <a href="http://www.ahcccs.state.az.us/" target="_blank">Arizona Health Care Cost Containment
      System</a> is charged $132 every time the procedure is performed.
      And with more than 12,600 baby boys born last year to women
      enrolled in the state health care program, that adds
      up.</span></p>

      <p><span>Sen. Ruth Solomon, D-Tucson, who chairs the Senate
      Appropriations Committee, said lawmakers needed to seek out
      and eliminate every program that is not necessary.</span></p>

      <p><span>"There are all kinds of reports now that say it
      isn't medically necessary," she said.</span></p>
