            <h2>HIV mystery in Kenya: Spouses escape infection</h2>

            <p>Mike Pflanz</p>

            <p>KISUMU - Britain is funding a study into how tens of
            thousands of HIV- positive Kenyans have mysteriously
            not passed the virus to their husbands or wives.</p>

            <p>Almost $840,000 was set aside from Britain's annual
            $8 million in HIV and AIDS grants to Kenya to research
            160,000 "discordant couples" in Nyanza province on the
            shores of Lake Victoria.</p>

            <p>Rates of HIV and AIDS are among the highest in the
            world along the lake's shores. Kisumu, the provincial
            capital, and its surrounding lowlands are some of
            Kenya's most densely populated regions. Local customs
            are thought to boost infection rates. <span
            class="yellow">The dominant Luo tribe have an aversion
            to circumcision and practise a tradition where if a
            husband dies, his brother inherits his wife.</span></p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Yet limited early surveys
            showed that up to 40 per cent of people with HIV in the
            area had not passed the virus to their partners,
            despite regularly engaging in unprotected sex over long
            periods of marriage.</span></p>

            <p>The research echoes findings of an earlier study of
            Nairobi prostitutes who developed an apparent immunity
            to HIV despite being among the most at risk in a
            country where some 1.7 million carry the virus.
            Scientists are mystified.</p>

            <p>"Essentially there are still great gaps in what we
            know about discordant couples, but we have been able to
            make some guesses," said Dr James Gesami, Nyanza's
            chief provincial medical officer.</p>

            <p>"We have a lot of people who travel far to work,
            maybe they are only seeing their wives once every two
            months, even once a year, so they are having sex less.
            Maybe they are not being rough when they have
            intercourse, or maybe the survey was done at a time
            when new infections were at a low point."</p>

            <p>"Whatever the reason, we want to make sure we reach
            as many of these discordant couples and get them tested
            so that we can counsel them if one is still negative,
            and keep them negative," said Marilyn McDonagh, Kenya
            program director for health for Britain's Department
            for International Development.</p>

            <p>Mark Miser, a 25-year-old trader from Bondo, 95
            kilometres west of Kisumu, first learned he was HIV
            positive a year after he married his wife, Judith, in
            2000. At first he kept the news secret from her, and
            the couple continued to have unprotected sex.</p>

            <p>"I was so afraid that if I told her, she would leave
            me," he told <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>

            <p>"I knew there was such a chance she would get the
            illness. So we finally went for a test together in
            2003. I did not tell her I already knew my status. To
            my surprise, she was negative. I just realized we were
            so lucky and we had to follow the rules to stop her
            getting HIV."</p>
