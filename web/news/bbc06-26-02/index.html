            <h2>South African youths die during rituals</h2>

            <h3 class="title">Rituals mark the transition to
            manhood</h3>

            <p class="text">Five teenage boys have died and 51
            others have been injured during initiation rituals in
            South Africa.</p>

            <p class="text">Police found the youths when a boy died
            on his way to hospital on Monday, after rituals
            involving circumcision and beatings.</p>

            <p class="text">Four instructors have been arrested and
            are being questioned by police.</p>

            <p class="text">The BBC's Barnaby Phillips in
            Johannesburg says that although the South African
            authorities have tried to regulate initiation schools
            to avoid such incidents, some provinces keep practising
            the rituals.</p>

            <p class="text">In this latest incident, the boys, aged
            between 13 and 18, had been attending several so-called
            "bush schools", including one outside the towship of
            Ratanda, in the Heidelberg hills, near
            Johannesburg.</p>

            <p class="text">Police say the initiates, of the Sotho
            and Xhosa ethnic groups, were exposed naked to
            sub-freezing temperatures, and that many had
            circumcision-related infections and bruised backs.</p>

            <p class="text">The survivors are now being treated in
            hospital. Eighteen of them are in a critical
            condition.</p>

            <p class="text">"They have been diagnosed with
            pneumonia, lung infections, bronchitis," police
            spokeswoman Anneline Prinsloo said.</p>

            <p class="text">The chief of emergency services in
            Heidelberg, Terrance Niemach, was critical.</p>

            <p class="text">"They should not be circumcised under
            these conditions and come out here in this cold," he
            said.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Lack of hygiene</h3>

            <p class="text">The boys were apparently provided with
            no shelter, little water and no toilet facilities.</p>

            <p class="text">One local newspaper quotes one of the
            instructors as saying the ceremonies were intended to
            turn the boys into strong men.</p>

            <p class="text">In South Africa, the operations are
            usually performed in June and December, during school
            holidays.</p>

            <p class="text">Young men in many African societies
            traditionally undergo training involving rituals and
            circumcision to mark the transition to manhood.</p>

            <p class="text">They rejoin society with a man's status
            once their wounds have healed.</p>

            <p class="text">Our correspondent says that while some
            traditional leaders have accepted new regulations to
            make the rituals safer, others have resisted and
            accused the government of interfering in cultural
            affairs.</p>
