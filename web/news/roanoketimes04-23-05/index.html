            <h2>Man takes on circumcision as his cause celebre</h2>

            <p>By Joe Kennedy<br />
            THE ROANOKE TIMES</p>

            <p>In the fast-paced world of column writing, it's a
            luxury to sit down and interview someone more than once
            before beginning to tell his or her story.</p>

            <p>On Monday, I interviewed William Stowell of
            Fincastle. Once was plenty.</p>

            <p>Stowell, 23, has become a poster child for the
            anti-circumcision movement.</p>

            <p>Wednesday night, he is scheduled to appear on
            Showtime's "Penn &amp; Teller: Bulls-t!" He will help
            to debunk the belief that the practice of circumcision
            has any social, sexual, medical or other value. In
            fact, he says, it does harm.</p>

            <p>It won't be his first brush with the big time.</p>

            <p>In recent years, Stowell and/or <a
            href="http://firms.findlaw.com//llewellynlaw/practices.htm"
             target="_blank">his personal-injury lawyer</a> have
            appeared on "Good Morning America," MSNBC and other
            outlets. They and their cause have turned up in The New
            York Times, Penthouse and Playboy.</p>

            <p>Stowell became attractive to producers and editors
            in 2003 after a <a
            href="http://goodsamaritan.chsli.org/"
            target="_blank">Long Island hospital</a> and doctor
            settled his lawsuit against them. The suit questioned
            the legality of his mother's consent for his
            circumcision the day after he was born.</p>

            <p>It said Linda Stowell was weakened by a Caesarean
            section and groggy from painkillers when a nurse
            obtained her permission for the procedure.</p>

            <p>It also questioned the legal and ethical aspects of
            removing healthy tissue from a nonconsenting minor for
            "non-therapeutic" reasons.</p>

            <p>The terms of the settlement are private. There was
            no admission of liability, but that didn't stop
            Stowell's lawyer, David Llewellyn of Atlanta, from
            commenting afterward.</p>

            <p>A new niche</p>

            <p>"Never again can someone say that a young man who is
            dissatisfied with his circumcision as an infant is
            being frivolous when he objects to his mutilation and
            brings suit to obtain justice," Llewellyn said. "I
            would expect that this is just the first of many cases
            that will be brought by angry circumcised young men
            against their circumcisers."</p>

            <p>It is important to note that Stowell's circumcision
            was not botched. The "mutilation" described by his
            lawyer applies to any circumcision, botched or not.</p>

            <p>For more than a year Stowell and, he says, a retired
            Alleghany County urologist, have paid for a billboard
            in Roanoke. Formerly at Franklin Road and McClanahan
            Street Southwest, the message now is on Brandon Avenue
            near Deyerle Road.</p>

            <p>It faces west, toward Salem. It says, "Today's
            babies are born perfect. Parents say NO to
            circumcision."</p>

            <p>On Monday, I met with Stowell at the billboard.</p>

            <p>It was the first time I've ever sat with a guy - in
            his grandmother's Caprice, yet - and talked at length
            about penises.</p>

            <p>To put it bluntly, Stowell believes doctors should
            keep their circumcising gadgets away from babies.
            Circumcision, he says, is the mutilation of an innocent
            victim for no compelling health reason.</p>

            <p>The decision should be left to the child, not the
            parents, he says. Which means, unless there's some
            obvious medical benefit, there should be no more infant
            circumcisions.</p>

            <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics determined in
            1999 that the potential medical benefits of
            circumcision are not sufficient for it to be part of
            routine neonatal care. The academy also acknowledged
            that the procedure causes pain to infants and
            recommended the use of painkillers.</p>

            <p>The AAP did not call for a ban on circumcisions.
            Parents choose them for several reasons, including
            religious and cultural traditions.</p>

            <p>America leads the world in male circumcision rates,
            Stowell says, but in recent decades the U.S. rate has
            dropped to just over 50 percent of newborns, and lower
            in some areas. Partly, this is because of increased
            births among ethnic groups that do not choose to have
            their newborns circumcised.</p>

            <p>Eric Earnhart, spokesman for Carilion Health System,
            said veteran nurses in the birthing unit at <a
            href="http://www.carilion.com/crch/"
            target="_blank">Carilion Roanoke Community Hospital</a>
            have seen little or no change in circumcision rates for
            several years.</p>

            <p>"Their gut feeling ... is that it's going on at
            about the same percentage" as it has for some time.</p>

            <p>While Earnhart could not give a figure, he said the
            majority of infants born at the hospital get
            circumcised.</p>

            <p>If you'd like to delve into the subject further, you
            can e-mail Stowell at <a
            href="mailto:NoCircVA@aol.com">NoCircVA@aol.com</a>.</p>

            <p>Or you can go online to numerous anti-circumcision
            Web sites.</p>

            <p>A compelling question</p>

            <p>Stowell is 23, married and the father of a
            2-year-old daughter. He receives disability payments
            for a back injury he suffered while serving in the Air
            Force, he says.</p>

            <p>He attends <a href="http://www.dl.cc.va.us/"
            target="_blank">Dabney Lancaster Community College</a>,
            where he works as an audiovisual technician. He also
            drives a sweeper truck that cleans commercial parking
            lots.</p>

            <p>His interest in circumcisions began during summer
            camp when, at age 15, he noticed the foreskin of an
            uncircumcised boy in a communal shower.</p>

            <p>The foreskin is the loose fold of skin that covers
            the glans of the penis.</p>

            <p>"It got me to thinking, 'Where was mine?'" he
            said.</p>

            <p>In time, he found Internet sites that address the
            subject. He learned the history of the practice and
            asked his parents why they permitted him to be
            circumcised.</p>

            <p>"I found out they didn't want to have it done," he
            said. "They did it anyway, virtually without my
            mother's consent."</p>

            <p>He sued and won separate settlements from the doctor
            and the hospital, or, rather, their insurers.</p>

            <p>And that is how he became somewhat well-known.</p>

            <p>Regaining lost ground</p>

            <p>Circumcision is "not a parent's choice," Stowell
            says. The decision belongs to the person with the
            penis.</p>

            <p>He speaks so authoritatively that I felt a need to
            ask if he were a good student in high school.</p>

            <p>"I was a degenerate," he said. "I was always getting
            suspended for something."</p>

            <p>Stowell and others believe that uncircumcised males
            get and give better orgasms than circumcised males
            do.</p>

            <p>"Full-bodied orgasms - and often, too," he told
            me.</p>

            <p>They believe their circumcisions rob them of their
            rightful portion of sexual pleasure, because the
            foreskin contains many important nerves. Once they're
            gone, pleasure is permanently reduced, they say. Some
            men employ nonsurgical techniques to restore their
            foreskins, at least partially. There is equipment that
            does this.</p>

            <p>Stowell is trying to restore his. When we spoke, he
            was three weeks into the process. He and his wife
            already had noticed an improvement, he said.</p>

            <p>Dead serious</p>

            <p>The issue of parents' choice prompted me to ask
            Stowell how he felt about parental notification laws in
            cases where minors seek abortions.</p>

            <p>"I don't take a public opinion on that issue," he
            said. "I don't want to alienate one group of my
            supporters by taking a public stand about that."</p>

            <p>Anti-circumcisionists come from many backgrounds, he
            said. Circumcision is all that some of them agree
            on.</p>

            <p>I pressed him. He said abortion and circumcision
            were two different things.</p>

            <p>I said there is a parallel in that both involve
            parents in children's medical decisions.</p>

            <p>He disagreed.</p>

            <p>Abortion, he said, is "a complete extermination of a
            being." Circumcision is a "mutilation."</p>

            <p>"I don't think one is worse than the other, though,"
            he said. "Both are crimes against humanity."</p>

            <p>Circumcision opponents are lobbying state
            legislatures to restrict circumcision or remove
            Medicaid money for the procedure, as some states
            already have done.</p>

            <p>The debate has an ugly side. Some Web sites list the
            names of doctors and rabbis who perform circumcisions
            and label them "the baby mutilators."</p>

            <p>Stowell said his Roanoke Valley group has perhaps 22
            loosely defined members, most of whom would prefer to
            remain anonymous.</p>

            <p>He finds it "hard to talk to people around here"
            about the subject, but that does not deter him.</p>

            <p>"Not a day goes by that I don't mention something to
            somebody," he said.</p>
