            <h4>Health - A religious necessity for many Jews and
            Muslims, the practice has also attracted vocal
            opponents</h4>

            <p>IN THE NEWS</p>

            <p>A recent Oregon court case focused attention on
            circumcision, an enduring religious ritual for Jews and
            Muslims that is otherwise declining as a medical or
            cultural practice in Oregon.<br />
            <br />
             The state Supreme Court heard arguments from a
            divorced couple about circumcising their son. The
            father, who had converted to Judaism after the divorce,
            favored the circumcision of his 9-year-old son, who had
            expressed interest in converting. The mother argued
            that the boy was afraid to tell his father that he
            didn't want to be circumcised.<br />
            <br />
             In January, a lower court ruled in favor of the
            father, who has custody of his son. The mother
            appealed. The Supreme Court <a
            href="http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/S054714.htm"
             target="_blank">decided</a> that the boy, now 12,
            should have a chance to weigh in. The case is still
            pending.<br />
            <br />
             Custody rights may be at the heart of the Oregon case,
            but it has sparked discussion of circumcision -- the
            removal of all or a portion of the foreskin of the
            penis. For centuries, Jews have circumcised infant
            boys. They cite the book of Genesis, in which God
            commands that Abraham, his son and their descendants be
            circumcised as a sign of their divine covenant.<br />
            <br />
             Ordinarily, a bris milah, Hebrew for "covenant of
            circumcision," is held on the eighth day of a boy's
            life, at home in front of family and friends. A trained
            mohel performs the ritual. In recent years, some Jewish
            families have had their sons circumcised in the
            hospital by a specially trained Jewish physician. The
            family holds a naming ceremony at home on the eighth
            day.<br />
            <br />
             In Islam, circumcision is a religious rite and usually
            occurs by a boy's seventh birthday.<br />
            <br />
             In the United States, infant circumcisions are often
            performed for secular reasons. Parents choose to have
            sons circumcised so they will look like their fathers
            or blend in in a locker room, or because they believe
            the procedure aids with cleanliness or reduces
            disease.<br />
            <br />
             Some circumcised men argue that the procedure has
            lessened their sexual sensitivity. Medical studies
            suggest that circumcision reduces the risk of penile
            cancer, urinary tract infections and HIV transmission.
            But the American Academy of Pediatrics reaffirmed in
            2005 that there was insufficient evidence to consider
            the procedure a medical necessity.<br />
            <br />
             In Oregon, about 26 percent of boys born in 2006 were
            circumcised in hospitals. The figure, based on state
            and national statistics, does not include infants
            circumcised outside of hospitals.<br />
            <br />
             Nationally, the figure for infant circumcision
            declined from 65 percent in 1980 to about 56 percent in
            1997 and has been relatively stable since.<br />
            <br />
             Regionally, fewer boys are circumcised in the West: In
            2005, 31 percent were circumcised in hospitals there.
            The figures were 75 percent in the Midwest, 65 percent
            in the Northeast and 56 percent in the South.</p>
