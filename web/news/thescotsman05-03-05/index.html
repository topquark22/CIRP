            <h2>Muslim Accused of Assaulting Son Through
            Circumcision</h2>

            <p>By James Tapsfield, PA</p>

            <p>A Muslim "assaulted" his five-year-old son by having
            him circumcised against his mother's wishes, a court
            heard today.</p>

            <p>The father is alleged to have secretly taken the boy
            to a doctor in north London for the procedure.</p>

            <p>Lewes Crown Court heard he then told the mother - an
            English Christian - what had happened and said: "There
            is nothing you can do."</p>

            <p>The 27-year-old man - who lives in Crawley, West
            Sussex, but cannot be named for legal reasons - denies
            committing an assault occasioning actual bodily harm in
            August 2003.</p>

            <p>Irena Ray-Crosby, prosecuting, told the court today
            that the parents had been involved in a three-month
            relationship and the mother realised she was pregnant
            after they broke up.</p>

            <p>Once the defendant, who is of Moroccan origin,
            realised the child was his he began raising the issue
            of circumcision in line with his religious beliefs.</p>

            <p>"He told (the mother) he wanted to have the boy
            circumcised and she said she would agree with that only
            for medical reasons and never for religious ones."</p>

            <p>The court heard that in August 2003 - shortly after
            the boy's fifth birthday - he went to stay with his
            father.</p>

            <p>The defendant telephoned the mother and asked her to
            come out of her house to talk to him, at which point he
            told her about the circumcision.</p>

            <p>According to Ms Ray-Crosby, the mother accused him
            of assaulting their son, and the defendant responded:
            "There's nothing you can do. I've looked into it and
            it's perfectly legal."</p>

            <p>He later sent her a text message saying she should
            give the boy salty baths in order to help him heal.</p>

            <p>The court heard that the father had been "under
            pressure" from fellow Muslims to get his son
            circumcised, and paid &pound;100 in cash for the
            procedure to be carried out.</p>

            <p>Ms Ray-Crosby said the defendant had admitted when
            arrested and interviewed by police that he had not told
            the mother in advance of his plans. She added that
            there had been no medical reason why the boy needed to
            be circumcised.</p>

            <p>"This is not a case that is anti-Islam or anti-any
            other faith. It's simply about a boy who was
            circumcised without his mother's consent."</p>

            <p>Ms Ray-Crosby said the father had never applied for
            legal parental responsibility, and therefore could not
            have provided proper consent for the operation to take
            place.</p>
