            <h2>2 die of botched circumcisions</h2>
            23/06/2005 11:55 - (SA) 

            <p>Cape Town - Two would-be-initiates have died in the
            Eastern Cape since the start of the winter circumcision
            season, the <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/municipality/content.asp?PageID=742&amp;buster=2005%2F06%2F19+04%3A15%3A29+PM#"
            target="_blank">provincial health department</a> said
            on Thursday.</p>

            <p>Spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said department officials
            and police, working with traditional leaders, had
            raided and shut down several illegal initiation
            schools, arrested two traditional nurses and a surgeon,
            and were hunting down other surgeons who had
            circumcised boys illegally.</p>

            <p>When they raided an illegal school at Mgwenyane
            village in the Libode area on Wednesday, they had
            arrived while circumcisions were being carried out on a
            group of 29 youths.</p>

            <p>"We witnessed a terrible thing. The man was
            circumcising these boys using one blade," he said.
            "This illustrates the reason why the department has had
            to intervene in traditional circumcisions. What it
            means is that if the first boy out of the 29 is
            HIV-positive, the rest of the boys have probably been
            infected with the virus."</p>

            <p>He said only five circumcisions had been carried out
            by the time the authorities arrived.</p>

            <p>The surgeon had been taken into custody by the
            Libode police and was to appear in court on
            Thursday.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said one boy died at the weekend of
            septicaemia at Engcobo near Umtata, and another, from
            Sada near Queenstown, died as a result of dehydration
            on Monday.</p>

            <p>He said there would be no prosecutions as both boys
            had been attending legal schools. The Engcobo boy had
            been in the care of his parents when he died, and the
            Sada boy had been in hospital.</p>

            <p>Under the province's law on traditional
            circumcision, schools must be registered with the
            department, parental permission must be obtained, and
            surgeons must follow particular procedures.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said members of the public at Mdantsane had
            since Monday handed over to police three bogus surgeons
            who had been circumcising under-age boys in the
            area.</p>

            <p>"What is encouraging this year is that the community
            call us and inform us of the wrongdoers in their area,"
            he said.</p>

            <p>One of the calls had come from health MEC Monwabisi
            Goqwana's home village Cingo in the Tsolo area, where
            in a raid on Tuesday night authorities rescued 11 boys
            and arrested a traditional nurse.</p>

            <p>An enraged Eastern Cape businessman, Justice Zotwa,
            said on Thursday that his 14-year-old nephew Sixolile
            had been taken to an illegal circumcision school in the
            Bizana area without his parents' permission.</p>

            <p>Sixolile disappeared last week before writing his
            final grade five mid-year exam at school in Flagstaff,
            and after searching for days his family reported him
            missing to the police.</p>

            <p>This week, however, the family found out he had been
            circumcised.</p>

            <p>"There was no permission that was asked from us,"
            Zotwa said. "The boy was very young and it was a very
            unacceptable thing which was done.</p>

            <p>"I feel bad, I feel angry. It's actually
            frightening, and it's threatening the lives of our
            children. Somebody comes and takes your son without
            knowing, without your permission."</p>
