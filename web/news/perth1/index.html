        <h2>The cruel cut that ruined a man's life</h2>

        <h4>by Bruce Butler</h4>
      </center>

      <p>A PERTH man has won a $360,000 damages payout after a WA
      doctor admitted he botched a circumcision operation which
      left the man with a badly deformed penis. <font
      color="navy">[CIRP note: This is roughly equivalent to
      US$235,000.]</font></p>

      <p>The man, 26, who was operated on at birth, has never had
      sexual intercourse.</p>

      <p>Due to a lack of information on neonatal circumcision, he
      grew up believing he was deformed. He was unable to obtain an
      erection until he had corrective surgery at the age of
      18.</p>

      <p>The man, who wants to be known only as "John", said he has
      a permanent lack of sensation in his penis but has also
      suffered extreme pain.</p>

      <p>He suffered severe psychological problems from his late
      teens which led to an attempted suicide at 18, six months
      after partially successful reconstructive surgery.</p>

      <p>In January 1992 when his injuries were diagnosed as a
      bungled surgery, he turned against his parents, hating them
      for allowing the awful operation to be done.</p>

      <p>In 1997 he sued the GP who circumcised him.</p>

      <p>This month John received an out-of-court settlement after
      the doctor admitted liability for the injuries and agreed to
      the payout.</p>

      <p>His lawyer Hayden Stephens, from law firm Slater and
      Gordon, said the payout was one of the biggest in Australia
      for that type of injury.</p>

      <p>"This young man has suffered a horrific consequence as a
      result of this negligent procedure and he now has to live
      with the problem for the rest of his life," Mr Stephens
      said.</p>

      <p>"I am really pleased for him, but no amount of money will
      ever truly compensate him for the injuries he has
      suffered."</p>

      <p>Now completing a doctorate in medical science, John said
      he took legal action in a bid to draw attention to
      circumcision and to try to eradicate it in Australia, if not
      the world.</p>

      <p>He said circumcision was a disgusting, unnecessary act of
      mutilation which the medical profession had forced on
      unsuspecting parents for years.</p>

      <p>"For my whole life I've been imprisoned in pain and exiled
      from pleasure. I'm serving a prison sentence for a crime that
      someone else committed---that's the reality for me," he
      said.</p>

      <p>In John's operation, still routinely performed without
      anaesthetic in Australian hospitals, almost all the penile
      skin was removed which prevented the penis from growing
      normally.</p>

      <p>John said: "Parents want to see their children grow up to
      live healthy and happy lives and many parents have consented
      to circumcision because the Australian medical profession
      convinced them it was a quick and painless procedure that was
      essential to avoid health problems.</p>

      <p>"Not only is the claim that it is beneficial wrong, the
      AMA has not adequately informed parents of the surgical risks
      involved.</p>

      <p>"I took legal action against the doctor who circumcised me
      because I hate circumcision and I wouldn't be able to live
      with myself if I did nothing to stop other babies being
      injured and mutilated in the same way as me.</p>

      <p>"I don't want to walk down the street and see a young
      mother with baby boys and wonder and worry whether they've
      had done to them what was done to me."</p>

      <p>Born in 1973, John's "routine" operation became a
      nightmare he has had to cope with all his life.</p>

      <p>The young GP who delivered him cut away far too much skin
      and had to stretch the remaining soft, scrotal tissue and
      stitch it in place.</p>

      <p>The result was a mess.</p>

      <p>"The shape isn't right, the length isn't right---it's
      shorter than it should be---and the glans (head) is actually
      twisted a bit," John said.</p>

      <p>Believing he was deformed, he hid from embarrassing
      changeroom and shower situations at school.</p>

      <p>Throughout adolescence---difficult enough years when all
      is well---the psychological harm matched his physical
      scars.</p>

      <p>He was more interested in science than sport and became
      withdrawn and studious.</p>

      <p>He prospered academically but psychologically was crying
      for help.</p>

      <p>When he went to university, he realised he had a serious
      problem and the bungled circumcision was diagnosed.</p>

      <p>He fought severe depression and contemplated suicide but
      opted for surgery, hoping it could save him.</p>

      <p>"The pain involved in that was horrific and it lasted for
      years and still now I get aches and pains from time to time,"
      he said.</p>

      <p>"With all the pain, the psychological trauma and
      embarrassment that went with having that surgery, it wasn't
      worth it.</p>

      <p>"But I was 18 years old, I had something very badly wrong
      with me and I was desperate.</p>

      <p>"I had to try something."</p>

      <p>Skin was taken from his upper thighs and grafted to his
      penis, but he was left with little real sensation.</p>

      <p>The grafted skin had unsightly leg hairs growing from it,
      which required electrolysis and caused further scarring.</p>

      <p>He remains angry that he was circumcised unnecessarily and
      that the medical profession continues to push the operation
      on unknowing parents. He is outraged that 12 per cent of
      Australian boys are still circumcised.</p>

      <p>"Babies should never be circumcised," he said.</p>

      <p>"My case was a totally unnecessary circumcision. Yet my
      mother and father were told it was essential for me to be
      circumcised to avoid health problems."</p>

      <p>John said some medical authorities still claimed
      circumcision reduced the rate of HIV infection and sexually
      transmitted diseases---a claim he says has been proven wrong
      by medical data.</p>

      <p>He said it was wrong that doctors, who charged about $200
      to perform a circumcision, continued to make a small fortune
      from such a potentially harmful procedure.</p>

      <p>"I have been assaulted and mutilated and for my whole life
      I am living with an injury," he said.</p>

      <p>John said his injuries had made it almost impossible to
      contemplate a relationship with a woman and he found it hard
      to make friends.</p>

      <p>He was angry with his parents but he now acknowledged the
      operation was not their fault.</p>

      <p>His mother, a close and loving supporter who carries her
      own guilt over the surgery, said: "He's never had a
      relationship with a woman because of how he feels about his
      body.</p>

      <p>"At the most important stage of his life when he should
      have been dating and girls were showing an interest in him,
      he withdrew."</p>

      <p>She said they should have been told how to clean a boy's
      foreskin, not advised to have a circumcision.</p>

      <p>His mother also regretted the blunder was not diagnosed
      earlier so he could have had corrective surgery at a younger
      age.</p>

      <p>John said he would like to see a support group established
      in Australia for men who have problems due to
      circumcision.</p>

        <h2>Doctors divided over operation</h2>

        <h4>By John Carey</h4>
      </center>

      <p>THE medical profession remains divided over the issue of
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>Only about 5 per cent of male babies born in WA in the
      past two years have undergone the procedure, suggesting that
      parents are less likely to want their sons circumcised.</p>

      <p>But it is still common enough, its opponents say, that <a
      href="http://www.pmh.wa.gov.au/" target="_blank">Princess
      Margaret Hospital for Children</a> admits half a dozen baby
      boys each year suffering from infection or hemorrhaging
      because of it.</p>

      <p>Princess Margaret Hospital specialist Dr Philip King said
      it was an unnecessary operation performed on babies when they
      were most vulnerable to infection and bleeding.</p>

      <p>He said only 4 per cent of boys required circumcision for
      medical reasons---in cases of trauma or infection---but
      "every year we see babies coming in with circumcision who
      have nasty infections and require surgery".</p>

      <p>"Foreskin is a very normal part of the human body," he
      said. "It is a very important part throughout life. It's the
      right of the child that he should keep his foreskin---it's
      not the right of the parents to chop it off."</p>

      <p>In the US, he said, there had been six cases in which
      children successfully sued parents for choosing to
      circumcised when it was unnecessary.</p>

      <p>But Dr King said he would perform the procedure, if
      necessary, to ensure the highest standards of safety.</p>

      <p>"If parents are absolutely insistent that their child be
      circumcised, then I will provide them with the best possible
      environment to be circumcised," Dr King said.</p>

      <p>"The message is: go to a pediatric surgeon who will do it
      in a respected hospital with a pediatric anaesthetist."</p>

      <p>Another surgeon who regularly performs both ritual and
      routine circumcisions said the crucial issue was the
      technique used to perform the operation.</p>

      <p>"I don't think it is barbaric if it is done quickly and
      properly," he said.</p>

      <p>Different techniques provide different levels of
      discomfort for the baby."</p>

      <p>The surgeon, who declined to be identified by name, said
      there was also some reason to be concerned that medical
      practitioners, who were opposed to circumcision, might
      inadvertently intimidate parents who wanted the procedure
      done on their sons in order to express their religious
      convictions.</p>

      <p>"The should be able to practise the religious rights
      without feeling intimidated by society," he said.</p>
