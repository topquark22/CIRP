            <h2>Judge takes father's side in circumcision feud</h2>
            October 24, 2006 

            <p>BY CARLA K. JOHNSON Associated Press</p>

            <p>A Cook County judge has sided with a divorced father
            who did not want his 9-year-old son circumcised, in a
            case that has drawn attention from groups opposed to
            the medical procedure.</p>

            <p>Circuit Judge Jordan Kaplan's ruling, issued
            Tuesday, said <span class="yellow">the boy can decide
            for himself when he turns 18.</span> Until then, there
            will be no circumcision, a surgery that removes the
            foreskin of the penis.</p>

            <p>The boy's parents had feuded over the procedure in
            court. The couple's 2003 divorce decree gave the father
            the right to offer advice on medical decisions. When
            the two disagreed, he sued to block the
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>The father believed circumcision could cause the boy
            long-term physical and psychological harm. The child's
            mother wanted the procedure to prevent recurring
            infections.</p>

            <p>The Associated Press is not naming the parents to
            protect the child's privacy. The father was born and
            raised in Poland; The mother is from Slovakia. Both now
            live in suburban Chicago.</p>

            <p>In his ruling, Kaplan called circumcision <span
            class="yellow">''an extraordinary medical procedure as
            it relates to a nine-year-old child.''</span></p>

            <p>Alan Toback, the father's attorney, said the father
            is extremely happy with the judge's decision and feels
            he saved part of his son's anatomy.</p>

            <p>A telephone call from The Associated Press to the
            mother's attorney on Tuesday was not immediately
            returned. The mother had testified that her son
            suffered five bouts of painful inflammation and had
            begged her to help him.</p>

            <p>The case reflects a national debate over the medical
            necessity of circumcision. In 1999, the American
            Academy of Pediatrics reversed its support of routine
            infant circumcision, citing questionable benefits and
            medical and anecdotal evidence that circumcised men
            have less penile sensitivity.</p>

            <p>Most U.S. newborn boys are circumcised before they
            leave the hospital, <span class="yellow">but a growing
            number of parents are opting against the
            surgery.</span></p>
