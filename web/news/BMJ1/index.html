      <h2>Misdiagnosis May Lead to Needless Circumcisions in
      UK</h2>

      <p><b>NEW YORK (Reuters Health)</b> - Too many unnecessary
      circumcisions are being performed in the UK, British
      researchers report. Currently, about 3.8% of boys in England
      are circumcised. However, only about 0.6% of boys actually
      require the procedure due to medical necessity, a report
      suggests.</p>

      <p>The main cause of unnecessary circumcisions is
      misdiagnosis of phimosis--a condition in which the foreskin
      cannot be pulled back over the head of the penis, according
      to <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/321/7264/792">the
      report</a> published in the September 30th issue of the
      British Medical Journal.</p>

      <p>``Too many English boys, especially those under 5 years of
      age, are still being circumcised because of misdiagnosis of
      phimosis,'' write Anthony. M. K. Rickwood, of the department
      of urology at <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.alderhey.com/homepage.html">Alder Hey
      Children's Hospital</a> in Liverpool, and colleagues.</p>

      <p>``At birth, the foreskin is almost invariably
      non-retractable, but this is transient and resolves in nearly
      all boys as they mature,'' the authors note.</p>

      <p>What's more, ``a reduction in the proportion of English
      boys circumcised to an attainable target of 2% would make for
      about 6,000 fewer circumcisions each year, with a
      corresponding saving of 3 million pounds.''</p>

      <p>Although the exact frequency is unknown, it is estimated
      that 1.2 million newborn males are circumcised in the United
      States annually at a cost of between $150 million and $270
      million. This practice has been advocated for reasons that
      vary from symbolic ritual to preventive health measures.
      Until the last half century, there has been limited
      scientific evidence to support or repudiate the routine
      practice of male circumcision, according to the American
      Academy of Pediatrics.</p>

      <p>``Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential
      medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; however, these
      data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal
      circumcision. In circumstances in which there are potential
      benefits and risks, yet the procedure is not essential to the
      child's current well-being, parents should determine what is
      in the best interest of the child,'' the AAP writes in a <a
      href="/library/statements/aap1999/">policy statement</a>.</p>

      <p><font color="navy">[CIRP Note: CIRP estimates that if the
      U.S. non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision rate was to be
      reduced from about 60 percent to 2 percent, there would be
      about 1,044,000 fewer circumcisions performed annually, at an
      annual cost savings of at least $208,800,000.00 in surgeon's
      fees alone without regard for hospital charges.]</font></p>
