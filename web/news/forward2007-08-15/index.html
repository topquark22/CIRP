            <h2>Religious Rights on Trial as Circumcision Case
            Reaches Oregon&rsquo;s High Court</h2>

            <h4>AJCongress Counsel: &lsquo;We Have To Win This
            Case, and Win it Big&rsquo;</h4>
            Jennifer Siegel | Wed. Aug 15, 2007 

            <p>The highest-level case in American history involving
            the right to circumcision is slated to be heard this
            fall, when the <a
            href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/"
            target="_blank">Oregon Supreme Court</a> rules on
            whether a father can have his 12-year-old son undergo
            the procedure.<br />
            <br />
             The case &mdash; which could affect the ability of
            parents to make religiously motivated decisions for
            their children &mdash; is bound up with a bitter
            custody dispute between a divorced Oregon couple. It
            pits James Boldt, the custodial parent and a recent
            convert to Judaism, against Lia Boldt, who argues that
            the boy is afraid to tell her ex-husband that he does
            not want to be circumcised. She says that the boy would
            be physically and psychologically harmed by the
            procedure.<br />
            <br />
             The acceptance of the case by Oregon&rsquo;s highest
            court is surprising, because judges generally grant a
            wide degree of latitude to custodial parents &mdash; so
            much so, in fact, that the state&rsquo;s Court of
            Appeals rejected the mother&rsquo;s case without
            issuing an opinion. If the Oregon Supreme Court decides
            to review the merits of the father&rsquo;s plan for
            circumcision, it will almost inevitably weigh in on two
            related issues: the right of custodial parents to guide
            their children&rsquo;s religious upbringings, and the
            weight that religious considerations should be given
            when considering the welfare of a child.<br />
            <br />
             &ldquo;Are parents only authorized to make decisions
            that a secular decision-maker would make?&rdquo; asked
            Marc Stern, general counsel for the <a
            href="http://www.ajcongress.org/"
            target="_blank">American Jewish Congress</a>, which is
            filing a friend-of-the-court brief in support of James
            Boldt. &ldquo;We have to win this case, and win it big,
            in my view&rdquo; Stern said.<br />
            <br />
             &ldquo;Our position is that the custodial parent can
            take into account religious interests in determining
            what&rsquo;s in the interest of the child,&rdquo; Stern
            added.<br />
            <br />
             Historically, the American courts have given parents
            wide latitude in making decisions rooted in religious
            belief. In one seminal 1972 case, <a
            href="http://laws.findlaw.com/us/406/205.html"
            target="_blank">Wisconsin v. Yoder</a>, the Supreme
            Court upheld the right of Amish parents to remove their
            children from public school after the eighth grade,
            despite a law mandating education through age 16. At
            the same time, many judges have stepped in to protect
            children from health risks posed by religiously
            motivated parental decisions in the contexts of blood
            transfusions and medical treatment.<br />
            <br />
             Given the high stakes of the Boldt case, which is
            scheduled to be heard sometime this fall, advocates on
            both sides of the dispute are weighing in.<br />
            <br />
             &ldquo;Our position is that you do not cut off healthy
            tissue from a child,&rdquo; said John Geisheker,
            executive director and general counsel of <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>,
            which is filing a friend of the court brief on behalf
            of Lia Boldt. &ldquo;The boy has a right to be secure
            in his own body. Parents can believe in anything they
            like, but when it comes to religious practices, those
            cannot endanger the child in any way.&rdquo;<br />
            <br />
             Stern said he is in the process of drafting the brief
            for AJCongress and expects several other major Jewish
            organizations to sign on.<br />
            <br />
             One notable exception is the <a
            href="http://www.adl.org/"
            target="_blank">Anti-Defamation League</a>, which has
            been prominent in a number of church-state cases.
            According to a spokeswoman, Myrna Shinbaum, the ADL is
            not taking a position in the matter, as it is
            &ldquo;essentially a custody dispute.&rdquo;<br />
            <br />
             If some are reluctant to weigh in on Boldt, it may be
            because of a complicating factor at the heart of the
            case: the boy himself. Called &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; by
            his father and &ldquo;Mischa&rdquo; by his mother, and
            bounced from her home to his in the wake of an ongoing
            custody battle, he has aged three years as the
            circumcision case has wound its way to the Oregon
            Supreme Court. While both sides in the dispute claim to
            have the boy&rsquo;s support, his own testimony has yet
            to be requested by the courts.<br />
            <br />
             Since the 1950s, the Supreme Court, in the context of
            cases involving both contraception and abortion, has
            generally expanded the rights of teenagers when it
            comes to their own bodies. <a
            href="http://www.law.harvard.edu">Harvard Law
            School</a> professor <a
            href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/facdir.php?id=45"
             target="_blank">Martha Minow</a>, an expert in family
            law and in cases involving religious rights, would like
            to see that precedent extended in Oregon.<br />
            <br />
             &ldquo;If the child at issue is 12 years old, a court
            would rightly consider that individual&rsquo;s own view
            &mdash; about religion and about the procedure at issue
            &mdash; perhaps not as the ultimate basis for the
            decision but as a vital input,&rdquo; Minow wrote in an
            e-mail to the <i>Forward</i>. &ldquo;Legally, morally,
            and practically, the view of an emerging adolescent
            would be highly germane here just as it would for a
            medical decision facing a pregnant teen.&rdquo;</p>
