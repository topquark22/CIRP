            <h2>Circumcision drive 'going well'</h2>

            <p>Umtata - The Eastern Cape provincial <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/department_overview.asp?departmentID=4&amp;menuid=204&amp;mainmenuid=21"
             target="_blank">health department</a> says the R1m
            allocated to awareness-raising programmes on the
            problems of traditional circumcision practices has been
            well spent.</p>

            <p>"The programme has worked well and a lot of
            unnecessary incidents have been avoided", said the
            department's Sizwe Kupelo.</p>

            <p>He said that since the department had started the
            programme in May the public had been helping to
            identify illegal operations, and <span
            class="yellow">105 traditional surgeons had been
            arrested.</span></p>

            <p>In the Pondoland area, 141 initiates had been
            "rescued" when the MEC closed illegal schools in the
            region.</p>

            <p>He said the programme was focused not only on
            traditional surgeons (ingcibi), but also on "broader
            circumcision issues and the possible cholera outbreaks
            in the province".</p>

            <p>"We targeted all stakeholders to promote prevention,
            and engaged other services."</p>

            <p>He said the department ran adverts in the local
            media and engaged non-governmental organisations to
            facilitate education through plays, and visited
            traditional authorities.</p>

            <p>The department held a "very successful" five-day
            awareness programme with live outside broadcasts in
            five towns in the province, said Kupelo.</p>

            <h5>Some are still sceptical</h5>

            <p>"Even today, the public still informs us about
            illegal activities".</p>

            <p>The money was also used to build temporary
            structures for initiates from closed-down schools.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said new projects in the pipeline included
            putting up billboards around the province and
            conducting more workshops for the iingcibi.</p>

            <p>Despite departmental claims, other stakeholders in
            the region are less certain of the programme's
            success.</p>

            <p>The chairperson of the Eastern Cape House of
            Traditional Leaders, Chief Ngangomhlaba Matanzima, said
            he was aware of the efforts made by the department, but
            felt it was too soon to judge whether the situation had
            improved.</p>

            <p>"With regard to training of traditional surgeons I
            can say they have succeeded, but otherwise I think it
            is too early to judge whether the programme has had
            positive spin-offs", he said.</p>

            <p>"The programme has not sunk in to people yet - maybe
            next year in December the results will be more
            visible."</p>

            <h5>'Stamp out the fly-by-nights'</h5>

            <p><a href="http://www.paca.org.za/"
            target="_blank">Pan Africanist Congress</a>
            spokesperson Zingisa Mkabile said the department needed
            to set up a permanent structure with co-ordinators at
            district level.</p>

            <p>"My gut feeling is that the situation has not
            changed much. (They should) stop treating this matter
            as a seasonal thing", said Mkabile.</p>

            <p>The <a
            href="http://www.da.org.za/DA/Site/Eng/DEFAULT.htm"
            target="_blank">Democratic Alliance</a>'s Eddie Trollip
            said R1m was not a lot of money to spend in trying to
            save someone's life.</p>

            <p>He urged the department to "work with traditional
            communities and all stakeholders to stamp out
            fly-by-night iingcibi".</p>

            <p>"It is a shame that young men are dying in this
            traditional rite of passage, whereas this was not the
            case previously", said Trollip.</p>
