          <h2>Wanted haredi extremists flee country</h2>
          By <a href="mailto:etgar_l@yahoo.com">ETGAR LEFKOVITS</a>

          <p>A group of haredi extremists suspected of being part
          of a pirate circumcision network that carried out illegal
          circumcisions on dozens of Russian teenagers in Jerusalem
          has fled the country and remains at large, police said
          Monday.</p>

          <p>The haredi zealots allegedly performed the illicit
          circumcisions on the 16-17-year-old youths in a private
          city apartment in exchange for presents and without the
          consent of their parents.</p>

          <p>The affair came to light after the mother of one of
          the teens discovered what had happened to her 16-year-old
          son and filed a complaint with police, Jerusalem police
          spokeswoman Sigal Toledo said.</p>

          <p>Jerusalem police subsequently raided a city apartment
          where the suspects allegedly carried out the
          circumcisions, but the suspects had already fled the
          country, she said.</p>

          <p>According to police, the alleged cell leaders would
          solicit teens, most of whom were Russian-born and had not
          undergone circumcision as babies, in schools outside of
          Jerusalem and cajole them into undertaking the operation
          in exchange for gifts.</p>

          <p>They would then be driven to Jerusalem during the
          night for the operation.</p>

          <p>The complainant gave police a copy of a videotape she
          found in her son's room, in which the whole illegal
          circumcision procedure was documented.</p>

          <p>Police said the circumcisions were carried out in the
          apartment without basic sanitary conditions.</p>
