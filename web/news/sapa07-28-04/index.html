            <h2>Initiation likened to war</h2>
            28/07/2004 12:45 - (SA) 

            <p>Mdantsane - The controversy surrounding botched
            circumcisions at initiation schools is well known but a
            new phenomenon is taking place - naming initiation
            schools after war torn cities and countries around the
            world.</p>

            <p>Now Mdantsane schools carry names like Afghanistan
            (Zone 12), Kuwait (Zone 1), Beirut (Zone 5), Bosnia
            (Nxaruni), Rwanda (Zone 3) and Panama City (Zone
            12).</p>

            <p>Others such as Sun City (Zone 9 and Zone 16,
            Sacramento (Zone 9) and Atlanta (Zone 17) do not have
            quite the same ring, but nevertheless indicate a novel
            trend that is catching on quickly.</p>

            <p><i>The Daily Dispatch</i> this week visited some of
            the camps and asked initiates why the schools were
            getting such names. The majority of the newly graduated
            young men agreed that the names - particularly of
            countries that have been ravaged by war - were derived
            from the tough life these youngsters anticipate when
            they are in the bush.</p>

            <p><b>Initiation schools similar to a war zone</b></p>

            <p>Sinethemba Mgcebele, 17, who was circumcised at Zone
            2 initiation school, said when initiates go into the
            schools, they think of themselves as being on the
            warpath. To them, going to the schools is similar to a
            brave soldier who is facing a war situation.</p>

            <p>Those who have never gone through the ritual regard
            circumcision as a heroic deed that only brave boys
            undertake. They enter the schools with the
            understanding that they are not going to be in for a
            luxurious life, but experience only pain and suffering.
            As a result, they feel some connection to people in
            places like Afghanistan, Beirut, Rwanda and Bosnia who
            have known the suffering of war.</p>

            <p>Being in the schools the initiates expect no mercy
            from their traditional surgeons (Iingcibi) and
            traditional nurses (<i>amakhankatha</i>). They are
            expected to abide by the tough rules of the custom,
            that demands that they sacrifice all the comforts of
            home.</p>

            <p>Not only that, but many are victims of illegal
            circumcisions in which they pay varying amounts to
            unauthorised traditional surgeons (<i>ingcibi</i>) to
            perform illegal operations on their genitals.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Often these operations go
            horribly wrong and scores of youths die or are
            mutilated in the camps every season.</span></p>

            <p>The <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/municipality/content.asp?PageID=742&amp;buster=2005%2F06%2F19+04%3A15%3A29+PM"
             target="_blank">Health Department</a> said the abusive
            treatment of initiates by traditional nurses and other
            men could have a bearing on the naming of these
            initiation schools.</p>

            <p>Department provincial spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo
            believes that the naming might have been influenced by
            the manner in which these people treated the
            initiates.</p>

            <p>However, Kupelo said the names did not matter to his
            department. "We do not care how they name them, but our
            concern is unnecessary deaths, "he said. Kupelo added
            that it was up to the custodians of the custom, who are
            traditional leaders, to change those names. He said all
            his department wanted was to ensure that the lives of
            initiates were saved.</p>

            <p>Children as young as 12 years have been circumcised,
            two of them in Duncan Village recently. In terms of the
            custom and irrespective of their age, these children
            will from now on enjoy equal manhood status with their
            elders.</p>

            <p>This means that other children of their age group
            must accord them with the same respect they give the
            elderly men - if they survive Afghanistan, Beirut or
            Rwanda.</p>
