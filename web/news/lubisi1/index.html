      <h2>Circumcision Rites Contribute To Dismal Pass Rates</h2>
      March 12, 2001

      <p>Dumisane Lubisi<br />
      Pietersburg, South Africa</p>

      <p>Circumcision ceremonies have been blamed for the dismal
      pass rate at 16 rural schools in the Northern Province where
      less than 10 percent of matriculants passed last year.</p>

      <p>Eleven of the schools whose pass rates were particularly
      poor, are situated in deep rural Sekhukhuneland where boys
      are often out of school for three months each Winter to be
      initiated at traditional bush schools.</p>

      <p>This was revealed at a one-day motivational workshop for
      the schools' principals in Pietersburg last week. Principals
      said schools were left almost empty during the circumcision
      period, when boys between ages of 15 to 20 undergo an intense
      right of passage into manhood.</p>

      <p>Provincial education spokesman Freddy Greaver said the
      department would meet with the owners of initiation schools
      to try resolve the massive absenteeism at mainstream schools.
      "This has contributed so much to the schools' bad matric
      results that we have to do something about it," he said.</p>

      <p>Other key factors that contributed to the low pass rate
      was a lack of morale amongst teachers, and principals' and
      parent's lack of interest in their children's education, the
      workshop heard. Some schools continue to suffer a shortage of
      mathematics and science teachers and also lack stationery,
      textbooks and furniture.</p>

      <p>Greaver said the teacher redeployment programme would
      ensure the necessary teachers were deployed to needy schools.
      "The process is faced with some hiccups, like resistance from
      teachers, but we will have to move some teachers to areas in
      need," he said.</p>

      <p>Newly appointed education MEC Joyce Mashamba told the
      principals to seek means of solving the problems they faced.
      She also encouraged them to write down their grievances so
      the department could address them.</p>
