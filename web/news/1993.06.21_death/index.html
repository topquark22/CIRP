            </center>
            Miami, June 26, 1993 

            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The Miami Herald reported the death of 6 month old
            Carol City baby, Demetrius Manker. Manker bled to death
            after being circumcised.</p>

            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            "I can't express the way it has affected me
            emotionally," the child's mother, Louise Manker, said.
            "It's something I'll never get over. This was my last
            child." A Miami pediatrician circumcised 25-pound
            Demetrius Manker in his office. After his mother took
            him home, she saw he was bleeding from the
            incision.</p>

            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Manker subsequently called the doctor several times,
            according to their attorney, Patrick Cordero.</p>

            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            "One of the instructions was that she put Vaseline
            around the penis area to stop the bleeding." Cordero
            said, "she followed the instructions to the
            letter."</p>

            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Louise Manker's sister grew so alarmed by his continued
            bleeding that she called paramedics, Cordero said. He
            was pronounced dead at the hospital.</p>

            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            An autopsy showed that his liver and other organs had
            gone pale from the loss of blood, said Dade [County]
            Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Charles Wetli.</p>

            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            "The message to get across is that <a
            href="/news/desmoinesregister11-20-82/">this is weird,
            unusual</a>," Wetli said. "I've done close to six
            thousand autopsies and this is the first I've seen
            where a baby died from circumcision. <a
            href="/library/general/baker1/">It's probably the
            safest procedure you could think of</a>.</p>

            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            An <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/pdf/DemetriusMankerAutopsy1993.pdf"
             target="_blank">autopsy</a> revealed a seemly normal
            circumcision, Wetli said.</p>

            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The doctor who performed the surgery, Robert D. Young,
            said the circumcision had gone well. "I would not have
            let him go home if I didn't think so. Medical examiners
            will confirm the soundness of the operation.</p>

            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Authorities say they will try to determine if the baby
            suffered from some rare disease that prevented his
            blood from coagulating. It's also possible that Louise
            Manker did not understand the extent of the bleeding,
            especially because a baby has a fraction of an adult's
            blood supply, Wetli said.</p>

            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            "There's two parts to the story," the deputy medical
            examiner said, Why was the child bleeding? And secondly
            what was the level of communication if the mother said
            he's bleeding but didn't say how much.</p>
