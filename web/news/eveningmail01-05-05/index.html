            <h2>Doctor 'operated on boy without anaesthetic'</h2>

            <p>Jan 5 2005</p>

            <p>By Staff Reporter, Evening Mail</p>

            <p>A seven-year-old boy writhed around and screamed in
            agony when a doctor who was <a
            href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/standards/circum.htm"
            target="_blank">circumcising</a> him failed to top up
            his anaesthetic when the procedure went wrong.</p>

            <p>Dr Mohamed Khursheed Alam, of Farquhar Road,
            Birmingham, stitched him back up without numbing the
            area first, the <a href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/"
            target="_blank">General Medical Council</a> was
            told.</p>

            <p>The experience left seven-year-old Mohammed Abdul
            Shaid "psychologically disturbed", the <a
            href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/probdocs/default.htm"
            target="_blank">Fitness to Practice</a> Panel
            heard.</p>

            <p>The youngster, known as Shaid, was being circumcised
            by his family's GP in accordance with his Muslim faith.
            He went to the surgery on Burbury Street, Lozells,
            Birmingham, with his mother, grandfather, aunt and
            uncle and was ushered into the treatment room in August
            2003.</p>

            <p>After a few minutes, Shaid's mother Juleka Bibi
            could hear that her son was not happy, the GMC was
            told. Mr Enoch said: "She could hear that her son was
            crying and in distress, shouting, '<i>Don't cut me with
            scissors</i>'."</p>

            <p>The family carried the seven-year-old home and put
            him to bed, but half an hour later he started to cry
            and complain of pain.</p>

            <p>He was rushed back to the surgery where without
            giving the child another anaesthetic and without
            putting on protective gloves, the GP began trying to
            suppress the bleeding.</p>

            <p>Eventually the concerned relatives ignored the
            doctor's instructions and phoned for an ambulance, and
            the boy went to hospital. He stayed in overnight but
            did not require further treatment.</p>

            <p>Dr Alam denies serious professional misconduct.</p>
