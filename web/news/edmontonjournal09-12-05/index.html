            <h2>Circumcision debate isn&rsquo;t over yet</h2>

            <h4>Parent and doctor advocates reopen the snipping
            issue</h4>

            <p><b>Chris Zdeb</b><br />
             Journal Staff writer<br />
             Edmonton</p>

            <p>EDMONTON - To snip or not to snip, that is still the
            question for parents of newborn baby boys even though
            circumcision rates continue to decline in Canada.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a huge issue,&rdquo; says Dione
            Chambers, who says she and her husband were split on
            what to do with their son Tanner, now two.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I was against it just because it seems to be
            the norm not to do it and because our doctor
            doesn&rsquo;t support circumcision, but he (her
            husband) was adamant (circumcision) was the way it was
            going to be because of family history.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Chambers did a lot of research online and through
            books, looking at the pros and cons of both sides and
            found enough information to sway her to her
            husband&rsquo;s side.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;It was a stressful decision at the time and I
            was really kind of regretting it the day of, but I have
            no regrets now,&rdquo; she says.</p>

            <p>Nothing stirs up debate like circumcision because
            once people have decided where they stand on the issue,
            they&rsquo;re unlikely to change their opinion, says
            Dr. Peter Nieman, a Calgary pediatrician who speaks for
            the pediatric section of the <a
            href="http://www.albertadoctors.org/"
            target="_blank">Alberta Medical Association</a>. He
            toes the line of the <a href="http://www.cps.ca/"
            target="_blank">Canadian Pediatric Society</a> and the
            <a href="http://www.aap.org/" target="_blank">American
            Academy of Pediatrics</a> which is that circumcision is
            unnecessary surgery. He won&rsquo;t do it, but believes
            it should be done by an experienced surgeon and will
            help parents who want it, to find one.</p>

            <p>Circumcision or the removal of the foreskin of the
            penis became a standard medical procedure in the
            western world in the mid to late 1900s.</p>

            <p>It&rsquo;s now considered &ldquo;cosmetic
            surgery&rdquo; since research began to emerge
            questioning earlier studies that said the procedure
            staved off serious infections, cancer and AIDS, and
            people became more aware of the pain caused to the
            baby.</p>

            <p>The procedure is now done with local anesthetics,
            but babies used to be snipped with no pain relief. One
            <a href="/library/pain/taddio2/">study</a> carried out
            before the use of anesthetics found boys who were
            circumcised were more sensitive to pain when they got
            their immunizations at a later age, than boys who
            weren&rsquo;t circumcised.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;It was almost as if they had a memory of pain
            because of the circumcision,&rdquo; Nieman says.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Alberta parents have had to pay
            for the procedure themselves since circumcision was
            deinsured in 1987.</span></p>

            <p>The procedure is done in doctors&rsquo; offices and
            on an outpatient basis in hospitals, but Nieman
            remembers when it was part of the hospital delivery for
            parents who asked for it. Hospital administrators,
            hoping to discourage parents from snipping their baby
            boys, introduced a &ldquo;tray fee&rdquo; of $15 to
            $20, supposedly to cover the cost of cleaning the
            instruments used in circumcision.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">It didn&rsquo;t really
            discourage parents, Nieman says, so many hospitals just
            stopped doing circumcision. He estimates 20 to 30 per
            cent of baby boys are <a
            href="http://www.courtchallenge.com/refs/yr99p-e.html"
            target="_blank">circumcised in Alberta</a> today, down
            from around 60 to 80 per cent, 20 years ago.</span></p>

            <p>Dad James Sutter says it cost $260 to have his seven
            and a half month old son Zachary, circumcised at the
            Grey Nuns Hospital, almost twice as much as it cost for
            his son Josh, who is three, and more than four times
            the $60 it cost to have his oldest son snipped 10 years
            ago.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;We knew right away we wanted them
            circumcised,&rdquo; say Zachary and Josh&rsquo;s mom
            Susan. &ldquo;We still discussed it, but we
            didn&rsquo;t disagree. It was partly medical and partly
            what&rsquo;s been done in the family in the
            past.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Sutter says the decision was based on the fact that
            it&rsquo;s easier to keep a circumcised penis clean
            reducing the risk for bacterial infections. When he
            heard of one husband who had to be circumcised at the
            age of 25, he figured it was better to get the
            procedure done when the boys were small.
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better for them in the long
            run.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Nieman says most circumcisions are done because
            fathers who are circumcised want their sons to look
            like them.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;The moms are like: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want
            this done. My poor son. But I love my husband and
            he&rsquo;s the boss, so we&rsquo;ll do it,&rsquo;
            &rdquo; Nieman says. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d see a
            lot less circumcisions if moms made the
            decision.&rdquo;</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://adc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/90/8/772#1630"
             target="_blank">Dr. Edgar Schoen</a>, an outspoken
            proponent of infant male circumcision, says Canadian
            moms must be wimps, or words to that effect. American
            mamas make the decision of whether or not to circumcise
            their sons, he says, and a growing number of them want
            it done for all the medical reasons opponents of
            circumcision reject.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a growing body of published
            medical scientific research about the medical benefits
            of circumcision that a sophisticated American public is
            becoming more and more aware of,&rdquo; he says.</p>

            <p>Schoen cites some of the &ldquo;15, 20, 30&rdquo;
            studies in his new book Ed Schoen, MD on Circumcision.
            Among their findings: circumcised men don&rsquo;t get
            penile cancer and are more resistant to getting
            syphilis and AIDS when exposed to them; they are 10
            times less likely to develop urinary tract infections
            and severe kidney infections that can cause permanent
            kidney damage.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, opponents of circumcision have
            only &ldquo;anecdotes and testimonials&rdquo; to back
            up their case, Schoen says.</p>

            <p>Aside from the medical evidence is the social
            advantage that comes with being circumcised, he
            says.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;In the U.S. if you&rsquo;re not circumcised,
            it means generally that you&rsquo;re an immigrant, the
            son of immigrants or you&rsquo;re very poor.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Schoen says it&rsquo;s a tragedy that anti-circ
            groups have successfully lobbied legislatures in 13
            states, including California, not to cover the cost of
            circumcision for welfare patients.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Poor people in this country know if a boy is
            uncircumcised and somebody sees him in the locker room
            that ... he&rsquo;s at a social disadvantage so they
            scrape together enough money to pay for circumcision
            even though they can&rsquo;t afford it.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Hospital-based <a
            href="/library/statistics/USA/">statistics</a> show
            approximately 55 per cent of American male infants are
            circumcised, though Schoen argues the rate is actually
            around 80 per cent because the numbers don&rsquo;t
            include procedures done in doctors&rsquo; offices or
            during religious ceremonies.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;The American public is way ahead of the
            pediatric organizations in their support of
            circumcision,&rdquo; he says.</p>

            <p>The reason the American Academy of Pediatrics
            continues to say circumcision is medically unnecessary
            is because it doesn&rsquo;t want to admit that
            it&rsquo;s wrong, says Schoen, who chaired a task force
            on circumcision for the Academy in 1989. Eventually
            even they won&rsquo;t be able to ignore the evidence,
            he says.</p>

            <p>Anti-circ crusaders say the U.S. is the last bastion
            of circumcision in the developed world, but Schoen says
            it&rsquo;s actually the first bastion. He&rsquo;s
            confident as more information about the medical
            benefits of circumcision gets out, helmet-heads (the
            circumcised) will eventually outnumber anteaters (those
            who are not) in most countries.</p>

            <h3>Letter, Calgary Herald, Sept. 25, p. A15:</h3>

            <p><b>Circumcision - Re: &ldquo;Circumcision debate
            isn&rsquo;t over yet,&rdquo; Sept. 15.</b></p>

            <p>The central issue in the circumcision debate is the
            ethics of performing an irreversible, medically
            unnecessary operation on an infant. Although some
            studies have found circumcision may have medical
            benefits, these benefits are marginal and disputed.</p>

            <p>Circumcision&rsquo;s risks are well-documented.
            Occasionally, the complications are serious. <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/thewestern08-31-02/"
            target="_blank">Three years ago, a baby boy died after
            his circumcision in Penticton, B.C.</a></p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Exposing children to such
            levels of risk, for a questionable benefit, would never
            be tolerated in any other health care
            context.</span></p>

            <p class="yellow">Medical regulatory bodies in Canada
            have begun issuing formal policies discouraging infant
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>In 2002, the <a href="http://www.quadrant.net/cpss/"
            target="_blank">College of Physicians and Surgeons of
            Saskatchewan</a> advised doctors to convey the <a
            href="/library/statements/sask2002/"
            target="_blank">message</a> that this is not a
            recommended procedure. In 2004, the <a
            href="https://www.cpsbc.ca/" target="_blank">College of
            Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia</a>
            released a <a
            href="https://www.cpsbc.ca/cps/physician_resources/publications/resource_manual/malecircum"
            target="_blank">policy</a> noting infant circumcision
            &ldquo;is particularly difficult in regards to human
            rights.&rdquo; The <a
            href="http://www.cpsa.ab.ca/home/home.asp"
            target="_blank">College of Physicians and Surgeons of
