            <h4>A one-sided account of a debatable medical
            procedure</h4>

            <p>The <a
            href="http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-circumcision28nov28,0,3440434.story?coll=la-home-health"
             target="_blank">L.A. Times</a> just got tough about
            circumcision. They cite a new study, published in
            Public Library of Science Medicine, showing that
            circumcised boys are less like to get the HIV virus
            than uncircumcised boys. From this, the L.A. Times
            leaps to the conclusion that all boys should be
            circumcised. As they put it, &ldquo;Circumcision may
            protect against HIV infection, new studies suggest. But
            more parents are forgoing the surgery.&rdquo; While
            lauding the benefits of circumcision and lamenting the
            declining circumcision rates in the United States, the
            Times is diverging from advice given by the American
            Academy of Pediatrics (APP). The APP currently
            maintains that there is no medical reason for all boys
            to undergo the procedure. And it is not changing its
            position because of this new HIV study.</p>

            <p>The study was conducted in South Africa, where
            infection rates for HIV are high and increasing. Two
            groups of boys were randomly assigned to undergo, or
            not, circumcision. Those boys who underwent the surgery
            were less than half as likely to get the HIV virus.
            Such strong numbers are extremely important, and highly
            suggestive that, in an environment in which HIV
            infections are common, circumcision could play a
            preventative role.</p>

            <p>So why didn&rsquo;t the AAP change its tune?
            Doesn&rsquo;t preventative medicine clearly dictate
            that all boys &ndash; and even adults who are still
            clinging to their foreskin &ndash; be circumcised as a
            matter of routine? Clearly, this is the suggestion
            given by the L.A. Times in quoting Robert Bailey, a
            lead author of the study &ldquo;One of the benefits
            [circumcision] has is that it is permanent and protects
            every time."</p>

            <p>The reason that doctors haven&rsquo;t jumped is
            buried in the numbers. Numbers that the L.A. times
            didn&rsquo;t bother to write about. The actual
            likelihood of any individual getting HIV in the United
            States is extremely low. The L.A. Times cites the
            statistic that there are 40,000 new HIV cases a year in
            the United States. However, they do not break that up
            into the categories of infection that might be affected
            by circumcision. The new infection rate includes babies
            get HIV from their mothers and teens get infections
            through sharing needles. Based on information published
            by the <a
            href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/stats/hasrlink.htm"
            target="_blank">Center for Disease Control</a>, STATS
            estimates that the number of new male infections due to
            unprotected sex is about 21,000 per year. And if we
            assume that the rate is halved if the men were
            circumcised (a conservative assumption, since many of
            the new infections are already circumcised men), we
            reduce new infections by about 11,000 per year by
            circumcising every male baby in the country. And there
            are more than 2,000,000 new baby boys born in the
            United States each year. That&rsquo;s a lot of
            circumcisions for the benefit &ndash; a reduction of
            5.5 HIV infections per 10,000 circumcisions.</p>

            <p>While it is true that there are decreased rates of
            urinary tract infections, penile cancer, HIV, and some
            sexual transmitted diseases among circumcised boys and
            adults, all of these problems occur in an extremely
            small percentage of the population. Condoms and reduced
            exposure to others with the virus minimize the chance,
            while drug use and unprotected sex increase the risk.
            The L.A. Times&rsquo; recommendation would fare better
            in populations with high risk. This may include some
            cities and some subpopulations in the U.S., but does
            not mean the whole country. The current rate of HIV
            (not AIDS) infection in the United States is estimated
            at 136.7 per 100,000 people (CDC, 2004), or just over 1
            person per 1,000.</p>

            <p>With a lifelong-risk of under 0.15%, Americans are
            justified in making their decisions about circumcision
            independent of the possibility of HIV infection. Quite
            reasonably, parents who are reluctant to expose their
            children to the known risks of circumcision (most
            notably, infection, pain, scarring, and bleeding) may
            not feel that the reduced HIV risk is worth it.</p>
