      <p>An ACT man <a href="/news/perth1/">awarded $360,000
      compensation after a botched circumcision</a> will speak at
      an international symposium on genital mutilation in
      Washington this week.</p>

      <p>Shane Peterson said his message was simple - circumcision
      was unnecessary and dangerous.</p>

      <p>The 28-year-old man found it difficult to speak publicly
      about his "very traumatic experience" but put his fear aside
      to educate parents and save other men from a similar
      fate.</p>

      <p>Mr Peterson said he was circumcised shortly after birth
      but the doctor removed far too much tissue which left him
      scarred.</p>

      <p>Mr Peterson, when aged 18, underwent reconstructive
      plastic surgery which involved several skin grafts. He
      received $360,000 in damages in 1999 from the doctor who
      performed the circumcision.</p>

      <p>"That might seem like quite a lot of money but money could
      never compensate me for the pain I endured and the permanent
      loss of sexual enjoyment," Mr Peterson said.</p>

      <p>"I see the money as a token of recognition rather than
      compensation.</p>

      <p>"The penis is an <a
      href="/library/anatomy/taylor/">important sensory organ</a>
      and is permanently damaged by circumcision.</p>

      <p>"The amputation of part of the penis should be governed by
      the same rules which apply to the amputation of other body
      parts - urgent medical need, a serious pathological condition
      and informed consent."</p>

      <p>Mr Peterson said adult men should decide whether to be
      circumcised.</p>

      <p>"Parents should not have the right to surgically impose
      their sexual, cosmetic or aesthetic preferences on children.
      It is for the child to decide when he or she reaches the
      legal age of consent," he said.</p>

      <p>Mr Peterson will speak at the <a
      href="http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/seventh/symp02.pdf"
      target="_blank">7th International Symposium on Human Rights
      and Modern Society</a> held in Washington from April 4-7 to
      coincide with Genital Integrity Awareness Week.</p>
