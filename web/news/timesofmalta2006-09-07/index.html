          <h2>Seven operations cancelled due to MRSA microbe</h2>

          <p>Seven operations due at <a href="" target="_blank">St
          Luke's Hospital</a> yesterday were called off after a
          patient in Fairyland, the children's ward, was diagnosed
          with <a
          href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/DOC/mrsa.html"
           target="_blank">antibiotic-resistant MRSA</a>, the
          hospital said.</p>

          <p>The hospital administration said the operations
          cancelled consisted of circumcision and hernia, adding
          they were not "urgent" interventions.</p>

          <p>"In a similar case last week, six operations had to be
          cancelled. In this case, each operation has been
          re-scheduled", the hospital's information officer, Tonio
          Bonello, said.</p>

          <p><span class="yellow">MRSA can lead to a number of
          conditions such as a skin disease known as furunculosis,
          blood poisoning, suppuration of wounds and inflammation
          of the bone marrow</span> and patients who contract it
          are usually kept in isolation to prevent the infection
          from spreading.</p>

          <p>The St Luke's Hospital administration said they were
          taking all measures to disinfect the children's ward,
          warning that more operations may have to be cancelled in
          the coming days.</p>

          <p>"Most MRSA patients would not have encountered the
          microbe from hospital but would have carried the virus
          when admitted," the hospital said.</p>
