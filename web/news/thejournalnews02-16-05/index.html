            <h2>State gets rabbi's herpes test</h2>

            <p>By JAMES WALSH<br />
             THE JOURNAL NEWS</p>

            <p>(Original publication: February 16, 2005)</p>

            <p>The state Health Department has received the herpes
            test results of a Monsey rabbi suspected of passing on
            the virus to infants during a circumcision ritual.</p>

            <p>State health officials subpoenaed the test results
            Friday, "but at this point in time, they're for
            internal use only," said Robert Kenney, a state Health
            Department spokesman.</p>

            <p>Rockland County, Orange County and New York City
            health officials have prohibited Rabbi Yitzchok
            Fischer, 66, from performing a portion of the ritual
            that entails sucking blood from the wound.</p>

            <p>Three infants circumcised by Fischer, including one
            who died, had contracted herpes, according to the New
            York City Health Department.</p>

            <p>Fischer's attorney, Mark Jay Kurzman of Pearl River,
            was upset yesterday that word of the subpoena had
            reached the media.</p>

            <p>"I have no comment on what ought to be a
            confidential, discreet governmental investigation,"
            Kurzman said.</p>

            <p>He also would not comment on a court session
            scheduled for today regarding the prohibition against
            Fischer's performing the full circumcision ritual.</p>

            <p>Gabriel Taussig, chief of the administrative law
            division of the New York City Law Department, confirmed
            yesterday that the city had complied with the subpoena
            but declined to discuss the test results.</p>

            <p>Taussig said today's court session in Manhattan was
            to be a conference among all the parties. The city is
            seeking a preliminary injunction that would prohibit
            Fischer from performing the full ritual until the case
            is resolved.</p>

            <p>The ritual, which involves the sucking of blood, is
            predominantly used by Hasidic Jews.</p>

            <p>The circumcisions by Fischer drew the attention of
            public health officials after a Manhattan newborn died
            of herpes in November, and his twin was diagnosed with
            the virus, about two weeks after their circumcisions. A
            third infant, from Staten Island, also was diagnosed
            soon after his bris.</p>

            <p>County health departments do not regulate the
            religious ritual.</p>
