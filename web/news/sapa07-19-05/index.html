            19/07/2005 15:41 - (SA) 

            <p>East London - The circumcision season ended in the
            Eastern Cape on Sunday with 20 boys dead from botched
            operations, the <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/municipality/content.asp?PageID=742&amp;buster=2005%2F06%2F19+04%3A15%3A29+PM#"
            target="_blank">provincial health department</a> said
            on Tuesday.</p>

            <p>Eastern Cape health department spokesperson Sizwe
            Kupelo said that the department had arrested 15
            traditional health practitioners throughout the season.
            The worst area was Pondoland, where 12 boys died.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">"In the past week there were at
            least seven deaths. This means that 20 boys in total
            have died throughout the season," Kupelo
            said.</span></p>

            <p>"But schools have reopened and there are few
            initiation schools left, so workloads have gone down.
            The circumcision season has ended."</p>

            <p><b>Illegal</b></p>

            <p>Kupelo said the department had used about 400
            surgeons, 425 officials, about 80 4x4 vehicles and
            three helicopters in the fight against illegal
            circumcisions.</p>

            <p>"The department is going to review the season to see
            where we went wrong and what needs to be done to
            improve the situation."</p>

            <p>One practitioner has been charged with two counts of
            culpable homicide and will apply for bail on July
            26.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said that many traditional surgeons who had
            been arrested were let off by the police.</p>

            <p>"We will have to engage with the police and the
            National Prosecuting Authority. Some of the traditional
            health practitioners that were arrested were let off
            with warnings, without them going to court. We want to
            stop that."</p>

            <p><b>Genital amputations</b></p>

            <p>There were 5 833 boys circumcised in the Eastern
            Cape during the school holidays and of those 239 were
            admitted to hospital. <span class="yellow">Five genital
            amputations were conducted.</span></p>

            <p>Kupelo said the department had rescued 535 boys who
            had been left to die in the bush after their
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>The next circumcision season will be when the school
            holidays start in November and December.</p>
