        <h2>BOY'S DEATH TO BE PROBED</h2>

        <h3>Physician is suspended</h3>

        <p><b>by Lydia Sum and Ruth Sorelle</b></p>
      </center>

      <p>Saying they fear a "serious and immediate threat to public
      health," Texas <a
      href="http://www.hhs.state.tx.us/index.shtml"
      target="_blank">Department of Health Officials</a> sought
      permission Friday to investigate the <span
      class="yellow">death</span> of a 5-year-old boy after a
      circumcision.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Doctor's Hospital-Airline has suspended the
      anesthesiologist present during the July 18 circumcision,
      pending outcome of a peer review investigation and final
      autopsy of Jeremie Johnson.</p>

      <p>The boy died Tuesday after a week in a coma and on life
      support.</p>

      <p>Dr. T. Jose Tovar was suspended July 18, said Doctor's
      Hospital spokeswoman Jan Haines.</p>

      <p>Family members said they brought the boy to the hospital
      that day for the 30-minute procedure but he stopped breathing
      afterward and had to be resuscitated.</p>

      <p>A secretary for Tovar said the physician declined comment.
      Haines called the suspension routine in such instances.</p>

      <p>Dr. Tovar has had many good years at this hospital," she
      said. "He has always been in good standing here and many know
      him in his field."</p>

      <p>In Austin, spokeman David Vaughn said TDH officials asked
      the federal Health Care Finance Administration, which
      oversees Medicaid payments to find out why the boy died.</p>

      <p>The heath department's bureau of heath care quality and
      standards and the HCFA share responsibility to monitor
      patients' treatment in Texas hospitals, Vaughn said.</p>

      <p>He says he expects the investigation to begin early next
      week.</p>

      <p>The boy's mother, British Gaines, expressed frustration
      Friday at the lack of explanation as to why he went into a
      coma.</p>

      <p>Preliminary autopsy results only described the boy's
      medical condition when he was transferred to Texas Children's
      on July 18, Gaines said. Final results are not expected for
      another eight weeks.</p>

      <p>"It's very sad because I was thinking we'd actually find
      out something, but there are just these big, medical terms
      that don't tell us anything we don't already know," said
      Gaines, 23.</p>

      <p>In recent years, fewer boys have been circumcised because
      of conflicting medical opinion as to its necessity. But in
      some cases, medical conditions make it necessary.</p>

      <p>Gaines said she thought the procedure on her son was
      successful until Dr. Michael Morris, who performed the
      circumcision told her the boys heart had stopped and he had
      resuscitated him.</p>

      <p>Johnson was immediately transferred to <a
      href="http://www.texaschildrens.org/" target="_blank">Texas
      Children's</a>, where he was in intensive care until his
      family decided to have him removed from a respirator
      Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Gaines said Morris visited her son at Texas Children's to
      examine the result of the circumcision. She said Tovar also
      visited them at Texas Children's on July 18.</p>

      <p>He said he was sorry, that he didn't know what happened,
      and patted me on the back," Gaines said.</p>

      <p>Tovar graduated from medical school in Bogota, Colombia,
      according to the <a
      href="http://204.65.101.19/ProfileOnLine/Phys_NoticeProfile.asp"
       target="_blank">Texas Board of Medical Examiners</a> and has
      been licensed in the United States since August 15, 1970.
      Board records show no disciplinary actions against him.</p>

        <h2>FAMILY AWAITS AUTOPSY REPORT</h2>
        <b>by Lydia Lum and Ruth Sorelle</b>
      </center>

      <p>Autopsy reports may be released today explaining why a
      5-year-old boy died this week after a circumcision.</p>

      <p>Doctors at Texas Children's Hospital removed Jeremie
      Johnson from a respirator Tuesday, said Brenda Gaines, the
      boys great-aunt. He had been in a coma for a week, she
      said.</p>

      <p>Gaines said the ordeal began July 18, when she and his
      mother, British Gaines took the boy to Doctor's
      Hospital-Airline for a circumcision. Brenda Gaines said they
      believed the 30-minute procedure went successfully until a
      doctor told them the boy's heart had stopped in the operating
      room shortly after the operation.</p>

      <p>The doctors resuscitated the boy and put him on a
      respirator, Gaines said. He was taken by <a
      href="http://www.hermannlifeflight.com/" target="_blank">Life
      Flight</a> helicopter to Texas Children's she said.</p>

      <p>She said the boy never woke up.</p>

      <p>"At first we thought he was just sick because he just
      looked like he was asleep. Brenda Gaines said. "But the
      doctors said he was cold as ice."</p>

      <p>Jeremie remained in intensive care for a week and his
      mother kept a continuous vigil that resulted in her losing
      her waitress job, Gaines said. Doctors at Texas Children's
      hospital had given the boy a 50-50 chance of awakening, she
      said.</p>

      <p>Doctor's Hospital officials are investigating Jeremie's
      death, according to a statement issued by B. Lee Brown, the
      hospital administrator.</p>

      <p>We offer our deepest condolences to the family of Jeremie
      Johnson," said B. Lee Brown. "We have begun an in-depth
      review of the case to learn more about this tragedy. We hope
      to obtain additional information from Texas Children's
      Hospital to assist us in our investigation." Doctors Hospital
      refused further comment. Texas Children's spokeswoman knew
      little about the boy's case.</p>
