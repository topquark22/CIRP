            <p>By <a href="mailto:forumcap@btinet.net">Janell
            Cole</a>, The Forum<br />
            Published Saturday, September 04, 2004</p>

            <p>BISMARCK -- The mother who unsuccessfully sued <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Hospital</a> and one of its
            doctors over her infant son's circumcision won't get a
            new trial, the <a href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/"
            target="_blank">North Dakota Supreme Court</a> said
            Friday.</p>

            <p>Anita Flatt of <a
            href="http://www.hawley.govoffice.com/"
            target="_blank">Hawley</a>, Minn., also will have to
            pay more than $58,000 in costs the doctor and hospital
            incurred defending themselves, the court ruled.</p>

            <p>The justices rejected Flatt's argument that she
            received inadequate information before consenting to
            her son's circumcision shortly after his birth in 1997.
            If she had had more information, she would not have
            consented, she said.</p>

            <p>MeritCare said in a prepared statement Friday that
            it had always believed the lawsuit was without merit
            and that there were no grounds for a new trial.</p>

            <p>Flatt and her attorney, <a
            href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a> of Hawley, could not be
            reached for comment Friday.</p>

            <p>Flatt and her late husband, James, filed the lawsuit
            in 1999 on behalf of their son against <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734"
             target="_blank">Dr. Sunita Kantak</a>, MeritCare
            Medical Center and the state of North Dakota. They
            named the state as a defendant because they said a 1995
            state law that protects girls from genital mutilation
            but does not apply to circumcision of boys was
            discriminatory.</p>

            <p>The case has been watched by anti-circumcision
            activists around the country and internationally.</p>

            <p>MeritCare and the state were dismissed from the suit
            before trial. The family's claim against the doctor was
            tried before a <a href="http://www.co.cass.nd.us/"
            target="_blank">Cass County</a> jury last year.</p>

            <p>Jurors agreed with defense attorneys' arguments that
            Flatt had been told of the possible complications and
            that there is no need for doctors to outline every
            possible "insignificant" risk.</p>

            <p>The jury found Kantak not negligent.</p>

            <p>Flatt and Baer alleged afterward that there were so
            many errors committed by <a
            href="http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/bios/Rothe-Seeger.htm"
            target="_blank">District Judge Cynthia
            Rothe-Seeger</a> that they deserved a new trial. They
            said much of their witnesses' testimony was improperly
            kept out of the trial. Rothe-Seeger ruled against a new
            trial and Flatt appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>

            <p>Flatt's issues were given some credence by Supreme
            Court Justice <a
            href="http://www.ndcourts.com/History/"
            target="_blank">Dale Sandstrom</a>, who wrote a special
            concurrence with the high court's decision.</p>

            <p>He said he is "concerned that the cumulative effect
            of the trial court's decision limiting the plaintiffs'
            evidence may have denied them a fair trial," but that
            those concerns didn't rise to a level that warranted a
            new trial.</p>

            <p>During Baer's arguments at the Supreme Court in May,
            Sandstrom questioned a lower court ruling that said the
            Flatt boy did not have standing to challenge the state
            female genital mutilation law as discriminatory.</p>

            <p>"If this plaintiff doesn't have standing, who does?"
            he asked. And he wondered how a law written to
            specifically protect girls wasn't as suspect as a law
            written to protect white children but not black
            children or American Indian children.</p>
