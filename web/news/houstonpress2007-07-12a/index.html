            <h4>Surgeons not rushing to put back what they took
            away</h4>

            <p>By Craig Malisow</p>

            <p>Published: July 12, 2007</p>

            <p>If in transgender surgical procedures doctors can
            turn a penis into a vagina, why can't they give a guy
            back his foreskin?<br />
            <br />
             While there are accounts of surgical restoration,
            virtually all restoring organizations do not recommend
            it. The National Organization for the Restoration of
            Men (<a href="http://www.norm.org"
            target="_blank">NORM</a>) warns against surgery because
            "of the poor results and high cost, not to mention the
            risks associated with yet another surgery of the
            penis."<br />
            <br />
             In <i>The Joy of Uncircumcising!</i>, the restoring
            man's bible, author Jim Bigelow includes testimony of
            surgical restoration patient John Strand.<br />
            <br />
             Strand, of San Antonio, writes that he was the victim
            of a botched circumcision that left him with painful
            bumps and holes around the scar lines. The head of his
            penis often bled when it rubbed against his underwear.
            After seeing some uncircumcised boys, the young Strand
            tried desperately to pull his existing skin forward
            over his glans. The problem followed him into
            adulthood, but he writes that he was brushed off by
            doctors.<br />
            <br />
             Until, that is, he was finally referred to Dr. Don
            Greer of the <a href="http://www.uthscsa.edu/"
            target="_blank">University of Texas Health Science
            Center at San Antonio</a>'s Division of Plastic and
            Reconstructive Surgery. Greer didn't rush to do the
            surgery, but didn't send Strand away either. In May
            1977, <a href="/library/restoration/greer1/">Strand
            went under the knife</a>. Greer grafted a patch of skin
            from Strand's scrotum onto his shaft. After undergoing
            four more procedures, Strand writes, "there is some
            return of gross feeling in the graft, although by no
            means is it the equivalent of a natural
            foreskin."<br />
            <br />
             Thirty years later, the procedure doesn't appear to
            have changed much. In 2006, Canadian <a
            href="/news/thetyee2006-07-25/">Paul Tinari</a>
            petitioned the British Columbia Ministry of Health to
            subsidize restoration for a botched circumcision. The
            Ministry paid "90 percent of the $12,000" tab to graft
            scrotal skin to his shaft, according to the <i>National
            Review of Medicine</i>.<br />
            <br />
             While the physician who performed Tinari's surgeries
            claimed a success rate of 80-90 percent, <a
            href="http://www.norm.org" target="_blank">NORM</a>
            sets the rate at 60-70 percent and states that surgery
            can cost anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000.<br />
            <br />
             The Circumcision Information and Resource Pages Web
            site - a sort of clearinghouse for anti-circ
            organizations, states: "Surgical foreskin
            reconstruction procedures have been developed by
            several surgeons. Surgical reconstruction can be
            expensive and painful. Numerous complications have been
            reported. However, some men have reported satisfaction
            with it. Nonsurgical restoration is generally
            considered safer and to give superior results as
            compared to a surgical procedure."<br />
            <br />
             In addition, <a
            href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org"
            target="_blank">Doctors Opposing Circumcision</a>
            states on its Web site: "Surgical restoration has not
            proved to be satisfactory and DOC recommends surgical
            restoration be avoided. We recommend stretching
            techniques, rather than surgery, which may include
            grafts. Stretching causes permanent tissue expansion
            gradually over time."</p>
