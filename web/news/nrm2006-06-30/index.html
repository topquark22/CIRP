              <h4><i>Government pays to repair botched
              circumcision</i></h4>

              <p>By Jennifer Lalibert&eacute;</p>
            </center>

            <p>In late April Paul Tinari became the first man in
            Canadian history to have the government pay for surgery
            to reverse a botched circumcision.</p>

            <p>Armed with letters from a urologist and
            psychiatrist, the Vancouver engineer &mdash; who says
            he's been in pain for years &mdash; convinced the BC
            government to pick up 90% of the $12,000 tab. The final
            piece fell into place when he located Toronto plastic
            surgeon <a href="http://www.psurg.com/DR.htm"
            target="_blank">Dr Robert H Stubbs</a>, the only doctor
            in Canada who'd ever performed a foreskin
            restoration.</p>

            <p>"This is not something I went into lightly," says
            48-year-old Dr Tinari of the complex, multistage
            procedure he began at the end of April. "I assessed the
            risks [of the surgery] and was willing to take them.
            But I certainly wasn't willing to pay for it."</p>

            <p>The <a
            href="http://www.gov.bc.ca/bvprd/bc/channel.do?action=ministry&amp;channelID=-8387&amp;navId=NAV_ID_province"
             target="_blank">BC Ministry of Health</a> says
            requests for funding for unlisted medical procedures
            are approved only if the care isn't available in the
            province and if a medical professional has confirmed
            there's a serious medical or mental health issue. There
            were no existing rules to deal with Dr Tinari's unusual
            case. "Obviously, something like that would be granted
            coverage only in rare or extenuating circumstances,"
            says ministry spokesperson Sarah Plank. "We certainly
            don't have a billing code for it."</p>

            <p>"He got a big chunk because no one in BC does this
            and he had his urologist and psychiatrist on his side,"
            observes Dr Stubbs, who specializes in genital cosmetic
            surgery. "Some provinces are willing to do things like
            that for their citizens."</p>

            <p>RESTORATION 101<br />
             "Dr Tinari was a good candidate for the surgery," says
            Dr Stubbs, who says he doesn't know of any other
            Canadian physicians doing foreskin restoration. "He had
            sufficient donor skin and was well aware of what he was
            getting into. I select my patients very, very
            carefully," he said. In fact, Dr Tinari is only the
            third patient he's agreed to take on. "This is like
            climbing Mount Everest," he says. "It's a huge <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/library/restoration/greer1/"
            target="_blank">procedure</a>."</p>

            <p>First, the skin is cut along the circumcision scar
            line and stretched open to create a graft site. Then,
            two parallel incisions are made on the scrotum &mdash;
            the donor site &mdash; leaving a sort of bridge with
            the two ends attached on either side. "The penis is
            popped through the hole, with the skin bridge covering
            the defect you created," Dr Stubbs explains. "Then we
            let that heal for at least three weeks." In stage two,
            the two ends of the bridge are cut, separating the
            penis and scrotum. "You tuck those two pieces that are
            still dangling to the underside and keep your fingers
            crossed that enough blood vessels have grown in to
            ensure survival of the graft." Finally, when the
            swelling has subsided, the new skin is stretched over
            the penis with tape and traction weights to form a
            foreskin.</p>

            <p>PERSONAL CRUSADE<br />
             Dr Tinari sees this not just as a medical victory but
            a moral one too. He alleges that his circumcision was
            forced on him when he was eight years old by priests at
            his Montreal boarding school as punishment for
            masturbating. He says the circumcision left him
            depressed, suicidal and in chronic pain. He says his
            testicles would pull up onto the shaft of the penis
            during an erection; a segment of the glans healed to a
            small amount of remaining shaft skin, forming a <a
            href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Restric/Botched1sb.html"
             target="_blank">skin bridge</a>; stretching of that
            bridge caused intense pain during erection,
            occasionally causing tearing and bleeding during sex.
            He adds that cleaning under the skin bridge was also
            very difficult, so he suffered from chronic infections
            for years.</p>

            <p>Nowadays, Dr Tinari, who has a PhD in engineering,
            is the director of an environmental engineering company
            based in Coquitlam, BC. But he spends a lot of his time
            campaigning against circumcision and for wider access
            to foreskin restoration. "People thought that I would
            go away after the surgery, but that was just the first
            step," he says. "I did this to restore my own bodily
            integrity, but also to set a legal precedent."</p>

            <p>Given the complexity of the procedure, Dr Stubbs
            doesn't expect to see a dramatic increase in patients.
            He's staying out of Dr Tinari's legal pursuits. "I
            don't ask women why they come in for a breast implant,
            and I didn't ask him if he had an ulterior motive,"
            says the surgeon. "He may have an agenda that I don't
            know about, but this isn't something where the success
            or failure of his surgical procedure should make men
            consider this an option or not."</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Dr Tinari is still recovering; it's
            nearly two months since the surgery and his doctor is
            pleased with the outcome. "We seem to have about an
            80-90% graft survival," says Dr Stubbs. "I transferred
            a strip about 7cm wide, so he should have plenty for an
            adequate foreskin." The patient is also very pleased.
            "I've been working towards this for thirty years," says
            Dr Tinari. "I'm feeling better every day."</p>
