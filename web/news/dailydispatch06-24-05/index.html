            <h2>Setting standards for safe practice of traditional
            circumcision</h2>

            <p>THE EASTERN Cape government passed the Application
            of Health Standards in Traditional Circumcision Act in
            2001.</p>

            <p>This law sets standards for the safe practice of
            traditional circumcision, and sets the rules for giving
            permission to carry out circumcisions and run
            circumcision schools.</p>

            <p>In terms of the circumcision law, the <a
            href="http://www.ecprov.gov.za/municipality/content.asp?PageID=742&amp;buster=2005%2F06%2F19+04%3A15%3A29+PM"
             target="_blank">Health MEC</a> appoints at least one
            medical officer.</p>

            <p>It's the medical officer's job to grant permission
            to circumcise or treat initiates, and to keep records
            about circumcisions. The medical officer is allowed
            access to any occasion where circumcisions are carried
            out or where initiates are treated.</p>

            <p>Nobody may run a circumcision school without the
            written permission of the medical officer in their
            area.</p>

            <p>Nobody, including the parents or guardians of
            initiates, may interfere with the medical officer or
            prevent him from doing his job.</p>

            <p>The medical officer grants permission to experienced
            traditional surgeons to conduct circumcisions.</p>

            <p>Nobody may circumcise an initiate without the
            written permission of the medical officer in that
            area.</p>

            <p>Traditional surgeons who don't have the necessary
            experience must act under the supervision of an
            experienced traditional surgeon.</p>

            <p>The medical officer must approve the type of
            instrument which will be used to carry out the
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>Permission is not needed to treat an initiate in a
            hospital or by a medical doctor outside the traditional
            context.</p>

            <p>Both the medical officer and the person applying to
            carry out circumcisions or to run a circumcision school
            must write their full names on the document asking for
            permission, they must both sign it and the date must be
            written on it.</p>

            <p>The initiates may not be treated by anyone except a
            traditional nurse, a medical practitioner, the medical
            officer or anyone else authorised by the medical
            officer.</p>

            <p>No initiate may treat another initiate.</p>

            <p>Initiates must be at least 18 years old. If an
            initiate is younger than 21 years old, his parent or
            guardian must sign a consent form agreeing to allow him
            to be circumcised.</p>

            <p>Anyone who breaks the circumcision law could be
            convicted of an offence and fined up to R1000 or sent
            to jail for up to six months. Anyone who runs a
            circumcision school or circumcises an initiate without
            permission, could be fined up to R10000 or jailed for
            up to 10 years.</p>

            <p>For an initiate to get permission to be circumcised,
            he needs:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>A birth certificate or identity document proving
              he is at least 18 years old, or at least 16 years old
              if his parents specifically request the
              initiation;</li>

              <li>Consent from his parent or guardian if he is
              under 21;</li>

              <li>A certificate from a medical doctor, confirming
              that he passed a pre-circumcision medical examination
              and is fit to be circumcised;</li>

              <li>To find a traditional surgeon to carry out the
              circumcision who is known to his parents or guardian
              or family and who uses instruments which they approve
              of.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>At the circumcision, the instruments used must be
            sterilised and the same instrument should not be used
            for more than one initiate.</p>

            <p>If the traditional surgeon doesn't have enough
            instruments he should ask the medical officer for
            them.</p>

            <p>The traditional surgeons and traditional nurses must
            co-operate with the medical officers.</p>

            <p>At circumcision schools, the medical officer can
            inspect the school and the initiates whenever he feels
            necessary.</p>

            <p>The initiates must, at least within the first eight
            days of the circumcision, be allowed by the traditional
            nurses to have a reasonable amount of water to drink to
            avoid dehydration.</p>

            <p>The traditional nurses may not expose the initiates
            to any harmful situation or danger and must report any
            sign of illness among the initiates to the medical
            officer as soon as possible.</p>

            <p>The traditional nurse must stay at the circumcision
            school all the time for the first eight days of the
            initiation process and, after that, must visit the
            initiates at least once a day until the end of the
            initiation.</p>

            <p>The medical officer may prescribe any measure that
            may be needed for the good health of the initiates,
            which may include a departure from traditional
            methods.</p>
