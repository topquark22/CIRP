            <h2>Uganda: Museveni Cautions Youth On
            Circumcision</h2>

            <p>Fortunate Ahimbisibwe<br />
             Kampala</p>

            <p>PRESIDENT Yoweri Museveni has said circumcision
            should not be promoted in the fight against HIV/AIDS,
            as it will encourage recklessness among the
            youth.<br />
            <br />
             Addressing over 500 youth delegates who attended the
            Youth Activist Forum on Tuesday at <a
            href="http://hotelafricana.com/" target="_blank">Hotel
            Africana</a> in Kampala, Museveni said he would
            continue advocating for the ABC strategy (Abstinence,
            Faithfulness and Condoms.)<br />
            <br />
             "Some NGO's have been saying rubbish about
            circumcision but I will continue encouraging the youth
            to abstain, and use condoms only if they must. How many
            Bagisu have died of AIDS and yet all of them are
            circumcised?" he asked.<br />
            <br />
             "You would rather use a condom as a fall-back position
            but not rely on circumcision."<br />
            <br />
             Museveni warned the youth against contracting HIV/AIDS
            and encouraged them to get married immediately after
            school.<br />
            <br />
             "By the time you get your first degree when you are
            24, you should find a responsible partner and enjoy the
            rest of your lives together. Getting a partner should
            be a process but not meeting in the bus park and
            getting married."<br />
            <br />
             He added that Uganda's population growth rate was not
            a problem.<br />
            <br />
             "At 30 million, we should not be worried. Japan, which
            is about the same age as Uganda, has over 120m but it's
            a fast-developing country. Population is not the
            problem here, the problem is underdevelopment and this
            is what we are trying to address."<br />
            <br />
             On the controversial land give-aways to investors,
            Museveni said this was part of an effort to create
            employment for the youth.<br />
            <br />
             "Your enemies are the people who are delaying these
            industries and fighting for small pieces of land,
            therefore delaying employment for you."<br />
            <br />
             He warned that the Government would attach the
            property of people who get money through SACCOs and
            fail to pay it back.<br />
            <br />
             "This is not going to be like the Entandikwa. If you
            fail to pay back, your property will be
            attached."<br />
            <br />
