            <p>Published: April 16, 2012</p>

            <p>A South Dakota prison inmate is suing the hospital
            where he was circumcised as a newborn, saying he only
            recently became aware that he'd undergone the procedure
            and that it robbed him of his sexual prowess.</p>

            <p>Dean Cochrun, 28, is asking for $1,000 in
            compensatory and punitive damages. He also asks in the
            lawsuit that his foreskin be restored "in the hopes I
            could feel whole again," though he acknowledged that he
            didn't expect such a restoration to be anything more
            than aesthetic.</p>

            <p>Cochrun, who is imprisoned in Sioux Falls on a
            kidnapping conviction, filed the federal lawsuit Friday
            against Sanford Hospital. Cochrun claims that an
            "unknown doctor" at the then-named Sioux Valley
            Hospital misled his mother to believe that the
            procedure was medically necessary. Cochrun argues that
            the procedure was unnecessary, unethical and without
            medical benefit.</p>

            <p>"I was recently made aware of the fact that I had
            been (circumcised) and that ... I was robbed of
            sensitivity during sexual intercourse as well as the
            sense of security and well-being I am entitled to in my
            person," he argued in the lawsuit, adding that neither
            he nor his partners would "have that sensitivity during
            sexual intercourse and have a normal sex life."</p>

            <p>Cochrun isn't represented by a lawyer in the
            lawsuit, which includes a letter from Sanford officials
            responding to a letter requesting that his foreskin be
            replaced. Patient relations representative DyAnn Smith
            replied that Sanford would not pay for the
            procedure.</p>

            <p>"There will be no further correspondence about this
            matter," she wrote.</p>
