            Business</h2>
            Aug 23, 8:59 am ET 

            <p>HONG KONG (Reuters) - A private hospital in Hong
            Kong is offering discount packages and fixed prices for
            some operations in a bid to attract patients during the
            territory's crushing economic downturn.</p>

            <p>"Currently, private hospitals have only six percent
            share of the market and private hospitals will need to
            come up with all sort of ways to fight for market
            share," the Union Hospital said in a statement obtained
            on Friday.</p>

            <p>Most Hong Kong residents balk at seeking treatment
            at private hospitals, which are notorious for charging
            astronomical fees that shoot far beyond original
            estimates.</p>

            <p>Under the new offer, circumcisions will be fixed at
            a price of HK$9,300 (US$1,192). Previously, they ranged
            from HK$8,660 to HK$18,050.</p>

            <p>The prices include surgery fees, consultation,
            anaesthetic fees and hospitalization. It did not
            explain why prices had varied so much previously.</p>
