            <h4>Chula doctors use scrotum parts to fix penile
            injuries</h4>

            <p>Chulalongkorn Hospital doctors have successfully
            used scrotum parts to repair wounds to male sexual
            organs.</p>

            <p>It has proven to be a cheap process too.</p>

            <p>Men with this problem can have operations to repair
            their penises under the Bt30 universal healthcare
            programme, Dr Sirichai Jindarak of the Chulalongkorn
            Hospital said yesterday.</p>

            <p>Sirichai said three or four patients came in every
            month to seek treatment for damaged penises, many
            casualties of faulty penis-enlargement techniques.</p>

            <p>They undergo surgery that takes between one hour and
            90 minutes to graft parts from the scrotal sac onto the
            penis.</p>

            <p>Because the cost of the surgery is not high, it is
            covered by the Bt30 programme.</p>

            <p>This is because it has been classified as a medical
            process to correct organ impairment, the surgeon
            said.</p>

            <p>Sirichai yesterday spoke at a seminar on male
            sexual-organ surgery at the hospital.</p>

            <p>He also revealed that Thai doctors these days could
            do very advanced sexual-organ surgery.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">His plastic-surgery division at
            Chulalongkorn Hospital has developed a new technique
            called Stage 1 to implant new foreskin by using part of
            the scrotum.</span></p>

            <p><span class="yellow">The hospital developed the
            operation from Korean techniques for restoring damaged
            foreskins he said.</span></p>

            <p>It is more effective than using arm muscles and
            other organs as was done before, he said, which could
            easily rupture, particularly from friction.</p>

            <p>Sirichai also warned men against injecting
            substances into their penises to enlarge them, which he
            said carried a high risk of cancer and deformation.</p>

            <p>A more effective and safer enlargement technique, he
            said, is where doctors instead inject liquefied fat
            from the patient.</p>
