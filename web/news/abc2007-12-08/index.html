            <h2>Call to end circumcision of baby boys</h2>

            <p>Posted Sat Dec 8, 2007 9:00am AEDT</p>

            <p><b>Tasmania's <a
            href="http://www.childcomm.tas.gov.au/"
            target="_blank">Commissioner for Children</a> has again
            called on the State Government to review laws covering
            the circumcision of baby boys for cosmetic
            reasons.</b></p>

            <p>Paul Mason says the practice is painful, inflicts
            permanent and irreversible disfigurement, and is a
            breach of human rights.</p>

            <p>He says parents do not have an unfettered right to
            do whatever they like with their children.</p>

            <p>Mr Mason says with Human Rights Day approaching, it
            is important to remember that everyone is entitled to
            equal protection under the law, regardless of their
            gender, culture or race.</p>

            <p>"If I have a religious obligation, a religious
            belief that my child should do X, Y and Z and that
            conflicts directly with a human right of the child,
            then the human right of the child will prevail," Mr
            Mason said.</p>
