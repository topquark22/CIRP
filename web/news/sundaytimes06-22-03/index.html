            <h2>New penis for youth after 'bush' disaster</h2>

            <p>A Motherwell youth is being prepared for
            reconstructive surgery after his penis was amputated
            after a botched traditional circumcision last June.</p>

            <p>The 18-year-old man, who cannot be named, left for
            Cape Town to meet a doctor about the reconstructive
            surgery. The operation will cost R30,000 and is paid
            for by donors.</p>

            <p>Doctor Mamisa Chabula, the doctor working with
            circumcision-related injuries, said she had raised the
            money from donors to help the young man undergo plastic
            reconstruction at a semi-private hospital in Cape
            Town.</p>

            <p>She said the Grade 12 pupil went to the bush last
            winter. He had complications with the wound and
            gangrene resulted. He was taken to Livingstone Hospital
            [Port Elizabeth] where it was amputated from the
            base.</p>

            <p>Chabula said after the youth came back from the
            circumcision school, he had to see a psychologist
            because of depression.</p>

            <p>He was also rejected by society for "chickening out"
            at the bush and resorting to Western medicine. He is
            currently using a urine bag.</p>

            <p>Chabula said reconstruction would also help rebuild
            the youth's self-esteem.</p>

            <p>More than 40 initiates died from botched
            circumcisions and related infections across the Eastern
            Cape last June.</p>
