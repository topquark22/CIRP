    <h2>FORESKINS: Seek Elsewhere for Infants' Urinary Tract
    Infections</h2>

    <p>New Orleans: The maligned foreskin has won a clean bill of
    health in infants' urinary tract infections.</p>

    <p>In a prospective study at St. Louis University of 52
    circumcised and 56 uncircumcised infants under six months with
    a first urinary tract infection, 72 had clinical
    pyelonephritis. Yet circumcision status (35 were circumcised)
    wasn't significant, while anatomical obstructions were.</p>

    <p>Abnormal anatomy was responsible for infections in 40
    circumcised infants and 42 uncircumcised ones, says Dr. George
    Steinhardt. Of the 26 boys with normal urinary anatomy, 12 were
    circumcised and 14 were not. Structural anomalies, evenly
    divided between groups, included 76 with reflux and 23 with
    obstructions, the team told the American Academy of Pediatrics
    meeting here. The rest had triad, valves, or bladder
    diverticula.</p>
