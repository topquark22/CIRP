            <h2>Courts Can Stop Female Circumcision of
            Immigrants</h2>

            <p><b>German courts may curtail the rights of immigrant
            parents living in the country if that may prevent their
            daughters from genital mutilation, the federal
            administrative court ruled Thursday.</b></p>

            <p>The federal administrative court in the southern
            city of Karlsruhe ruled on Thursday that a Gambian
            mother did not have the right to subject her
            six-year-old daughter to female circumcision or genital
            mutilation, rejecting the woman's appeal of a lower
            court ruling.</p>

            <p>The judges described the procedure, which typically
            involves cutting off the clitoris and other parts of
            genitalia in pre-pubescent and teenage girls, as a
            "cruel, grave form of abuse that is impossible to
            justify" and a clear violation of the welfare rights of
            the child.</p>

            <p><b>Child protection versus cultural
            tradition</b></p>

            <p>The case involved a Gambian-born woman who married a
            German man in Gambia in 2000 and brought her daughter
            from a previous relationship to Germany. The girl was
            to be sent back to the woman's extended family in
            Gambia in 2003 so that her mother could pursue a
            training course in nursing for the elderly.</p>

            <p>However, days before the girl's departure, relatives
            of the German husband alerted child welfare authorities
            that the daughter could be threatened with genital
            mutilation.</p>

            <p>The mother, who underwent female circumcision
            herself at the age of 13, had defended the ritual as a
            cultural tradition.</p>

            <p>Dresden-based social worker Matthias Hirche, who is
            working on the case pointed out on Thursday that the
            federal administrative court had categorically rejected
            the mother's stance. "The court has awarded more
            importance to the protection of the child than parents'
            rights or culture and tradition," he said.</p>

            <p><b>No travel abroad</b></p>

            <p>The girl who was placed in foster care immediately
            following an emergency ruling by local child welfare
            authorities once the matter came to light, is now back
            with her mother. Her mother is now divorced from her
            German husband.</p>

            <p>The court in Karlsruhe ruled that the girl would
            most likely be faced with genital mutilation if she was
            sent to her mother's family in Gambia. The judges said
            the fact that the girl's grandmother had been unable to
            spare her own daughter from the inhuman procedure
            raised worries that the grandmother, under the
            influence of the extended family, would be unable to
            prevent it from happening to her granddaughter.</p>

            <p>Judges in Karlsruhe also made it clear on Thursday
            that the lower court in the eastern city of Dresden
            which issued the original ruling, and the local child
            welfare office must now act to ensure the child is not
            taken out of the country where she might be threatened
            with excision.</p>

            <p>The court added that the girl could be taken from
            her mother and put in foster care again if necessary to
            protect her.</p>

            <p>State authorities have also withheld her passport.
            "We have to ensure that the girl doesn't get sent to
            Africa or to France or Britain, where genital
            mutilation is secretly practiced," said Hirche. "But to
            monitor that will still be tough," he added.</p>

            <p><b>Rampant practice</b></p>

            <p>Genital mutilation is practiced in some 28 African
            countries, despite laws that outlaw it.</p>

            <p>The court found that between 80 and 90 percent of
            woman and girls in Gambia undergo excision, known in
            some countries as female circumcision.</p>

            <p>An estimated 130 million women have been subjected
            to female circumcision and 2 million undergo the
            procedure each year, according to officials at a
            conference on female circumcision held in November 2003
            in Sweden.</p>

            <p>Excision impairs a woman's ability to enjoy sexual
            relations, and is traditionally seen as controlling
            female sexuality and improving a girl's marriage
            prospects.</p>
