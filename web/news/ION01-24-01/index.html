      <h2>Girls beat dad in court circumcision battle</h2>
      <i>January 24 2001 at 09:25AM</i>

      <p><b>Nairobi -</b> A little-publicised fight in Kenya
      against female genital mutilation registered a landmark
      victory when two girls successfully obtained a court order
      restraining their father from having them forcibly
      circumcised.</p>

      <p>Edna Jebet and Beatrice Jepkosgei achieved a first of
      sorts by taking their father to court in a move that baffled
      their Keiyo community, which views this rite of passage as a
      "must", reports the United Nations news agency, IRIN.</p>

      <p>The case came to light last December shortly before press
      reports that a school girl had died after being forcibly
      circumcised - along with eight married women - in Nandi
      District.</p>

      <p>Maendeleo ya Wanawake, the largest women's group, argues
      that men are the greatest obstacles to the elimination of
      female genital mutilation in Kenya, since many prefer their
      women circumcised.</p>

      <p>The organisation's chairperson, Zipporah Kittony, who is
      also a nominated MP, lauded the court's decision, saying that
      men derogatorily refer to uncircumcised women as "overgrown
      babies", sometimes compelling even married women to undergo
      the operation to save face.</p>

      <p>"They also claim that uncircumcised women are promiscuous
      and cannot be satisfied by one man in a marriage," she
      added.</p>

      <p>Arguments for the girls' case reminded the court that
      Kenya was a signatory to various human rights conventions,
      including the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of
      Discrimination Against Women (<a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/e1cedaw.htm">Cedaw</a>)
      and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (<a
      target="_blank"
      href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/k2crc.h">CRC</a>),
      and that there was no reason why it should violate them with
      impunity.</p>

      <p>The war against female genital mutilation had tended to
      push the practice underground until reports of "accidental"
      deaths gave new impetus to the fight to have it stopped.</p>

      <p>Circumcision is still cherished among many communities in
      Kenya, notably the Kisii, Kipsigis, Nandi, Kuria, Keiyo and
      the Marakwet.</p>

      <p>As many as 2 000 girls from the communities were
      reportedly circumcised in 2000 while 1 500 were circumcised
      the previous year.</p>

      <p>The operation, which was previously the preserve of
      traditional "surgeons," is now performed by paramedics at a
      cost of 500 Kenyan shillings (about R50).</p>

      <p>Opponents say it is a violation of human rights. They
      argue that traditional surgeons whose "patients" die should
      be charged with murder. &mdash; IRIN</p>
