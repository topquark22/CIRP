            <p>Another initiate has died in the Eastern Cape,
            bringing to 12 the number of deaths since the start of
            the winter initiation season, the provincial health
            department announced on Friday.<br />
            <br />
             "Every day we lose a life. Every day there's a death,"
            said spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo.<br />
            <br />
             He said the latest death was of a 16-year-old boy at
            an unregistered, illegal initiation school in a rural
            area between Port St Johns and Lusikisiki.<br />
            <br />
             Officials were on their way to the school to recover
            the body.</p>

            <table width="130" border="0" cellspacing="6"
            cellpadding="0" align="left" summary="">
              <tr>
                <td><b>An initiate was found dead of
                starvation</b></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Police wanted to arrest the traditional surgeon who
            ran the school. Kupelo said police and department
            officials rescued 130 boys from illegal schools in the
            mountainous Ntabankulu area of Pondoland on
            Thursday.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
             They also arrested six traditional surgeons and
            nurses.<br />
            <br />
             Police were probing charges of murder, assault, and
            running illegal schools.<br />
            <br />
             An initiate was found dead of starvation in the area
            earlier this week.<br />
            <br />
             "Some of the (Ntabankulu) initiates have been admitted
            to hospital and are being treated for malnutrition and
            pneumonia, because they were hidden in the mountains
            for three weeks," he said.<br />
            <br />
             All but one of the 12 deaths had occurred in
            Pondoland.<br />
            <br />
             "Those deaths can only be attributed to the fact that
            the custom is poorly managed in that part of the
            province.<br />
            <br />
             "It's because the custom is not theirs (the
            amaMpondo): they borrowed it from other tribes.<br />
            <br />
             "Because of that, elders are not allowed to go to the
            mountain, because some of them have not been through
            the ceremony themselves.<br />
            <br />
             "As a result it's the younger generation handling the
            whole thing."<br />
            <br />
             He said one of the surgeons already arrested in the
            area was a 24-year-old. Others had turned out to be
            members of other tribes who had been employed in
            Pondoland as domestic workers or cattle herders, and
            who now claimed to be surgeons.<br />
            <br />
             Kupelo said police would be raiding a number of
            illegal initiation schools in the Pondoland area next
            week. - Sapa</p>
