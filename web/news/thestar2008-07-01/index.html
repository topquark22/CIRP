            <h2>Circumcision: Parents to face prosecution</h2>
            <i>1 July 2008, 11:29</i> 

            <p>Eastern Cape parents who are negligent over their
            sons' circumcision will face the full might of the law,
            the <a href="http://www.ecdoh.gov.za/"
            target="_blank">provincial health department</a> warned
            on Tuesday.<br />
            <br />
             "Parents should be in the forefront of the fight
            against unnecessary deaths and complications from
            traditional circumcision," said department spokesperson
            Sizwe Kupelo.<br />
            <br />
             "Negligent parents will now be charged for
            contravening provisions of the Traditional Circumcision
            Act which regulates the custom in the province."<br />
            <br />
             His warning came as the recorded death toll in the
            current winter circumcision season in the province
            climbed to 14.<br />
            <br />
             A total of 91 other initiates were being treated in
            various hospitals, four of them facing possible genital
            amputation, he said.<br />
            <br />
             The hospitalisation was costing the province an
            average of R1 000 an initiate a day, Kupelo said.<br />
            <br />
             In addition, 535 initiates had been treated and
            discharged at Cecilia Makhiwane hospital in East
            London.<br />
            <br />
             He said the act laid down that a parent or guardian
            had to take full responsibility for an initiate, and
            had to co-operate fully with authorities in the
            interest of the initiate's health.<br />
            <br />
             Parents found guilty of contravening the act faced a
            fine of R1 000 or six months in jail.<br />
            <br />
             Hotspot areas for the current circumcision problems
            were Ntabankulu, Libode, Ngqeleni, Bizana, Mthatha and
            Port St Johns, all in the Transkei.<br />
            <br />
             Kupelo said a team of traditional leaders, police and
            department officials would visit Pondoland this week to
            raise awareness of how to curb circumcision deaths and
            complications.<br />
            <br />
             The team would also embark on "rescue operation"
            campaigns to save initiates whose health was at risk. -
