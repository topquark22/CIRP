      <h2>GP guilty of misconduct in circumcision referral</h2>

      <h3>By Mick McGann</h3>
      <b>22 August 2001</b>

      <p>A doctor who encouraged two mothers to have their baby
      sons circumcised by an insufficiently experienced surgeon was
      found guilty yesterday of serious professional
      misconduct.</p>

      <p>Dr Michael Harbinson referred the boys&mdash;one aged six
      months&mdash;to his colleague Peter Silverstone, the General
      Medical Council (<a href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/"
      target="_blank">GMC</a>) was told. Mr Silverstone failed to
      anaesthetise either boy adequately and both ended up
      screaming.</p>

      <p>Dr Harbinson, who had known Mr Silverstone for several
      years, paid him out of his GP fund-holding budget.</p>

      <p>Dr Harbinson, of Rowlands Gill, Tyne and Wear, denied the
      charge. The GMC's <a
      href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/probdocs/probdoc_frameset.htm"
      target="_blank">professional conduct committee</a> ruled that
      he could continue in practice, but subject to a condition he
      undergo retraining from his post-graduate dean for 18
      months.</p>

      <p>The committee will today consider a charge of serious
      professional misconduct against Mr Silverstone, a retired
      gynaecologist and obstetrician of Newcastle upon Tyne, who
      denies the allegation.</p>
