    <p><b>Study shows circumcised boys are prone to penis
    problems</b></p>

    <p>Of all the factors parents consider when deciding whether to
    circumcise a newborn boy, hygiene typically tops the list. But
    a surprising <a href="/library/complications/vanhowe/">new
    study</a> published in the British Journal of Urology
    challenges that notion. Not only do circumcised toddlers
    require more care, but they are far more likely to develop
    penis problems than their intact counterparts, says study
    author Robert S. Van Howe, M.D., a pediatrician at Marshfield
    Clinic in Minocqua, Wisconsin. "It's the exact opposite of what
    parents have been told to do for the last 50 years." Here's
    what Dr. Van Howe concludes:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's no medical
    reason to routinely circumcise. In fact, there may be good
    reason to leave well enough alone. Dr. Van Howe's study of 468
    boys found that 54 percent of circumcised boys under age three
    had minor penis problems, such as swellings and skin adhesions.
    Only 5 percent of their uncut brethren had such
    irritations.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retract and wash daily.
    While he recommends leaving an uncircumcised boy's penis alone
    until the child can retract his foreskin himself, Dr. Van Howe
    advises parents of circumcised infants and toddlers to retract
    any remaining skin doctors typically leave behind. In this skin
    is not drawn back and washed, adhesions can form between it and
    the head of the penis. These adhesions in turn can form scars
    and bumps. In fact, 44 percent of the circumcised kids in the
    study had penile problems that could have been prevented
    through proper hygiene.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring concerns to your
    doctor. "Any redness of irritation that lasts for more than
    three days may indicate an infections and needs medical
    treatment," says Dr. Van Howe.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since fewer than 15
    percent of the penis problems in the study were detected by
    parents, it's important to ask your doctor to give your son a
    thorough genital exam during his regular checkups.</p>
