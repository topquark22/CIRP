             Posted to the web May 28, 2003</p>

            <p>By Vision Reporter<br />
             Kampala</p>

            <p>President Yoweri Museveni on Monday received a
            special message from US President George W. Bush.</p>

            <p>The message was delivered by Bush's special envoy,
            Mr. Weldon, who is also the representative of Florida
            in the American Congress. He was accompanied by
            Congressman Webster.</p>

            <p>Weldon hailed Museveni for his contribution towards
            sensitising Ugandans about the HIV/AIDS scourge. He
            said Museveni's campaign against AIDS had dramatically
            lowered the number of people living with AIDS in
            Uganda, State House said.</p>

            <p>He said the US had earmarked money to be used in a
            number of African countries in the crusade against
            AIDS.</p>

            <p>"President Museveni told his visitor that after
            studying the main channels through which AIDS spreads,
            he designed a comprehensive strategy and embarked on a
            nation wide campaign to sensitise the public and create
            awareness over such channels.</p>

            <p>He said Ugandans were mobilised to guard against
            pre-marital sex while the medical practitioners were
            expected to ensure that only uncontaminated blood is
            used in transfusions," the state House statement
            said.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Museveni said unsafe
            traditional customs like circumcision were
            discouraged</span> and only disposable syringes
            recommended to minimise chances of the spread of
            HIV/AIDS. He said as schools are a large catchment of
            the country's population, the Government had introduced
            a system whereby school children are sensitized twice
            in a month about guarding against HIV/AIDS.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, on Sunday Museveni received a special
            message from Tanzanian leader Benjamin Mkapa.</p>

            <p>The message was delivered to Kisozi farm in Mpigi by
            Mkapa's special envoy, Mr. Jakaya Kikwete, who is also
            the Tanzanian minister of foreign affairs and
            international co-operation.</p>

            <p>State House said Museveni and Kikwete discussed
            bilateral and regional matters.</p>

            <p>They laid emphasis on the peace process in the DRC
            in light of the Cape Town Agreement signed in April
            2003 between Uganda and Rwanda," a press release issued
            after the meeting said.</p>
