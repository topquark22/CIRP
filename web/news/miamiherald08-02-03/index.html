            <h4>Procedure must be medically necessary</h4>

            <p>BY ELINOR J. BRECHER<br />
             <a
            href="mailto:ebrecher@herald.com">ebrecher@herald.com</a></p>

            <p>Correcting inaccurate information released to
            physicians and the media last month, Florida Medicaid
            officials now say that the state program covering some
            medical expenses for the poor will pay for
            circumcisions only when they are medically
            necessary.</p>

            <p>Initially, officials said that elective
            circumcisions billed as part of the delivery process
            also would be covered.</p>

            <p>Medicaid will still pay for the procedure --
            surgical removal of the foreskin -- at any time if a
            doctor deems it medically necessary, usually because of
            infection, injury or abnormality that impairs
            function.</p>

            <p>The move was part of a legislative cost-reduction
            measure designed to save the state $2.3 million. It
            took effect July 1.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">''If it is not medically
            necessary to perform a circumcision at the time of the
            newborn's delivery, that service will not be
            covered,''</span> said Jessica Cary, a spokeswoman for
            the <a href="http://www.fdhc.state.fl.us/index.shtml"
            target="_blank">Agency for Health Care
            Administration</a>.</p>

            <p>Initially, she said, Medicaid ``announced that these
            procedures would be reimbursed if performed at the time
            of delivery when the newborn was still hospitalized.
            Unfortunately, an incorrect . . . message was
            posted.''</p>

            <p>She was unable to say Friday whether Medicaid will
            pay providers for the procedure during delivery since
            July 1.</p>

            <p>Nationwide, according to the <a
            href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/">National Center for
            Health Statistics</a>, about 60 percent of baby boys
            undergo the procedure, even though The American Academy
            of Pediatrics has said that the benefits of
            circumcision were not strong enough to warrant
            recommending it as a routine procedure.</p>

            <p>Medicaid paid $106,630 for 659 procedures in
            Miami-Dade County in 2001-2001 and $122,656 for 677 in
            Broward, state Medicaid records show.</p>
