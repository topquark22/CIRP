            <h2>Scientists Discover 'Natural Barrier' to HIV</h2>

            <p><i>By E.J. Mundell</i><br />
             <i>HealthDay Reporter</i> Mon Mar 5, 2:02 PM ET</p>

            <p>MONDAY, March 5 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers have
            discovered that cells in the mucosal lining of human
            genitalia produce a protein that "eats up" invading HIV
            -- possibly keeping the spread of the AIDS more
            contained than it might otherwise be.</p>

            <p>Even more important, enhancing the activity of this
            protein, called Langerin, could be a potent new way to
            curtail the transmission of the virus that causes AIDS,
            the Dutch scientists added.</p>

            <p>Langerin is produced by Langerhans cells, which form
            a web-like network in skin and mucosa. This network is
            one of the first structures HIV confronts as it
            attempts to infect its host.</p>

            <p>However, "we observed that Langerin is able to
            scavenge viruses from the surrounding environment,
            thereby preventing infection," said lead researcher
            Teunis Geijtenbeek, an immunologist researcher at <a
            href="http://www.vumc.nl/" target="_blank">Vrije
            University Medical Center</a> in Amsterdam.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">And since generally all tissues
            on the outside of our bodies have Langerhans cells, we
            think that the human body is equipped with an antiviral
            defense mechanism, destroying incoming viruses,"</span>
            Geijtenbeek said.</p>

            <p>The <a href="/library/disease/HIV/de_witte2007/"
            target="_blank">finding</a>, reported in the March 4
            online issue of <i>Nature Medicine</i>, "is very
            interesting and unexpected," said Dr. Jeffrey Laurence,
            director of the Laboratory for AIDS Virus Research at
            the <a href="http://www.med.cornell.edu/"
            target="_blank">Weill Cornell Medical College</a>, in
            New York City. "It may explain part of the relative
            inefficiency of HIV in being transmitted."</p>

            <p>Even though HIV has killed an estimated 22 million
            people since it was first recognized more than 25 years
            ago, it is actually not very good at infecting humans,
            relatively speaking.</p>

            <p>For example, the human papillomavirus (HPV), which
            causes cervical cancer, is nearly 100 percent
            infectious, Laurence noted. That means that
            <i>every</i> encounter with the sexually transmitted
            virus will end in infection.</p>

            <p>"On the other hand, during one episode of
            penile-vaginal intercourse with an HIV-infected
            partner, the chance that you are going to get HIV is
            somewhere between one in 100 and one in 200," Laurence
            said.</p>

            <p>Experts have long puzzled why HIV is relatively
            tough to contract, compared to other pathogens. The
            Dutch study, conducted in the laboratory using
            Langerhans cells from 13 human donors, may explain
            why.</p>

            <p>When HIV comes in contact with genital mucosa, its
            ultimate target -- the cells it seeks to hijack and
            destroy -- are immune system T-cells. But T-cells are
            relatively far away (in lymph tissues), so HIV uses
            nearby Langerhans cells as "vehicles" to migrate to
            T-cells.</p>

            <p>For decades, the common wisdom was that HIV easily
            enters and infects Langerhans cells. Geijtenbeek's team
            has now cast doubt on that notion.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">Looking closely at the
            interaction of HIV and Langerhans cells, they found
            that the cells "do <i>not</i> become infected by HIV-1,
            because the cells have the protein Langerin on their
            cell surface," Geijtenbeek said. "Langerin captures
            HIV-1 very efficiently, and this Langerin-bound HIV-1
            is taken up (a bit like eating) by the Langerhans cells
            and destroyed."</span></p>

            <p>In essence, Geijtenbeek said, "Langerhans cells act
            more like a virus vacuum cleaner."</p>

            <p>Only in certain circumstances -- such as when levels
            of invading HIV are very high, or if Langerin activity
            is particularly weak -- are Langerhans cells
            overwhelmed by the virus and infected.</p>

            <p>The finding is exciting for many reasons, not the
            least of which is its potential for HIV prevention,
            Geijtenbeek said.</p>

            <p>"We are currently investigating whether we can
            enhance Langerin function by increasing the amount of
            Langerin on the cell surface of Langerhans cells," he
            said. "This might be a real possibility, but it will
            take time. I am also confident that other researchers
            will now also start exploring this possibility."</p>

            <p>The discovery might also help explain differences in
            vulnerability to HIV infection among people.</p>

            <p>"It is known that the Langerin gene is different in
            some individuals," Geijtenbeek noted. "These
            differences could affect the function of Langerin.
            Thus, Langerhans cells with a less functional Langerin
            might be more susceptible to HIV-1, and these
            individuals are more prone to infection. We are
            currently investigating this."</p>

            <p>The finding should also impact the race to find
            topical microbicides that might protect women against
            HIV infection. Choosing compounds that allow Langerin
            to continue to work its magic will enhance any
            candidate microbicide's effectiveness, the Dutch
            researcher said.</p>

            <p>Laurence did offer one note of caution, however.</p>

            <p>"In the test tube, this is a very important
            finding," he said. "But there are many things in the
            test tube that don't occur when you get into an animal
            or a human. Having said that, though, this is a very
            intriguing finding."</p>
