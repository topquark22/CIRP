            <p>The Forum - 02/08/2003</p>

            <p>After spending the greater part of four days
            listening, MeritCare attorneys took to the offensive
            Friday in the circumcision lawsuit against the
            hospital.</p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.vogellaw.com/fsl5cs/XMLAttorneyProfile.asp?guid=I1D0AB9301DD211B28BAB4D00E205CACF&amp;ind_wld_id=1286278"
             target="_blank">Jane Voglewede</a> asked <a
            href="http://www.zbaer.com/anita.htm"
            target="_blank">Anita Flatt</a> if she remembered
            signing the consent form to have her child circumcised
            March 6, 1997.</p>

            <p>"Yes," Flatt replied.</p>

            <p>She asked Flatt whether she was "mentally clear"
            when she read it.</p>

            <p>She was.</p>

            <p>Voglewede then asked if she remembered reading the
            following line:</p>

            <p>"My doctor, dentist, or podiatrist has explained the
            nature and purpose of the surgery or procedure(s),
            other methods or treatment, risk involved and the
            possibility of complications; I understand these risks
            and options available to me. I understand there is no
            guarantee as to the results that may be obtained."</p>

            <p>Flatt said she had.</p>

            <p>Flatt of <a href="http://www.hawley.govoffice.com/"
            target="_blank">Hawley</a>, Minn., is suing <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734"
             target="_blank">Dr. Sunita Kantak</a> and <a
            href="http://www.ci.fargo.nd.us/visitor.htm"
            target="_blank">Fargo</a>-based <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/"
            target="_blank">MeritCare Hospital</a> claiming she and
            her husband, James, weren't told complete and accurate
            information about removing the foreskin from their
            son's penis.</p>

            <p>She has told the jury she did not receive any
            information prior to her son's birth about the risks
            and benefits of circumcision.</p>

            <p>She says she never received the booklet MeritCare
            gives out to parents, and only talked to Kantak briefly
            about the pain involved before the procedure was
            performed.</p>

            <p>Had Flatt understood the risks involved in the
            procedure, she wouldn't have had it done, she said.</p>

            <p>MeritCare nurses and doctors haven't had the chance
            to testify on whether they recall giving the
            information to Flatt.</p>

            <p>Voglewede also asked Flatt about her conversation
            with Kantak on March 7, the day of the
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>She asked Flatt if Kantak had "pushed" her to have
            the procedure done.</p>

            <p>She hadn't, Flatt said.</p>

            <p>Flatt asked Kantak about the pain involved during
            the procedure and was told an anesthetic would be
            applied. The conversation ended shortly after.</p>

            <p>"At the time you felt all the questions you had were
            answered?" Voglewede asked.</p>

            <p>"Yes," Flatt responded.</p>

            <p>Voglewede asked Flatt if there is any expert
            testimony to indicate something is wrong with her son's
            penis.</p>

            <p>Flatt explained that her son has been diagnosed with
            an "asymmetrical circumcision," which essentially means
            one side of the penis head has more skin than the
            other.</p>

            <p>Flatt was concerned whether the diagnosis would
            cause complications with his sexual function, fertility
            and urination.</p>

            <p>But medical experts have stated that is not a
            concern, the jury was told Friday.</p>

            <p>Experts also said there is a good chance the
            asymmetry would be unnoticeable by the time Flatt's son
            hits puberty.</p>

            <p>During attorney <a
            href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a>'s examination of Flatt,
            he asked his client to describe what she thought
            circumcision was at the time of her son's birth.</p>

            <p>"You just cut around," she said. "I knew the term
            meant cut around."</p>

            <p>Flatt, an attorney at Baer's law firm, said she was
            told by the nurse, "it was a really quick
            procedure."</p>

            <p>She told Baer she tried to ask the nurse questions
            about the procedure on March 6, but was told she would
            have to wait to ask the doctor in the morning.</p>

            <p>Jurors saw more than an hour worth of Flatt's home
            video tape of the birth.</p>

            <p>It showed the commotion of people visiting the baby
            much of March 6 and March 7.</p>

            <p>"What I think is the key to that video is that she
            has documented actual visual footage of the proceeding
            of what went on March 6," Baer said following the
            trial's adjournment for the day. "None of that included
            a visit with Doctor Kantak."</p>

            <p>Jurors also Friday were read the written deposition
            of James Flatt, who died since the lawsuit was
            filed.</p>

            <p>He said he was horrified the first time he saw his
            son's penis after the circumcision and described it as
            a bloody stump.</p>

            <p>When asked what he would have liked to have been
            told before the procedure, he said "that he could die
            from it."</p>

            <p>Flatt is asking for an unspecified amount in
            damages.</p>

            <p>MeritCare officials left the courtroom without
            comment.</p>

            <p>The trial is expected to end next week. <a

            presiding over the case.</p>
