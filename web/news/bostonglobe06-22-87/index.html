            <p>Article Text:</p>

            <p>Circumcision is the first surgery most American boys
            encounter. But the reason for doing it isn't usually
            medical; it's more likely a matter of habit, style or
            religion.</p>

            <p>For years, the <a href="http://www.aap.org/"
            target="_blank">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> and
            <a href="http://www.acog.org/" target="_blank">American
            College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a> have
            said routine circumcision of newborn boys isn't
            medically warranted. As a result, the procedure now
            isn't covered routinely by many insurance plans,
            including Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
            Massachusetts.</p>

            <p>While most newborn American boys still are
            circumcised, the number seems to be dropping. According
            to the National Center for Health Statistics, 59
            percent of newborn boys, or 1,163,000 babies, were
            circumcised in 1985. The center doesn't have statistics
            for previous years, but specialists say the number has
            fallen significantly compared to 10 or 20 years ago; 20
            years ago, they say, circumcision of newborns was
            routine.</p>

            <p>In Boston, specialists say the numbers have
            declined, too. At <a
            href="http://www.brighamandwomens.org/default.asp"
            target="_blank">Brigham and Women's Hospital</a>, the
            largest maternity service in the state (expecting close
            to 10,000 babies this year) 58 percent of boys born in
            1986 were circumcised. At Beth Israel Hospital, second
            largest with 5,000 deliveries expected this year,
            roughly 70-80 percent of boys are circumcised.</p>

            <p>Most circumcisions involve strapping the baby onto a
            board and inserting a bell-shaped plastic or metal
            device between the foreskin and the head of the penis.
            The foreskin is clamped against the bell and cut off
            with a scalpel. Usually, there is a little bleeding,
            and the wound heals in a week to 10 days. In some
            states, pediatricians do circumcisions; in
            Massachusetts and most other states, it's usually done
            by the obstetrician in the first three days of the
            baby's life.</p>

            <p>Anesthesia seldom is used. General anesthesics are
            considered too risky for such a minor operation,
            although they're used if circumcision is done at a
            later age. Local anesthesics, sometimes used, may not
            work and carry some risk. Numbing sprays or creams
            don't penetrate far enough.</p>

            <p>How painful is circumcision? Doctors say it seems to
            vary; some babies scream for 10 minutes, others cry but
            can be quieted easily, says Dr. William D. Cochran of
            the Joint Program in Neonatology at <a
            href="http://www.brighamandwomens.org/default.asp"
            target="_blank">Brigham and Women's</a>, <a
            href="http://www.bidmc.harvard.edu/"
            target="_blank">Beth Israel</a> and <a
            href="http://web1.tch.harvard.edu/"
            target="_blank">Children's</a> hospitals. Few babies
            appear to be in pain half an hour later.</p>

            <p>Even if the pain isn't long-lasting, why perform any
            surgery without a good medical reason? Jewish and
            Moslem babies are circumcised for religious reasons;
            Jews to signify the covenant between God and the Jewish
            people, Moslems because it was instructed by
            Mohammed.</p>

            <p>For decades, most non-Moslem, non-Jewish Americans
            chose circumcision out of custom or because of
            arguments that it improves hygiene, discourages
            masturbation or reduces the chance of cancer of the
            penis, or in sexual partners, cancer of the cervix.
            These arguments now are widely discarded. In a few
            cases, boys who don't get circumcised at birth need to
            be circumcised later for medical reasons; the surgery
            is more complicated and seemingly more painful
            then.</p>

            <p>The prime reason for infant circumcision today,
            though, doctors say, is that parents want their sons to
            look like their father and like other boys. And,
            doctors say, since "everyone" seems to choose
            circumcision, it's easiest just to go along.</p>

            <p>"I think it's something that feeds on itself.
            Parents tell me when I try to talk them out of it that
            they don't want their child to look different in the
            locker room," says Dr. Ronald L. Poland, professor of
            pediatrics at <a href="http://www.med.wayne.edu/"
            target="_blank">Wayne State University School of
            Medicine</a>. Poland is chairman of an <span
            class="yellow">American Academy of Pediatrics committee
            that recently reaffirmed the academy's stand against
            routine circumcision.</span> As more and more boys go
            without circumcision, the "locker room" argument may
            fade.</p>

            <p>In the last two years, however, one new contention
            in favor of circumcision has surfaced. Studies
            published in 1985 and 1986 in the journal
            <i>Pediatrics</i> showed an increased risk of urinary
            tract infections in babies who weren't circumcised.
            These infections, which occur in about 4 percent of
            uncircumcised boys, usually aren't dangerous, but
            occasionally cause serious kidney damage, says Dr.
            Thomas E. Wiswell, chief of the newborn service at <a
            href="http://www.bamc.amedd.army.mil/"
            target="_blank">Brooke Army Medical Center</a> in San
            Antonio and author of the studies. He says his research
            shows that circumcised boys have only one-tenth to
            one-twentieth the rate of infections.</p>

            <p>This connection hasn't been proven to the
            satisfaction of Poland's committee and many other
            specialists, but they agree the data are
            provocative.</p>

            <p>Wiswell says that even if the connection is proved,
            he's not sure that means all boys should be
            circumcised.</p>

            <p>"Right now, I'm sort of in a quandary," he says. For
            years, Wiswell argued against routine, non-religious
            circumcision. "I felt as most people did that there
            were really no medical indications," he says. <span
            class="yellow">"Right now, I can't say that. I know of
            a valid medical reason, and the strongest statement I
            say right now is that every single parent who's
            considering the procedure has to be aware of the pros
            and cons. . .I frankly consider circumcision a barbaric
            kind of procedure because we do it without anesthesia.
            Is it worth it? I don't know."</span></p>

            <p>The rate of complications following circumcision,
            usually infection, bleeding or removal or too much or
            too little tissue, is less than 2 percent, Wiswell
            says; his own study showed a complication rate of less
            than half a percent. But with so many circumcisions
            done each year, even a tiny complication rate means
            that children are harmed each year by the surgery.</p>

            <p>In addition to cultural values and the desire to fit
            in, circumcision evokes another
            consideration&mdash;money.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">I have some good friends who
            are obstetricians outside the military, and they look
            at a foreskin and almost see a $125 price tag on it,"
            says Wiswell. "Each one is that much money. Heck, if
            you do 10 a week, that's over $1,000 a week, and they
            don't take that much time."</span></p>

            <p>For Jewish and Moslem couples, the decision often is
            not whether to circumcise their sons, but whether it
            should be done in a hospital operation or a religious
            ceremony. The options for Jewish families have just
            expanded. Earlier this month, 11 Boston-area physicians
            became certified mohelim, ritual circumcisers, after
            completing training through the Reform Jewish
            movement.</p>

            <p>Whichever choice you make as parents, you should be
            sure your son's genitals, circumcised or not, get the
            proper care, mainly just washing. Penises don't need
            special hygiene; if the baby isn't circumcised, parents
            are advised to leave the foreskin alone and not
            forcibly retract it to clean underneath. In a few
            years, the foreskin probably will loosen on its own and
            be retractable for cleaning underneath. It also may be
            reassuring to know that newborns have particularly
            tight-looking foreskins; their penises will look more
            like grown men's later.</p>

            <p>Parents would do well to be on the lookout for signs
            of urinary infection, whether or not their child is
            circumcised, and call a doctor if symptoms, including
            fever, unusually bad-smelling urine, vomiting or
            diarrhea, appear.</p>
