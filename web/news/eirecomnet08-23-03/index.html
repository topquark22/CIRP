            <h2>Surgeon calls for ban on hospital
            circumcisions</h2>
            From:ireland.com Saturday, 23rd August, 2003 

            <p>A Dublin surgeon and male circumcision expert has
            said that the procedure should be banned in Irish
            hospitals.</p>

            <p>Describing the procedure as "a mutilation", Dr Matt
            McHugh said he believed circumcision had no medical
            justification and exposed patients to various risks. He
            believed circumcision should "be banned" from all Irish
            hospitals, despite the cultural requirements of ethnic
            minorities.</p>

            <p>Dr McHugh wrote an influential paper in 1981 in the
            <a href="http://www.imj.ie/index.php"
            target="_blank">Irish Medical Journal</a>, advising
            against the procedure.</p>

            <p>Circumcision has previously been carried out for
            medical purposes to address phimosis, a tightening of
            the foreskin. However, according to Dr McHugh, a
            "simple dorsal slit" in the foreskin is sufficient to
            cure the problem.</p>

            <p>"What I'm saying here and now is that circumcision
            is a procedure that should never be performed," he
            said. "Basically, circumcision can be a dangerous
            procedure, it can have complications," he said. "It
            involves a general anaesthetic.</p>

            <p>It's disfiguring and basically you're removing
            something that shouldn't be removed." The end of the
            penis "is exposed to all sorts of trauma", according to
            Dr McHugh. "The foreskin is not useless, it has a
            function, and the function is to protect the glans of
            the penis."</p>

            <p>He said he believed cultural reasons, such as in
            those in the Jewish and Islamic faiths where infant
            boys are circumcised, were not sufficient.</p>

            <p>"I am a medical man, I am not a religious expert,
            but I find it absolutely incredible circumcision can be
            initiated for some obscure religious belief." He said
            he would never perform the procedure for non-medical
            reasons. "That's out of the question. I think most of
            my colleagues wouldn't either."</p>

            <p>He said he agreed with the current policy in place
            in the south-east region, where hospitals refuse to
            carry out the procedure.</p>

            <p>"Certainly I am not going to do it, I don't care
            what they want. I'm not going to mutilate any children.
            If they come to this country they should be educated
            about the medical complications associated with
            circumcision. I feel it is unacceptable that this
            procedure be carried out for any reason, including
            religious belief."</p>

            <p>Dr McHugh's comments contrast with a 2001 report on
            pregnancy services for asylum-seekers and refugees. The
            report, commissioned by the <a
            href="http://www.erha.ie/" target="_blank">Eastern
            Regional Health Authority</a>, recommended a review of
            policy in relation to circumcision at maternity
            hospitals.</p>

            <p>According to one of the authors of the study, <a
            href="http://www.tcd.ie/Womens_Studies/jomurphylawless.htm"
             target="_blank">Dr Jo Murphy Lawless</a> of the
            Department of Social Policy in <a
            href="http://www.ucd.ie/">UCD</a>, research carried out
            for the study found access to the procedure to be one
            of the areas of concern for many women from ethnic
            minorities.</p>

            <p>"We got a strong sense on the ground that there is a
            demand for it and we needed to put it in place. It was
            a demand that clearly had to be responded to."</p>

            <p>According to Dr Murphy Lawless, there has been no
            significant change in policy towards circumcision in
            Irish maternity hospitals. In its ethical <a
            href="/library/statements/bma2003/">guidelines</a> on
            male circumcision, the British Medical Association said
            it had no policy on the medical benefits or risks
            associated with non-medical male circumcision.</p>
