      <h3>Ouch! Boys Lose Too Much in Circumcision Slip</h3>
      <i>Updated 3:22 PM ET June 9, 2000</i> 

      <p>ANKARA (Reuters) - Health workers carrying out a mass
      circumcision on more than 200 children in western Turkey cut
      off more than they should have when they got to the last two
      on Friday.</p>

      <p>"Whether it was because of their anatomy or through
      carelessness, too much was cut off," Anatolian news agency
      quoted Manisa health service chief Ismet Nardal as
      saying.</p>

      <p>Doctors in the hospital where the two-day circumcision
      marathon was carried out immediately operated on the pair to
      try to rectify the error.</p>

      <p>"The children's stitched organs have held, the operation
      was successful," Nardal said. "They appear to be alright, but
      it will only become apparent later if they have lost their
      sexual function."</p>

      <p>Young boys are circumcised in overwhelmingly Muslim Turkey
      before they reach puberty, according to Islamic
      tradition.</p>
