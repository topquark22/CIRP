            <h2>Eritrean youth debate female circumcision in
            dramatic fashion</h2>

            <p>ADI MUSA, Eritrea (AFP) - At the end of a dirt track
            around a stage on the village square here outside
            Asmara, about 100 Eritreans impatiently await a public
            performance about a once taboo subject.</p>

            <p>The crowd, which includes many young children,
            bristles with anticipation as actors from the <a
            href="http://www.coeicl.de/nueys/"
            target="_blank">National Union of Eritrean Youth and
            Students</a> appear on the dias for a play that aims to
            promote debate over the controversial practice of
            female genital mutilation (FGM).</p>

            <p>In a country where government statistics show that
            as of 2002, 89 percent of women have been circumcised,
            reactions are palpable as the performance -- a comedy
            that tells the story of a young married couple with an
            infant daughter -- begins.</p>

            <p>The audience erupts in giggles frequently as the
            actors, using a script they themselves wrote, go
            through the familiar trials and tribulations of early
            parenthood.</p>

            <p>But when the moment of truth arrives, the crowd
            becomes serious. Should the the parents circumcise
            their daughter or not? The students pose the question
            to the crowd.</p>

            <p>Immediately a man cries out: "If the girls are not
            circumcised, they always want to go out with boys!"</p>

            <p>"No!" a woman retorts, "FGM is not good, the girls
            lose a lot of blood!"</p>

            <p>An elderly woman, draped in a traditional white
            shawl, said "culture must not change, we have received
            it from our fathers, and from our fathers' fathers. If
            it's wrong, why did they do it?"</p>

            <p>Female circumcision, which continues to be performed
            widely despite an international outcry and laws against
            it in many countries, can range from the stitching up
            of young girls' vaginas to the excision of the
            clitoris.</p>

            <p>On stage in Adi Musa, the student actors explain the
            dangers of the practice: that the baby can die during
            the operation and that circumcised women suffer during
            sexual relations.</p>

            <p>This launches another round of rousing responses
            from the audience most of whom are intimately familiar
            with the practice which although opposed by the
            Eritrean government is widely done by women in their
            homes in both Muslim and Christian communities.</p>

            <p>The play project, which started a month ago, is
            funded by the British embassy in Asmara and is the
            brainchild of Helen Bowen, a Briton who works for the
            <a href="http://www.vso.org.uk/"
            target="_blank">Voluntary Service Overseas</a>.</p>

            <p>"I wanted a project which presented it in an
            attractive way," she said. "I wanted people to be
            relaxed to talk about this."</p>

            <p>Here, Bowen appears to have achieved her goal: the
            play clearly sparked animated discussion with the
            elderly tending to defend FGM and younger people
            rejecting it.</p>

            <p>Although after the debate it is unclear whether
            minds have been changed, it is certain the play has
            provoked excited, if not always thoughtful,
            argument.</p>

            <p>Genet Tesfagergica, 50, dismisses the cautionary
            tale told on stage, informing a reporter that all three
            of her three daughters have been circumcised.</p>

            <p>"It's cultural," she says. "I did it at home,
            nothing happened, it's not dangerous."</p>

            <p>But Sirak Gebremichael, a 20-year-old man, disputes
            this reasoning.</p>

            <p>"You say it's cultural, but you accept some modern
            things by abandoning some parts of the ancient culture,
            so why don't you stop FGM also," he says.</p>

            <p>"If I have a daughter, I won't get her circumcised,"
            Sirak says. "I'm not angry against those who do it, but
            I want to tell them it's bad.</p>

            <p>"I think one day in Eritrea, ideas will evolve and
            there will be no more FGM."</p>
