            Traditional Circumcisors</h2>

            <p>Police have been directed to arrest traditional
            surgeons found forcibly circumcising men.</p>

            <p>Butere-Mumias District Commissioner Ernest Munyi
            issued the directive following the forced public
            circumcision of three elderly men, among them a senior
            Mumias Sugar Company employee, in the district.</p>

            <p>The administrator said it was wrong for any group to
            force others into their traditional practices.</p>

            <p>"All people have a right to their tradition and
            should not be forced into what they do not want."</p>

            <p>Mumias police said they were looking for the people
            who forcibly circumcised the three men.</p>

            <p>However, a number of traditional circumcisers
            insisted that they would continue targeting
            uncircumcised men during the current circumcision
            season in most parts of western Kenya, saying their
            tradition demanded that all men be circumcised.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, a man who was forcibly circumcised at
            Mayoni trading centre and later dumped bleeding by the
            roadside has instructed a lawyer to take up the matter
            and sue his attackers.</p>
