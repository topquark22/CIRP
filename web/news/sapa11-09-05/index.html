            <h2>First arrest of circumcision season</h2>

            <p>Wed, 09 Nov 2005</p>

            <p>A young man has been arrested for illegally
            circumcising two teenagers at Mdantsane in the Eastern
            Cape, provincial health spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said
            on Tuesday.</p>

            <p>He said the man, arrested at the weekend, would also
            be charged with running an unauthorised initiation
            school.</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">The boys, aged 15 and 16, had
            been admitted to Celia Makiwane Hospital.</span></p>

            <p>Kupelo said the arrest was the first of the summer
            circumcision season in the province.</p>

            <p>He said health MEC Monwabisi Goqwana met provincial
            police commissioner Sipho Mpongoma last week to urge
            that people arrested on circumcision charges be held in
            custody at least until the end of the season, so they
            could not perform more operations.</p>

            <p>The matter would also be taken up with the
            department of justice.</p>

            <p>This was part of the department's "no-nonsense"
            approach to the issue, Kupelo said.</p>

            <p>He said chiefs delegated by the province's House of
            Traditional Leaders, plus department officials and
            police representatives, held a series of imbizos on
            circumcision at different venues in the Libode area
            east of Mthatha on Tuesday.</p>

            <p>The public meetings were part of the department's
            programme to educate communities on the need for safe
            and legal circumcision.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said feedback was that community attendance
            and response were "very encouraging", and he hoped this
            meant the department was winning the circumcision
            war.</p>

            <p>About half the <span class="yellow">23 deaths</span>
            in the 2005 winter circumcision season were in the
            Libode area.</p>
