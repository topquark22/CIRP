      <h2>Congress Bans Genital Rite</h2>
      <b>By CELIA W. DUGGER</b> 

      <p>Congress outlawed the rite of female genital cutting in
      the United States just before it recessed two weeks ago.</p>

      <p>It directed federal authorities to inform new immigrants
      from countries where it is commonly practiced that parents
      who arrange for their children to be cut here, as well as
      people who perform the cutting, face up to five years in
      prison.</p>

      <p>The new <a
      href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/ts_search.pl?title=18&amp;sec=116"
      target="_blank">law</a> also requires United States
      representatives to the World Bank and other international
      financial institutions that have lent billions of dollars to
      the 28 African countries where the practice exists to oppose
      loans to governments that have not carried out educational
      programs to prevent it.</p>

      <p>Support for these measures -- included in an
      end-of-session spending bill -- built this year as the case
      of Fauziya Kassindja, a young woman who fled Togo to avoid
      having her genitals cut off and sought asylum here, gained
      attention in the American media, government officials
      said.</p>

      <p>"You keep trying to explain that this is not
      circumcision," said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., who
      along with Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., has repeatedly introduced
      bills in past sessions to outlaw the practice. "This is more
      like Lorena Bobbit. Once they really find out it goes on and
      is not some victim fantasy we're having, they're
      horrified."</p>

      <p>Experts say there is no way to measure how many girls are
      being genitally cut in the United States since the rite is
      usually performed privately.</p>

      <p>But the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/"
      target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention</a> recently estimated that more than 150,000
      women and girls of African origin or ancestry in the United
      States may be at risk of the rite or have already been cut.
      Researchers developed these rough estimates by matching 1990
      <a href="http://www.census.gov/" target="_blank">Census
      Bureau</a> population data on the number of girls and women
      whose families came from the African countries where the
      practice is customary with estimates of the prevalence of the
      rite in those countries.</p>

      <p>New York and Newark, N.J., as well as Los Angeles and
      Washington, are among the metropolitan areas where the
      largest number of these at-risk girls and women live,
      according to the estimates.</p>

      <p>The data was gathered in response to an April directive
      from Congress. At that time, Congress also told federal
      health officials to develop a program to educate immigrants
      about the dangers of the practice, which they are now
      doing.</p>

      <p>The federal ban on genital cutting, which takes effect six
      months after the law's passage on Sept. 30, comes when states
      and health workers are increasingly debating how to respond
      to a cultural practice that is a highly valued rite of
      passage among some African immigrants, but is abhorred by
      many Americans.</p>

      <p>California, Minnesota, Tennessee, Rhode Island and North
      Dakota are among the states that have outlawed the practice
      in the past two years, congressional researchers say.</p>

      <p>A group of physicians at the the <a
      href="http://www.washington.edu/medical/hmc/"
      target="_blank">Harborview Medical Center</a>, a public
      hospital in Seattle, have taken a different view. After
      Somali mothers repeatedly requested that their daughters be
      genitally cut in the hospital, the doctors proposed what they
      considered a largely symbolic form of the ritual: nicking the
      tip of a girl's clitoris, with her consent, under a local
      anesthetic. No tissue would be removed, they said. The
      proposal has stirred an emotionally charged debate there.</p>

      <p>"I think that this is an issue that should be decided by a
      physician, the family and the child," Abraham Bergman, chief
      of pediatrics at the hospital, said. "Privacy should prevail
      and the brouhaha is inappropriate."</p>

      <p>It is not clear whether the procedure being proposed in
      Seattle would violate the new law against what Congress
      termed "female genital mutilation," government officials
      said.</p>

      <p>The Federal <a
      href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/ts_search.pl?title=18&amp;sec=116"
      target="_blank">law</a> provides for the prosecution of
      anyone who "circumcises, excises, or infibulates the whole or
      any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of
      another person who has not attained the age of 18."
      Infibulation involves stitching together the labia to largely
      cover the vagina.</p>

      <p>Members of Congress say they believe the United States
      needs to send a forceful, clear message to immigrants here
      that female genital cutting is a practice they must
      abandon.</p>

      <p>They say the United States should follow the example of
      the French, who over the past 10 to 15 years have criminally
      prosecuted parents in more than 30 families from Mali,
      Mauritania, the Gambia and Senegal for the excision of
      daughters. Such cases are usually reported to the police by
      doctors, who detect the practice while examining the girls.
      Usually, the convicted parents have been given suspended
      sentences, though occasionally they get prison time.</p>

      <p>"At first the doctors hesitated, saying, 'We cannot betray
      families,"' said Linda Weil-Curiel, a lawyer who is France's
      leading crusader against the practice. "I said, 'Your first
      obligation is to the child. If you do not report a family
      when you notice they practice excision, then the next child
      born will be excised, too. You bear the responsibility."'</p>

      <p>The congressional push to outlaw genital cutting in the
      United States was led by a handful of senators and
      representatives. Reid, the point man in the Senate, said he
      first lost sleep over this issue in 1994 after CNN broadcast
      a video of a 10-year-old Egyptian girl being cut.</p>

      <p>"They grab her and hold her down and rip out her genitalia
      with a razor blade," Reid said, adding that he thought at the
      time of his two young granddaughters.</p>

      <p>"I said, 'What am I going to do about this?' All my staff
      advised me to stay away from it. You have to be careful on
      issues like this. Is this something a man should be involved
      in? The first time I talked about it on the floor, I felt
      very uncomfortable. You're talking about a little girl's
      vagina."</p>

      <p>Representative Schroeder, who is retiring from the House
      of Representatives this year, has been working on the issue
      for more than 20 years.</p>

      <p>Both said in recent years that they have been unable to
      get a ban through Congress. They said some members simply
      could not believe that the practice actually goes on. And
      some were worried that it would lead to proposals to abolish
      male circumcision.</p>

      <p>This year, they said, their years of pestering their
      fellow members, combined with greater press attention to the
      issue, including a series of articles in The New York Times,
      and the Republican-controlled Congress's desire to counter
      the tendency of female voters to support Democrats, led to
      passage of the law.</p>

      <p>A separate measure to pressure African governments to take
      action in their own countries had another important ally in
      the Senate, Patrick Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the
      foreign operations subcommittee of the Appropriations
      Committee.</p>

      <p>The provision, which takes effect a year from now, made
      United States support for loans from international financial
      institutions dependent on foreign governments carrying out
      educational campaigns against genital cutting. It charges the
      secretary of the treasury with deciding whether U.S.
      representatives to the lending institutions will oppose or
      support loans and grants to countries.</p>

      <p>"Some in the World Bank bureaucracy have always taken the
      position that if the United States suggests another country
      do something differently, the client countries will react
      against it," Leahy said.</p>

      <p>"In fact, it is through this kind of pressure that we've
      had changes necessary in a number of countries, ranging from
      privatization in the former Soviet Union to female education
      in developing countries. This requires diplomacy on the part
      of the international financial institution, but they have a
      lot of people paid a great deal of money to practice that
      diplomacy."</p>

      <p>Officials in such financial institutions as the World Bank
      and the <a href="http://www.imf.org/"
      target="_blank">International Monetary Fund</a> say that the
      success of the new American strategy will depend on how
      diplomatically it is carried out.</p>

      <p>"If it highlights the problem, it will be constructive,"
      said Eric Chinje, external affairs officer for Africa at the
      <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/" target="_blank">World
      Bank</a>. "If it provides an instrument for fingerpointing,
      it will be counterproductive."</p>
