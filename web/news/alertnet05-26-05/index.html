            abuse</h2>

            <p>26 May 2005 15:15:34 GMT<br />
            Source: Reuters</p>

            <p>JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (Reuters) - South African
            police and traditional leaders say they will crack down
            on kidnappings, assaults and other abuses in
            circumcision schools during the next winter initiation
            season.</p>

            <p>Every year thousands of youths leave their parents
            to spend days or weeks in the care of traditional
            leaders at an initiation school where they are
            circumcised, a rite of passage commonly referred to as
            "going to the mountain."</p>

            <p>Besides the injuries suffered by a minority every
            year through botched operations, others were forced to
            go against their will or were taken away to secret
            locations without their parents' knowledge or consent,
            police said on Thursday.</p>

            <p>"It is quite traumatic for a parent not knowing
            where a child is. These schools happen in winter time
            when conditions are very harsh," Gauteng Province
            Assistant Police Commissioner Colin Hendricks told
            reporters.</p>

            <p>Police in Gauteng, which includes Johannesburg,
            Pretoria and Soweto, were working with the Congress of
            Traditional Leaders of South Africa (Contralesa) to
            monitor initiation activities and prosecute anyone
            found to be acting illegally.</p>

            <p>"The end result is that more boys will be safe," he
            said.</p>

            <p>Contralesa said it wanted to impose a minimum age of
            18 for boys to enter circumcision school.</p>

            <p>"It is quite clear that there are people who are
            hell-bent on making financial gains out of this
            cultural practice, who charge exorbitant prices to
            circumcise an initiate and leave them with no
            guidance," Manene Tabane, provincial Contralesa
            secretary, told a joint news conference with the
            police.</p>

            <p>"They kidnap these minors and they are demanding an
            exorbitant price upon releasing the boy."</p>

            <p>More than 6,000 boys in Eastern Cape Province, where
            circumcision is most prevalent, have been admitted to
            hospital since 1995. More than 30 died and and 70
            needed to have their genitals amputated after
            circumcision-related complications or infections, an
            Eastern Cape official said earlier this year.</p>
