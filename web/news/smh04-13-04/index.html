            <h2>Circumcision myths</h2>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.presscouncil.org.au/"
            target="_blank">Australian Press Council</a> has
            dismissed a complaint by Professor Brian Morris against
            the Good Weekend magazine, published by The Sydney
            Morning Herald, over a <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/smh01-10-04/">column</a>
            by Dr Karl Kruszelnicki. Professor Morris's complaint
            centred on a regular short column, Mythconceptions, in
            which Dr Kruszelnicki writes about 400 words on many
            different subjects which fall into the category of
            ``life's myths, curiosities and absurdities.''</p>

            <p>In particular, Professor Morris complained about a
            column on circumcision, <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/smh01-10-04/">May the
            foreskin be with you</a>, published on January 7, 2004,
            describing it as ``a mischievous anti-circumcision
            article'' and ``blatantly biased propaganda.''</p>

            <p>He said Dr Kruszelnicki was ``deliberately
            deceptive'' in not mentioning any of the health
            benefits of circumcision and criticised one of Dr
            Kruszelnicki's sources as an ``anti-circ activist'' and
            a ``hero of the anti movement'' who did not have
            appropriate medical qualifications.</p>

            <p>In response, Dr Kruszelnicki, who acknowledged that
            he is not a urologist, pointed out that his column did
            not set out to discuss in detail the pros and cons of
            circumcision but rather discussed specifically what he
            saw as ``the myth'' that circumcision was originally
            performed for hygiene reasons and how this belief later
            evolved.</p>

            <p>Dr Kruszelnicki named four sources, including the
            one objected to by Professor Morris.</p>

            <p>In relation to the latter, Dr Kruszelnicki pointed
            out he quoted just eight words from that source: the
            foreskin is ``a uniquely specialised, sensitive,
            functional organ of touch".</p>

            <p>The Press Council noted that Good Weekend offered
            Professor Morris an opportunity to air his views by
            publishing his letter to the editor on January 31.</p>

            <p>However, Professor Morris also believed that Good
            Weekend magazine, in later publishing three letters
            opposing the views in his letter, demonstrated
            editorial bias.</p>

            <p>Given the nature of the Mythconceptions column and
            the fact that Good Weekend published Professor Morris's
            letter, the Press Council said it believed the
            publication had adequately dealt with the matter.</p>
