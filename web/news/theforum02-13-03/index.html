            <p>By Jeff Baird<br />
            jbaird@forumcomm.com</p>

            <p>The Forum - 02/13/2003</p>

            <p>Attorney <a href="http://www.zbaer.com/zenas.htm"
            target="_blank">Zenas Baer</a> questioned <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=734"
             target="_blank">Dr. Sunita Kantak</a> Wednesday about
            what the doctor discloses to parents about
            circumcision.</p>

            <p>Baer asked Kantak if she agreed with the American
            Academy of Pediatrics' method of obtaining <a
            href="/library/ethics/AAP/">informed consent</a> in
            which all known risks are disclosed to parents.</p>

            <p>Kantak said she did.</p>

            <p>Baer then listed several potential, albeit rare,
            circumcision complications, stopping after each one to
            ask Kantak if she mentioned it to parents.</p>

            <p>Kantak didn't mention many of the specific risks on
            Baer's list, including inclusion cists, concealed penis
            and skin bridges, because, she said, they wouldn't mean
            anything to most parents.</p>

            <p>Kantak said she talks about the risk of bleeding,
            infection and trauma.</p>

            <p>If the parents have more concerns, she talks about
            specific risks, including those on Baer's list, she
            said.</p>

            <p>"If they want to know more, I tell them," Kantak
            said.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.zbaer.com/anita.htm"
            target="_blank">Anita Flatt</a> of <a
            href="http://www.hawley.govoffice.com/"
            target="_blank">Hawley</a>, Minn., is suing Kantak and
            <a href="http://www.ci.fargo.nd.us/default.asp"
            target="_blank">Fargo</a>-based <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/">MeritCare Hospital</a>
            in <a href="http://www.co.cass.nd.us/"
            target="_blank">Cass County</a> District Court,
            claiming she and her husband, James, weren't told
            complete and accurate information about removing the
            foreskin from their son's penis.</p>

            <p>She has told the jury she did not receive
            information prior to her son's birth about the risks
            and benefits of circumcision.</p>

            <p>She says she never received the booklet about the
            procedure MeritCare gives to parents, and only talked
            to Kantak briefly about the <a
            href="/library/pain/">pain</a> involved before the
            procedure was performed.</p>

            <p>Had Flatt understood the <a
            href="/library/complications/">risks</a> involved in
            the <a href="/library/procedure/gomco/">procedure</a>,
            she wouldn't have had it done.</p>

            <p>Baer, who will continue questioning Kantak today,
            spent much of the afternoon requesting the doctor give
            a detailed description of how a circumcision is
            performed.</p>

            <p>He used words like ripping, tearing, crushing and
            cutting when questioning Kantak.</p>

            <p>Kantak said the procedure involves removing the
            foreskin from the penis.</p>

            <p>"I don't know whether I would call it, 'Crush,'"
            Kantak replied. "You can."</p>

            <p>Baer also tried to establish that, even with an
            anesthetic, the infant experiences pain.</p>

            <p>Kantak, who estimated she has performed more than
            400 circumcisions, said while the <a
            href="/library/pain/williamson/">anesthetic won't
            eliminate 100 percent of the infant's pain</a>, it
            works well, and most of the time the babies are quiet
            during the procedure.</p>

            <p>Earlier in the day, <a
            href="http://www.meritcare.com/guidebook/directories/info.asp?id=837"
            target="_blank">Dr. Craig Shoemaker</a>, lead
            pediatrician for MeritCare when Flatt had her child
            circumcised in 1997, told jurors he felt the care
            Kantak provided met American Academy of Pediatrics
            standards.</p>

            <p>He said he came to that conclusion by reviewing
            medical records.</p>

            <p>During cross examination, Baer asked Shoemaker if he
            was making assumptions in coming to his conclusion.</p>

            <p>Shoemaker, one of six doctors appointed to review
            circumcision for the <a href="http://www.aap.org/"
            target="_blank">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> in
            1997 and now at the <a
            href="http://www-med.ucdavis.edu/"
            target="_blank">University of California, Davis</a>,
            said he assumed what was documented in the medical
            records was done.</p>

            <p>He also said Kantak was known for providing parents
            thorough discussions about circumcision while he was at
            MeritCare.</p>

            <p>Shoemaker is a witness for the defense. Because of a
            scheduling conflict, he was allowed to testify before
            the plaintiffs finished calling their witnesses.</p>

            <p>Flatt, an attorney at <a
            href="http://www.zbaer.com/" target="_blank">Baer's law
            firm</a>, is asking for an unspecified amount in
            damages.</p>

            <p>The trial, which is in its eighth day, is expected
            to end this week.</p>
