            <h2>Cutting comments: the foreskin debate</h2>

            <h4>Some say it&rsquo;s barbaric, others a matter of
            hygiene. But with babies dying from circumcision,
            should it continue? Our correspondent hears from the
            &lsquo;intactivists&rsquo;</h4>

            <p><b>Simon Mills</b></p>

            <p>The actor Alan Cumming gets quite a reaction when he
            drops his trousers. Especially in America. Why? His
            penis is uncircumcised. He is genitally intact, a
            cavalier rather than a roundhead. His johnson wears an
            opera cape, as they say in US gay circles. This gives
            him something akin to freak status in the
            hygiene-obsessed States, where 70% of the mature male
            population have been circumcised.<br />
            <br />
             Cumming, an endearingly puckish type, is really rather
            proud of his foreskin. &ldquo;During interviews in
            America, I have made a point of talking about
            it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s insane
            that an entire nation is ignorant about a part of their
            body they have lost. When I take my pants off in
            America, people gasp, which is kind of nice, until I
            realise that they&rsquo;re actually staring at my penis
            as if it&rsquo;s some kind of National Geographic photo
            come to life. Nobody has a foreskin there.
            They&rsquo;re, like, &lsquo;Wow! What do you do with
            that? How does it work?&rsquo; &rdquo;<br />
            <br />
             Why is it that so many American men are circumcised?
            Well, it seems the Brits are responsible. Queen
            Victoria, who, along with much of the British
            aristocracy, believed that the English descended from
            one of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, chose to have her
            sons circumcised. It became fashionable, and the
            procedure travelled to America. It was there that John
            Harvey Kellogg campaigned for circumcision as a cure
            for masturbation, which was, in his opinion, a cause of
            psychological problems. And ever since (in the 1950s,
            it is estimated, 90% of American boys were snipped),
            middle-class Americans have grown up believing that
            foreskins are filthy, wholly unnecessary fleshy
            adjuncts that harbour disease and make a sensitive
            teenage boy something of a fairground attraction in the
            communal-shower environment.<br />
            <br />
             That&rsquo;s why the uncut likes of Nick Nolte,
            Leonardo DiCaprio, Willem Dafoe, Emilio Estevez,
            Nicolas Cage and Keanu Reeves, all born during the
            barbaric period of the last millennium, are listed on
            pro-foreskin websites as if they were all some kind of
            heroic locker-room maverick.<br />
            <br />
             Blame Cumming and the unlikely figure of Ben Affleck,
            if you like, but the circumcision debate has suddenly
            caught the attention of a new breed of quietly militant
            pro-choicers and so-called &ldquo;intactivists&rdquo;
            who are putting foreskins to the fore again and
            unleashing some appropriately cutting comments from the
            high-minded and famous.<br />
            <br />
             Men with foreskins squirm and buttock-clench
            comedically when the subject is broached, while men who
            were cut as babies can&rsquo;t see what all the fuss is
            about. Foreskins are said to heighten sexual pleasure
            but harbour disease. Circumcised men are said to suffer
            from, wait for it, &ldquo;significant penile sensory
            deficit&rdquo;, although &ndash; get this &ndash; a
            Men&rsquo;s Health magazine survey in 2000 suggested
            that uncircumcised men lasted an average of four
            minutes longer during sex than their circumcised
            peers.<br />
            <br />
             Pressure groups such as Brothers United for Future
            Foreskins (Buff) and Uncircumcising Information and
            Resources Center (Uncirc), and even <a
            href="http://www.jewsagainstcircumcision.org/"
            target="_blank">Jews Against Circumcision</a>, fronted
            by Rabbi Moses Maimonides, do their best to break with
            tradition and prevent unnecessary cuts in the United
            States, while Cumming and the art critic Brian Sewell
            are both spokesmen for the British branch of the <a
            href="http://norm.org/" target="_blank">National
            Organization of Restoring Men</a> (Norm, originally
            known as Recover a Penis, or Recap), founded in 1989
            for men hoping to restore their foreskins. Foreskin
            restoration? It can be done. Sort of.<br />
            <br />
             Medical techniques are not sufficiently advanced to
            give back the erogenous tissue and nerves amputated at
            circumcision, but careful stretching can create a more
            natural-looking penis, and softening the epithelium (or
            outer tissue) of the glans (or tip) can return the
            penis to a much higher level of sensitivity. The
            pro-choicers feel that they are on a roll right now.
            Non-medical circumcision for children is now illegal in
            Sweden. The numbers of circumcision procedures in the
            UK are slowly declining and, after peaking in the
            1930s, when 35% of British boys were snipped, fell to a
            mere 6.5% in the 1980s. Today, only 12,200
            circumcisions are performed in the UK annually. Most of
            them go ahead without a hitch. A few end in
            tragedy.<br />
            <br />
             The inquest into the <a
            href="http://www.cirp.org/news/theguardian2007-02-17/"
            target="_blank">death of Amitai Moshe</a>, who was just
            seven days old when he stopped breathing after being
            circumcised at a synagogue in north London last
            February &ndash; he died a week later from a heart
            attack &ndash; is to be held tomorrow at Hornsey
            coroner&rsquo;s court. &ldquo;No causal link has been
            established between the circumcision and the baby being
            taken ill. There is no indication that this was
            anything other than a tragic juxtaposition of two
            events,&rdquo; a spokesman for the synagogue said after
            the child&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;The mohel [appointed
            circumciser] is a registered member of the <a
            href="http://www.initiationsociety.org/"
            target="_blank">Initiation Society</a>, which has been
            licensing and training practitioners of the procedure
            for more than 200 years. It is a well-established and
            well-regulated practice.&rdquo;<br />
            <br />
             Anti-circumcision horror stories such as this have
            served only to rally the pro-choice, intactivist PR
            machine. As well as Affleck, who has made it known that
            he is against routine infant circumcision, celebrity
            supporters include Colin Farrell. Affleck, it should be
            noted, was apparently circumcised in adulthood, after
            suffering injury during the filming of a superhero
            movie; a doctor decided that removing his foreskin
            would be easier than repairing it. Which has to
            hurt.<br />
            <br />
             But this isn&rsquo;t just about cautiously radical
            telegenic celebrities or grown men checking one another
            out at the urinals or intact males doing histrionic
            winces and leg-crosses at the thought of the dreaded
            bris. For parents, there&rsquo;s a basic guilt issue at
            play, too. In his eloquently incensed invective against
            religion, God Is Not Great, the firebrand polemicist
            Christopher Hitchens rails against parents who have
            their boys circumcised.<br />
            <br />
             &ldquo;As to immoral practice,&rdquo; he writes,
            &ldquo;it is hard to imagine anything more grotesque
            than the mutilation of an infant&rsquo;s
            genitalia.&rdquo; He argues that circumcision weakens
            the faculty of sexual excitement and diminishes its
            pleasure, pointing out the significance of the
            operation being performed on babies rather than those
            who have reached the age of reason. (One study found
            that 92% of male infants subject to circumcision were
            not given anaesthetic during the procedure.)<br />
            <br />
             Unconcerned that militant Jewish factions rancorously
            dismiss the intactivist lobby as wholly antisemitic,
            Hitchens states that, as recently as 2005, a mohel in
            New York City quite legally performed a ritual known as
            metzitzah (taking a mouthful of wine and then sucking
            the blood from the circumcision wound) on newborn
            babies, <a href="/news/jewishweek02-10-05/"
            target="_blank">giving genital herpes to several small
            boys</a> and causing the death of at least two.<br />
            <br />
             And what happens to all those lopped-off foreskins?
            Believe it or not, there is a handsome profit to be
            made from harvested bits of young penis. The <a
            href="http://www.norm-uk.org/" target="_blank">Norm UK
            website</a> features the following item: &ldquo;Since
            the 1980s, private hospitals have been involved in the
            business of supplying discarded foreskins to private
            bio-research laboratories and pharmaceutical companies,
            who require human flesh as raw research material. Human
            foreskins are in great demand for commercial
            enterprises, and the marketing of purloined baby
            foreskins is a multimillion-dollar-a-year
            industry.&rdquo;<br />
            <br />
             There is even an expensive face cream, SkinMedica, on
            the market, made from a formula grown from young
            foreskins. Yes. Really.<br />
            <br />
             &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sinister side to all
            this,&rdquo; Cumming says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tradition,
            control and pleasure-removing masquerading as a hygiene
            thing. What it comes down to is mass genital
            mutilation. It&rsquo;s barbaric. I don&rsquo;t mean to
            offend anyone, but I&rsquo;ve heard about men who
            can&rsquo;t orgasm for ages because they have no
            sensation. People in America are impeded, because they
            don&rsquo;t feel, you know?&rdquo;<br />
            <br />
             There have been a number of studies conducted to find
            out whether male circumcision reduces the risk of
            acquiring sexually transmitted diseases, including
            HIV/Aids. While some of them show it may reduce the
            risk, they are not entirely conclusive, and using a
            condom still offers the best protection.<br />
            <br />
             For Cumming, it&rsquo;s more of an emotive issue.
            &ldquo;As far as I am concerned, the default-setting
            arguments about hygiene just don&rsquo;t stand
            up,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The sanitation issue,
            especially, always comes up when I am in America. But
            you know what? I am very clean. I shower
            frequently.<br />
            <br />
             &ldquo;I am very proud of my foreskin. I believe
            it&rsquo;s there for a purpose. And I just want people
            to stop and think for a second before they decide to
            get a big bit of their newborn son&rsquo;s cock cut
            off.&rdquo;</p>
