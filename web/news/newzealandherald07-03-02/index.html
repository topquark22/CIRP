            <h2>Grisly initiation rite</h2>
            29.06.2002 

            <p>JOHANNESBURG - South Africa is convulsed in
            soul-searching after details emerged of an initiation
            rite in which five young men were killed and 19 injured
            in scenes reminiscent of William Golding's Lord of the
            Flies.</p>

            <p>The <a href="/news/natalwitness07-01-02/">horrific
            details</a> of the ceremony are being revealed by those
            who survived the ordeal on Nooitgedacht Farm, in a
            remote area near the mountain town of Heidelberg, about
            40km east of Johannesburg.</p>

            <p>Some of the victims, teenagers and young men, were
            lured to the bush under the pretext that the manhood
            initiation ceremony would be "fun-filled".</p>

            <p>But instead the boys were crudely circumcised,
            beaten and left naked in freezing temperatures. Others
            were kidnapped and forced to join in.</p>

            <p><a href="/news/sapa06-26-02/">Those who survived
            narrowly escaped having to eat the heart of one
            boy</a>, who was beaten to death, by the time the
            police had arrived on Wednesday.</p>

            <p>At traditional initiation ceremonies, young men,
            mostly aged 18, undergo rituals and are given guidance
            and advice for their transition into manhood. The
            ceremonies, which last about three to four weeks, are
            run by inyangas, or traditional healers.</p>

            <p>The ceremonies are normally held in winter and naked
            boys are protected from the cold by rudimentary shacks
            they build themselves.</p>

            <p>But details of the scene at two camps in the bush on
            Nooitgedacht Farm have shocked South Africans.</p>

            <p>Within one camp, a makeshift structure covered with
            plastic, hardly large enough to shelter two adults, let
            alone 32 of them, had been erected. This is where the
            young men were kept for nearly three weeks.</p>

            <p>One survivor, Allan Mofokeng, 14, related the ordeal
            of one of the victims, Amos Mkhwanazi, 22, who died
            after trying to escape. He says Mkhwanazi was found a
            few hours after he ran away and brought back to the
            camp where he was stripped naked, had icy water thrown
            over him, and was thrashed with a heavy stick.</p>

            <p>Five men responsible for the camps have been charged
            with murder and assault.</p>
