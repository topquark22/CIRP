            <h2>Eight initiates die in Eastern Cape</h2>

            <p>January 02, 2007, 19:45</p>

            <p>Eight initiates have died in the Eastern Cape since
            the start of the initiation season two months ago, the
            provincial health department said today.</p>

            <p>"This is a decrease in the number of deaths at the
            same time last year when 15 initiates died," Sizwe
            Kupelo, department spokesperson said. "And only six of
            the eight died due to circumcision related problems.
            One of the other two boys was murdered, while the other
            died in a fire at his school."</p>

            <p>The deaths were reported in the Umtata, Queenstown
            and Port Elizabeth areas. Kupelo said the department
            would work together with traditional leaders to ensure
            that no initiates were killed during the initiation
            period this year. "We hope that this year we are going
            to have a zero death rate. We have embarked on a
            massive awareness campaign, we are going to review
            strategies and work with traditional leaders."</p>

            <p>He added that many people had heeded the
            department's call last year to send children to
            legitimate initiation schools, thereby reducing the
            number of deaths. However, he said, there were still
            some boys who were circumcised by men pretending to be
            traditional leaders. "But we have managed to arrest
            three bogus traditional leaders who circumcised boys in
            December. They spent Christmas and New Year's behind
            bars and will appear in court at the end of January.
            "We take this seriously and will not tolerate people
            taking innocent lives in the name of the custom," said
            Kupelo.</p>

            <p><b>Department recognised custom</b><br />
             He said the department recognised and respected the
            custom, but would stop people who were trying to make
            money out of it. There was also the possibility of boys
            contracting HIV/Aids at bogus initiation schools. "You
            get these fly-by-night schools who sometimes call boys
            in the village and circumcise about 50 without cleaning
            the instrument," said Kupelo. "If the first boy has
            HIV/Aids the rest will get it."</p>

            <p>Kupelo said more then 400 monitors were deployed to
            schools to ensure that the initiation process was
            handled properly. Problems started when the people who
            nursed the boys after initiation did not perform their
            jobs properly. Some boys were abused, while others who
            experienced complications after initiation were not
            taken to hospital on time.</p>

            <p>Kupelo said a review process would begin within the
            next few months to work on ways to prevent these
            problems and to ensure that there were no deaths at
            initiation schools in the province this year. -
