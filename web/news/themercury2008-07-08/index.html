            <p>East London: The circumcision death toll in the
            Eastern Cape has reached 20.<br />
            <br />

            Spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said a 15-year-old died in an
            illegal initiation school in the Lusikisiki area at the
            weekend.<br />
            <br />
             Another 72 initiates were admitted to various
            hospitals over the weekend and yesterday, mostly
            suffering from dehydration or septic wounds. Nine of
            them had already been discharged.<br />
            <br />
             The department, working closely with police, has been
            conducting raids to shut down illegal initiation
            schools. Several unregistered traditional surgeons and
            nurses have been arrested. - Sapa</p>
