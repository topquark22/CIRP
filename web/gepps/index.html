    <p>Glenn Mitchellson John Epps passed away on October 11, 1997
    at the age of 31 years. At the time of his death, Glenn was
    residing in Stayner, Ontario, Canada, close to Georgian
    Bay.</p>

    <p>The following biographical information is reproduced from
    the dustjacket of Glenn's book, <i>Distortions of
    Reality</i>:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The author Glenn M.J. Epps, was born on August 11, 1966 in
      the Town of Ajax, Ontario, Canada; Ajax is a very short
      distance from Toronto, Ontario. Glenn lived in this general
      area until the age of ten, at which time his family moved to
      Solina, Ontario. Solina is a small country village and had a
      population of about 250 at that time. Glenn attended high
      school at Courtice Secondary School. This was a small high
      school having approximately 700 students. University studies
      were done at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, where
      he earned an honors degree in Administration and Policy
      Studies. Again a small university - in fact, one of the
      smallest universities in Canada.</p>

      <p>Glenn M.J. Epps has an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 180
      and has instant recall better known as a "photographic
      memory". At the incredible early age of fourteen, Glenn
      started his first business; this business was started without
      guidance, prompting or assistance from anyone. He began a
      computer software sales company which did business all around
      the world; most of the company's sales taking place in the
      United States.</p>

      <p>Glenn M.J. Epps has just written "Distortions of Reality",
      sure to be a #1 BESTSELLER.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Glenn, thank you for the many contributions you have made to
    humanity. We are saddened at your passing, and will miss
    you.</p>
